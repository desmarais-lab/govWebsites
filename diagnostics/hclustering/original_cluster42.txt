DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL
The Department of Animal Care and Control faces the public health and safety issues involving animals
using a proactive approach. Protection of citizens and animals, animal rescue, and efforts to minimize
euthanasia of unwanted animals through spay/neuter promotion all strongly reflect the neighborhood and
community driven origins of this agency. Local and state legislation is used to address cruelty or violence
issues involving animals, pet overpopulation, and responsible pet ownership issues. The success of the
approach would not be possible without positive community outreach and education.
The city ordinance delineates the laws to be enforced and the responsibilities of the department toward
achieving an overall professional and quality program. The ordinance is seen as a model in the country
and this department has been recognized nationally as a leader in the field, with multiple employees who
have been national instructors in specific areas of the profession. Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control
will continue to provide high levels of service in all areas and continue enforcement aimed at the
protection and assistance of both community residents and animals. W e will strive to increase promotion
of responsible animal ownership to increase the safety levels in our community and to combat pet
overpopulation and its resulting euthanasia of domestic animals.

Programming and Initiatives
This past year we have continued to expand our outreach opportunities for adoptable pets as well as our
cruelty investigation initiatives. Local non-profit agencies that are better armed to focus on adoption initiatives
through grant opportunities and enhanced spay/neuter efforts at high volume with targeted work are now more
available than ever before in our community. The primary focus of a government agency has to be health,
safety, and cruelty prevention efforts. That ultimately limits our abilities and resources for highest possible
adoption rates if we do not have active community partners. I am happy to say our partnerships are stronger
than they have ever been, both locally and nationally.
The ultimate goal of any adoption program is saving lives. A s a government agency we receive the highest
volume of animals in all of northeast Indiana. S o m e of those animals are not safe to move back out to the
community, but many are simply in need of opportunities that cannot be found without aggressive efforts at
proactively finding space and resources to assist them. Our agency has been meeting those challenges by
pursuing partnerships to assist us in rehoming animals beyond the volume that our own adoption center
space, hours, and staffing allows. W e work closely with both the Allen County S P C A and the Whitley County
Humane Society to transfer animals for adoption while still keeping our adoption floor full. W e have non-profit
rescue organizations that foster animals in private homes, then place to their forever homes from there.
When even that is not enough, the Michigan Humane Society has agreed to transport dogs up into their
suburban shelters as they are unable to meet the demand for small dogs in their area. All this partnering
allows our own shelter to open more space for our community pets that are temporarily lost by their owners, to
quarantine bite cases, or to house the victims of cruelty, neglect, and abuse. The overall result of all this
cooperation is a safer city, an increase in placements, and more opportunities for those animals with minor
issues that need to be addressed before adoption. So, more lives saved. W e track success through a figure
called our "Live Release Rate" and 2012 brought the highest success ever in that area; not only for F W A C C ,
but for our Community Coalition totals as well.
This budget reflects a maintenance approach to our current programming recognizing the fiscal constraints we
all face at this time. At the same time we are also seeing personnel, vendor, and service provider's prices
rising. In the last two years we have downsized employee numbers by count and by hours. Yet, our cruelty
and neglect prosecutions are at an all-time high with criminal conviction rates rising to a level never seen in
Fort Wayne before. That is due to staff dedication, training, community outreach education, and an extremely
supportive law department and prosecutors office. Our plan is to continue these creative and collaborative
approaches that ultimately result in a safer community and more life saving prospects for our animals.

Goals and Objectives
Our Mission: Guided by the humane ethic and livability interests within our neighborhoods, the
mission of Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control is to ensure public health and safety as well as
prevent pet overpopulation, animal neglect, and animal cruelty through education, rescue, and
law enforcement.

Fort Wayne, subsequently reducing the number of related safety issues and the number of animals
currently being euthanized.
To increase the level of responsible pet ownership thus reducing animal related problems at the
neighborhood level and indiscriminate breeding of animals in the city.
To increase education levels of both children and adults relative to safety, humane care and treatment
of animals, responsible pet ownership and the plight of unwanted animals.
To continue promotion of all local available opportunities for families unable to afford the spay or
neuter surgery for their pet.
To increase contacts with owners regarding proper identification and registration of their pets for safe
return and the opportunity to return lost pets directly to owners homes rather than impounding them at
the shelter.

For Heaven’s Sake

A Division of Public
Safety Serving the
City of Fort Wayne

Children, dogs and abundant family at a holiday
get-together usually mean a great time for all.
The joyous Christmas season can bring many
delights, but for one small dog the holiday
gathering of 2009 spelled disaster.

Meeting Standards
for Animal Sheltering
and Control
Set Forth by the
Humane Society of
the United States

SPRING 2011

Doug Shumate had traveled outside of Markle,
Indiana towards Huntington just days before
Christmas to enjoy a holiday dinner with family.
He was joined by his beloved companion, a 9
year old female Cairn terrier named Seventh
Heaven, to share in the festivities.
As is common with large gatherings, doors
are opened, people come and go throughout
the day and that is likely how little Seventh
Heaven managed to slip away unnoticed from the home. When she was discovered missing,
everyone began a frantic search, but she was nowhere to be found. Doug was forced to
leave without his dog to make the drive home alone.
Heaven’s story from that point is a blank page. Where was she? Would she survive the
cold? Was she hurt or hit by a car? Had someone picked her up and kept her? All of those
questions weighed heavily on Doug Shumate’s heart and mind until she suddenly reappeared
almost nine months to the day of her disappearance.
Mr. Shumate answered a call from our department on September 22nd of 2010. We informed
him that we were in possession of a stray Cairn terrier with a microchip identifying him as
the owner. He, of course, agreed to drive to the shelter to see the dog, but he was certain it
would not be his dog.
We explained that the dog had been reported to us by a woman who discovered the dirty,
scraggly stray resting on her porch. When Doug first saw the Cairn’s condition he said no, it
was not her. But with a second look he spotted his little Heaven beneath that rough-looking
exterior. What an emotional reunion for us all and what a great testimony for a pet microchip!
The most amazing part of the story is that somehow this brave little dog had traveled such a
distance to end up on the front porch of a home in the same housing addition and within the
same one hundred block as the Shumate home.
Tightly holding his little dog, Mr. Shumate was clearly baffled by the mystery. He stated,
“When you live by yourself, they become your companion. They look forward to you coming
home at night. I missed her and I’m happy to have her back.”
So, how on earth did the aging Cairn terrier get home? How did she manage to travel the 30
to 40 miles from outside of Markle, IN to just blocks from her home in northwest Fort Wayne?
We don’t know . . . Heaven only knows.

From the Director
Stopping the Cycle of Abuse
Chico came to us yesterday, almost dead. As I
write this story, it is a risk because we still do not
know if he will live, still do not know if his ending
will be a happy one. Warrants officers serving a
search warrant found him abandoned, near death,
and in skeletal condition due to his level of neglect.
A toddler was removed from the home as well.
Cruelty in its many forms is something we see at
Animal Care and Control more often than anyone
Belinda Lewis, Executive
Director, and her new adopted

steeled to it. We do not. Chico represents all
those animals that we have not been able to save.
He is a great hope and that warm success that our staff need in order to know
they are doing the right thing by staying in this profession. When you see what
they see, sometimes it is hard to stay.
The results of animal neglect have disastrous consequences. The reasons
for its inception are complex and have been found to branch out to children
and other victims in a family. It is called the cycle of abuse. To stop the
cycle, we have to catch and stop the abuser. The state has a guideline for
criminal prosecution of animal cruelty. In general, a defendant has to have
committed cruelty or neglect “recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally”. The
reason Chico is different than many of our cases is that he was found before it
was too late and the officers had the
owner right there on the spot. Far

Dear FWACC Staff,
It’s been a whole year since we came to
meet the Vizsla “Kona”. We know him as
Kava and he adapted to his new name
really well. We were a little worried
since our Weimaraner was already
named Kona.
Kava has been a wonderful addition
to our home and been out on many
adventures with us. We’ve gone hiking,
boating, and on a trip to Illinois. He even
joined me at the Halloween Pet Parade this year! Here are a few
photos for the staff and volunteers to enjoy.

WISH LIST:
If you are looking for a worthy
service project for a club or if
you are a pet lover willing to
lend a hand, the following list
of items is much needed by
our department. We cared
for 16,516 animals last year,
so supplies are always on
our list. Any donation is

Hop to Adopt a Rescued Rabbit
At Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control,
we love rabbits. We just hate to see
rabbits become homeless. With a
little research and preparation a pet
rabbit can be part of your family
to enjoy a long happy bunny life.
Rabbits have a life span of ten or more
years, so research is critical. They
have special needs to thoroughly
understand before making that longterm commitment.
Here are some tips to consider...
•

Domestic rabbits will quickly
succumb to extreme temperatures,
so inside living is essential

• Electrical cords are dangerous to a
chewing rabbit, so bunny proof play
areas and supervise well

• To determine cage length, multiply
the rabbits length time five. Be
sure he can stand on his back legs
without bumping his head on the
top of his cage.
• Use proper bedding in the rabbit’s
cage such as Care Fresh. Avoid
pine and cedar.
• Rabbits have complex digestive
systems. They need Timothy hay,
timothy-based pellets, a variety of
dark green vegetables and they
enjoy fruits and carrots as occasional
treats. Fruits might include: apples,
peaches, blueberries and melon.
• Supply ample fresh water daily and
keep plenty of chewing toys and
untreated wood blocks available for
your rabbit.

Rabbits are fun, social animals that
bring laughter and companionship
to the home. Research, planning
and supervision can make all the
difference and it’s the best formula
for success. When you are ready to
add a rabbit to your family, visit us at
Animal Care & Control.

Children Learn Valuable Lessons in Safety
Animal Care & Control’s Education Department was
pleased to partner once again with Student Focus on
Health, a Midwest Alliance for Health Education, in an
effort to keep children safe. The community affairs project
targets elementary through high school age students with
presentations traditionally offered in the fall.
The ultimate goal is to encourage healthy lifestyles
beginning in early childhood in hopes of promoting a long
productive life. With age-appropriate topics, students are
made aware of the impact of unhealthy habits, and are
taught alternative choices to improve their health and well
being.
Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control’s emphasis is to teach
students safe and respectful behaviors when they interact Sharmalene Gunawardena, Animal Care & Control Education
with animals, and, more specifically, how to avoid being Assistant, teaches Village Elementary students how to avoid
an animal bite.
bitten or scratched by an animal. Through pictures of
dogs in various stances, students better understand potential threats when they see stiffness or staring, a lip
curl, or various signals that indicate a stressed animal. Our goal is to teach students what to do, what not to do,
and to assess a dog’s body language in time to remove themselves before it elevates to a bite.
In total, 1,960 middle school students and 1,077 4th and 5th grade students were educated on many different
aspects of health including bite safety education.

Whisker Wag’n

Taking Pet Adoptions on the Road
In our mission to find more homes for homeless animals in Fort
Wayne, we proudly present a new and exciting venture for pet
adoptions. We call it the Whisker Wag’n!

From the
Director
...continued from page 2

The Whisker Wag’n is a mobile adoption unit that is allowing
our department to showcase some of our most adorable pets in
hopes of reaching potential adopters throughout our community
. . . wherever they are! This unit, the only one of its kind in
Allen County, hit the road in November of 2010 and immediately
broadened our outreach to new venues and new hours. Pet
loving fans were excited to find dogs, puppies, cats, kittens
and even pockets pets aboard the vehicle. All eagerly awaiting
adoption into new and loving homes!
The Animal Care & Control Whisker Wag’n is always looking
to “get its paws” involved with new and exciting events that
offer substantial adoption opportunities! If you have an event
that matches our criteria, call us to schedule a Whisker Wag’n
appearance.
The sponsorship fee of $250
includes a maximum 4 hour
appearance and helps to
offset expenses as we hit the
road to showcase animals
that might not otherwise
be seen as extensively
throughout the community. If
you would like to underwrite
an appearance, give us a
call at 427-5511 to make a
sponsorship donation.

cruelty and neglect requires intervention
and the eyes of the community are the
only way we can stop it. Hopefully Chico
can be the catalyst that the next family
member, neighbor, or friend needs to
see in order to make that phone call
regarding a neglected animal. The
reward we see in Fort Wayne is in
knowing that all agencies at all levels in
our community will not tolerate this kind
of treatment of animals and will work
together to prosecute it to it’s fullest.
There is a warm side to all of Chico’s
misery. After the news coverage of his
plight, the community outpouring has
been enormous and the prosecutor’s
office is already working the case with
the Sheriff’s Department and with us.
I noticed our own staff going above
and beyond to be sure Chico’s needs
were being met and his veterinary care
requirements were being passed along
to each shift with extra attention. In spite
of his current medical condition, he is
snuggling with his caregivers and giving
kisses this morning. Tragedy can bring
cohesion to a mission. Chico is that
reminder for us all as to why we are here
and why we stay. Make him the reason
you pick up the phone.

Keep Dogs Leashed in City Parks
We have seen considerable attention given to our community
parks and the heightened initiatives taken to keep them safe
and enjoyable for everyone. We particularly applaud efforts
to safeguard children and provide them with a wholesome
experience while they play and learn in our parks. In that same
light, Park Department officials, Animal Care & Control, and
numerous members of the public have raised concerns regarding
unleashed dogs in the parks.
People love to have their dogs with them when they play, walk,
jog, and picnic. On any given day you’ll see an assortment of
delighted canines joyfully accompanying an owner on a park
outing. Dogs are welcome in the parks, but making certain they
are leashed and under control is required.

Please be respectful by keeping your
dog properly leashed.

Before heading out for quality park time with your dog, here are important guidelines for everyone to follow:
• Without exception, dogs are to remain on a standard sixfoot leash. Parks contain resources that can be seriously
damaged by dogs that are not properly restrained.
• Joggers, hikers, and bicyclists should be safe to enjoy
the parks without being confronted by an off-leash dog
no matter how personable the dog may be.
• Supervise your dog and don’t allow them to dig or
destroy vegetation.

• Sanitation is the responsibility of each dog owner. Keep
a bag attached to the handle of your dog’s leash, so that
you will be prepared to clean up after your dog. Your
cooperation in keeping the parks clean will add to the
health and enjoyment of people and other dogs.
• If a dog bites a person or animal while running loose on
public property, the owner receives a summons to court
and the dog is quarantined by state law for ten days.
In Allen County, animals in these circumstances are
quarantined at our shelter.

Please be respectful by keeping your dog properly leashed.

A Heart Wrapped in Fur

Sometimes you get a second chance in life; our dog, Toby, certainly did.
We adopted the one year old, long-haired, skinny, untrained, abused mutt from the Animal Shelter 13 years ago. He
spent his entire life bringing calamity, chaos, character and charm into our home.

In Memory of

We figured he had never been in a house before. The table, especially with food on it, was
within reach and his. Couches and chairs, especially occupied, were a joy to share, a true 85
pound lap dog. Manners and restraint weren’t in his “vocabulary” but he learned.
His insecurity required his human to lie beside him on the floor for a year until he trusted us.
A walk was only good at 50 mph. And after being brushed and a good shake, he was back to
being shabby chic.
On February 15, 2011, with arthritis, lumps and bumps, and failing health, Toby was put to rest.
His devotion cannot be measured or merited. He was truly a “Heart Wrapped in Fur”.
His gift of devotion and love inspired us to shelter volunteering and fostering. Please use this
donation for the Angel Fund, a second chance for another animal.
Sincerely,

Toby

Marty and Vince LaBarbera

SPOTLIGHT VOLUNTEER - Nancy Brown
How long have you been volunteering?
I hadn’t worked in 10 years, my daughters had moved out and on with their lives, and
the last straw was losing Lucien, my boxer. He was 8 ½ years old and had deterioration
of the hips. We had to let him go when he could no longer stand up. I was having a
difficult time dealing with the loss of my beloved Lucien and finally decided I needed a
diversion. I’ve been volunteering since May 2009.
What inspired you to volunteer with FWACC?
I have always wanted to volunteer and work with animals. At that particular time in my life, I knew that’s where I
had to be…around animals. I was spending time with other animals that I felt needed love and attention, and in
return I was healing. This experience has definitely increased my knowledge on how the shelter actually works.
There is so much hard work that goes into taking care of all these wonderful animals.
What do you do with the animals and in what events have you been involved?
My main function is to clean and prepare the dog areas for adoptions. On occasion, I have cleaned the cat rooms
and the cages of the small animals, i.e. rabbits, guinea pigs. I especially enjoy taking the adoption dogs to the
Pooch Playground. It’s great to see them running and playing.
I have participated in Neuter for a Nickel. After the male cats came out of surgery, I transported them to the
room where the owners were to pick them up. I have also been a greeter in the male ward during the shelter’s
Christmas Open House for the Animals. At the annual Walk for Animals fundraiser, I have helped with registration
and collecting the pledges.
What do you find to be the most rewarding part of volunteering?
I am very passionate about the well being of all animals. It is a great reward to meet and work with so many
people that share that same passion.

Adoption Efforts Sit Up And Get Noticed!
The 2010 year was filled with creative efforts, unique
opportunities, and great successes for the adoption
program here at Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control.
Overall, we were able to find loving homes for 2,265
pets that needed tender, loving care. Included in our
pet adoptions for the year, we also placed 492 pets
with rescue groups and found homes for 111 small pets
including rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils,
birds, rats, chinchillas, pot-bellied pigs, chickens, goats
and fish. And, to add more excitement to our success
for the year, we are proud to say that over 20,000
visitors came through our Pet Adoption Center to see our
adoptable pets throughout the year!

Reaching Out

Thanks to an overwhelming amount of volunteer support,
we continued to open our Pet Adoption Center on the 1st
and 3rd Saturdays of every month. As we had hoped,
our Saturday Adoption Extravaganza’s were the most
successful adoption days of the month. These special
adoption days brought in almost 2,000 potential adopters
that may not have had the opportunity to find a new pet
during our limited weekday hours. Many adorable kittens
and puppies found their way into loving hearts during
those wonderful Saturday adoption events!
One of our newest creative ventures was a collaborative
effort with the Fort Wayne Ballet to include our adoptable
dogs in the Nutcracker performances. We labeled these
12 dogs as our “Muttcrackers”, and they took the stage
with the dancers at 12 performances this past December.
It was an overwhelming success, and each of the featured
Muttcrackers was adopted either during the event or
shortly thereafter. We are looking forward to a long
lasting relationship with the Fort Wayne Ballet and jump
at unique ventures such as featuring our adoptable dogs
in their performances of Coppelia this past March. If you
missed any of these performances, keep watch for others
that we hope may be coming.

Helping Paws

Thanks to a generous Maddie’s Fund Grant, we were
able to hold a very successful cat adoption event
called the Feline Frenzy. In hopes of finding homes
for the overwhelming number of cats and kittens we
see throughout the summer months, we decreased
our cat adoption fee to only $10 during the months of
May through August 2010. The Feline Frenzy was so
successful that we were able to place almost 400 cats
during that timeframe.
Another way that we are helping paws is through our
monthly Pet Parenting Class. This free class is offered the
first Monday of every month and is open to anyone in the
community who needs help learning how to manage their
dog’s behaviors. The class is held in an open-forum style
and the trainer ensures that everyone gets help with their
particular behavior concerns. Last year we had 59 people
attend these training sessions.

Adoption Partners

Working with local pet stores that don’t sell puppies and
kittens has been a very successful way for us to bring
our mission, as well as our adoptable pets, into the
community. We continued our excellent relationship with
Pet Supplies Plus through the joint offsite cat adoption
center, Kitty City. This relationship has allowed us to find
homes for an additional148 cats and kittens that might not
have otherwise found the chance at a new home.
Lastly, thanks to the support from the Fort Wayne Mad
Ants and the Fort Wayne Tin Caps, we were invited to
bring adoptable dogs to several of their games last year.
We attended a number of Mad Ants games where they
showcased our dogs on their Jumbotron for all of their fans
to see! And the Tin Caps featured us as their Community
Organization of the Game and allowed us to throw the
first pitch! We will continue to foster our relationships with
these groups in 2011 in order showcase more and more
of our adoptable pets to community events.

DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL
The Department of Animal Care and Control faces the public health and safety issues involving animals
using a proactive approach. Protection of citizens and animals, animal rescue, and efforts to minimize
euthanasia of unwanted animals through spay/neuter promotion all strongly reflect the neighborhood and
community driven origins of this agency. Local and state legislation is used to address pet
overpopulation, responsible pet ownership issues, and cruelty or violence issues involving animals. The
success of the approach would not be possible without positive community outreach and education, the
job of our Humane Education Department. Involvement of the citizens through our volunteering program
has also been crucial to departmental advancement. This department’s county contracts provide an
overall “one stop” for city and county residents in need of services, wishing to adopt an animal, seeking
educational outreach materials, or assistance with lost/found pets.
The ordinance, adopted by City Council in 1982 and amended as recently as 2004, delineates the laws to
be enforced and the responsibilities of the department toward achieving an overall professional and
quality program. This department has been recognized nationally as a leader in the field and employs
multiple national instructors in specific areas of the profession.
The department will continue to provide high levels of service in all areas of animal care and control and
continue enforcement aimed at the protection and assistance of both man and animal. We will strive to
increase promotion of responsible animal ownership to combat pet overpopulation and the resulting
euthanasia of animals and negative impact to our neighborhoods caused by animal excesses.

Programming and Initiatives
This budget reflects a maintenance approach to our current programming with plans to expand public
safety initiatives and hopes of doing so without added expense beyond annexation commitments. The
General Assembly passed animal fighting legislation that we have been aggressively pursuing to assist
us in our efforts to decrease animal based violence in the community while assisting the war on drugs,
weapons, gambling, and related crimes.
We continue to watch animal handling volumes and their effects on the shelter, the city, and our
neighborhoods. The direction of the department has carried a heavy adoption focus over the last three
years and continues to set trends for the agency at this time. The mission of the department remains
public health and safety as it pertains to animals. As we strive to meet that mission, the demands on our
animal care division continue to soar. Close examination of pet overpopulation issues and prevention of
the birth of unwanted animals prior to relinquishment to the city have been identified as key for future
efforts toward expense stabilization and potential reduction.
In previous discussion of what the future holds for our department, we have addressed the potential
arrival of a raccoon rabies epidemic approaching from the east coast. Currently, the state of Ohio has
contained the situation using oral rabies vaccine baiting. At this time the initial forecasted movement
directly toward our county has been diminished by the baiting activity. This agency continues to provide
nationally recognized levels of animal bite prevention programming and reaction. Fort Wayne is the only
identified city in this country with a “reverse” bite statistic, showing that in our city education has led to
fewer juvenile bite cases than those with adult victims.

Goals and Objectives
The Department of Animal Care and Control carries out public safety and service tasks. Animal Care &
Control staff protect citizens from threatening animals, enforce animal related laws, protect the city's
animal population and educate the public regarding safety, the surplus animal problem and the humane
care and treatment of animals.

Animal Handling Equipment: This equipment is safety and care related. These items are purchased annually to replace worn and broken equipment used by Animal
Control Officers in the field and by Animal Care Specialists in the building.
Raccoon rabies:
The Animal Care & Control Department continues to monitor the movement of raccoon rabies from the east. The epidemic has reached Ohio but it is currently
contained to a three county area in Ohio. There is a multi-million dollar oral vaccine baiting program now being conducted by Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and
Tennessee. We are not currently threatened by the arrival of raccoon rabies but it is difficult to estimate it's movement as there are so many variables, including the
baiting program. The potential financial impact on the city has not been addressed in this CIP or proposed operating budgets as original time-frame estimates of the
arrival of the disease have come and gone. Rabies has proven to be an extremely expensive disease to combat from both the animal and human health perspectives.

The Gift of Fostering
Every animal deserves a chance – a chance for
a wonderful family to love and cherish them, a
chance to grow and become a family friend that will
remain in our memories forever. That is the “Gift of
Fostering” that is given by volunteer foster families
every day at Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control.
In the state of Indiana, an animal must be at least
eight weeks of age to be legally adopted from a
shelter or rescue, or sold by a breeder or pet store.
Many animals come into our shelter between four
and seven weeks of age in need of additional time to
grow. Some animals are dropped off because they
are ill or injured and need special attention before
they can become a member of an adoptive family.
These are the special circumstances that occur on a
daily basis in every animal shelter across the nation.

“It’s like having new babies of your very
own and watching them as they grow – it’s
always hard to bring them back.”
Susan Marqueling, volunteer

Here at Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control, we are fortunate enough to work with more than
a dozen volunteers who are trained in the special care these animals need and deserve to
become wonderful family pets. Our foster families open up their own homes to these animals
in need; Animal Care & Control gives them all of the supplies needed to make these animals
comfortable. We supply their food, treats, toys, litter, bedding, puppy pads, newspaper and
more. Many of the supplies we use are donated from pet lovers in our community. The foster
volunteer provides all the love and attention, as well as a safety-proof space to keep their
foster animals during their stay. In talking with one of our foster parents about the joys she
gets from fostering the many litters of puppies that she has cared for in the past three years,
her comments made me realize it definitely takes a special person to open up their home and
family to these amazing animals awaiting adoption.
“When I get them they are babies. I get to cuddle them, they follow me around, and they think
I’m their mom. I get to take care of their illnesses and get them all better. I get to watch them
sleep all on top of each other (soooo cute!) and I get to introduce them to friends, neighbors
and co-workers, and they get some cuddle time, too. But when it’s time to go back, they
have grown into toddlers. Toddlers that need to be trained and learn manners. I don’t want
that job! Others are better at that. So I get to do what I love and the puppies and FWACC
just happens to benefit, also. I learn something new with every foster. I learn about breeds
or how to make things easier for clean-up or how to give medicine or what type of water bowl
is best. It keeps me active and learning. And taking care of puppies is a very active activity!
I think it teaches my kids that hard work and fun can go hand-in-hand.”

From the Director
Teaming Up to Save Money
and Animals’ Lives
at the Same Time
Several years ago we began investigating the
possibility of adding mobile computers to our
officer’s vehicles. The gains are immense for
both animals and citizens when we can put data
at the fingertips of the officers. Animals wearing
identification that is registered with our department
Belinda Lewis, Executive
Director, and her adopted
can receive a trip straight home. We do not want
puppy Jinks
these pets to have to come into our building
anymore than the pet owner does. Currently, this
is an opportunity only when a dispatcher is available in the office. It is rarely
possible at night or on the weekends. Officer safety would also be enhanced
by having violator information right in front of them as we share many of our
clientele with the police department.
At this point we are the last public safety or field services department working
out there without this efficiency enhancement on board. Why the hold up?
Times are tight and we have been leaning out our operations budget each
year. Mobile computers simply have not been in the budget and grant dollars
for capital are rare in the animal control profession.
After examining the issue, Chief
Rusty York had an idea. When the
police department mobiles are out
of warranty, why not bring them
over to Animal Care and Control?
The police department’s mobile
support staff embraced the idea,
and their help has been amazing.
The Controllers Office and Chief
Technology Officer assisted with
the ancillary requirements of the
project, and the radio shop jumped
in with the mounting. This was a
team approach that could not have
happened without some remarkable
people and true concern for the
welfare of both animals and their
owners while ever mindful of the
current economic environment.
The monetary savings to the city
are several-fold. The obvious is
the hardware savings realized by
sharing used equipment across
departments. When this building was
continued on page 5...

What You Can Do
Any pet could slip away from
home. Protect them with a city
pet registration tag required for
all cats and dogs living in Fort
Wayne and made available to
county pet owners.
• Keep your address
information current. If you
move, update your file by
calling our business office at
427-1244.
• If you were given a pet from
a previous owner, be sure the
registration tag, personal ID,
and microchip traces to you
and not the former owner. To
update ownership information,
call our office.
• If your cat or dog slips away
from home, search our shelter
right away and file a lost pet
report. A delay can hinder
your chance of being reunited
with your pet.

A Chance for Harley
Harley is a charming black Labrador
retriever that came to our department
in September of 2010 after her
owner left her with a friend and never
returned. Harley was an awesome
dog from the start. Our staff instantly
fell in love playing ball with her and
discovering all the tricks she enjoyed
showing off. She was an easy choice
for our pet adoption program.
Prior to moving her into adoptions
we performed a routine medical
exam and, to our disappointment, we
discovered a mammary tumor. Harley
was such an agreeable dog; we easily
elected to use donation dollars from
our Angel fund to cover her surgery
expenses. We have successfully
removed mammary tumors from past
adoption dogs, so we felt secure
allowing potential adopters to
consider her. As anticipated, Harley
was quickly chosen by a great family
with small children. We seemed to
have reached a happy ending for our
Harley. At least we had hoped.
Days later, Harley was returned. The
family discovered an allergy with one
of the children. To compound our
frustration, we received a lab result
from Harley’s biopsy stating that her
tumor involved a lymph node, which

is a poor prognosis. If I used the
word devastating, I don’t think that
would still describe how the staff
felt when we shared the results of
Harley’s biopsy. We now had Harley
back in our care knowing it was only
a matter of time before we would face
putting her to sleep.
Standing at a cross roads can be
a challenge for any agency. What
resources do we have and how
can we responsibly allocate those
resources to help the animals in our
care? A staff member suggested
that she could try caring for Harley
in a “hospice” status at her home. It
was
a generous offer by a great staff
•
member, but unfortunately her dog
was not accepting of Harley. Fights
ensued and Harley was returned
once again.
Cancer will continue to spread in
Harley. Our doctors feel it could be
a year or less until the cancer will
migrate into her lungs or affect her
central nervous system. If you saw
her today, you would have no idea
this is happening inside her body.
We know the end results are not
positive, but we wanted to share her
story because she means so very
much to us all. Sheltering homeless

animals is always a challenge, but it is
because of your generous donations
that differences are made for animals
that need it most.
We are happy to report that Harley is
still with us today in a hospice home
with our generous friend Tammy
Dereckson. We visit with Harley
and we are happy knowing that her
days are comfortable, loving and
supportive. At some point we will say
our good-byes to Harley, but for now
she lives and she loves.

Hello!
My fiancé and I adopted ‘Iggy’ last fall and we just wanted to give everyone an update. He
is doing great and loves his big brother, Baxter. We actually changed his name to Archie.
Besides the normal puppy chewing, he has done really well and fits right into the family.
Let’s just say that the boys keep
our lives pretty exciting! Archie
will be attending puppy classes
very soon.
We are both so happy to have Archie in our lives!
Thanks for everything!

The Gift of Fostering
...continued from page 1
Our fosters become attached to the many animals they care
for and on special occasions they are fortunate enough to
know what the future holds for their cuddly friends. Marty
LaBarbara, who has fostered more litters of puppies than we
could track during the past 10 years, has one happy ending
that has stayed with her:
“We fostered Wookie in November 2003 – a six-week-old
black terrier mix. We fell in love with her, but she was such a
sweet puppy we decided to give someone else a chance to
adopt; so we took her back. We delivered her to the shelter on
a Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., decided to eat out and come back.
If she wasn’t adopted, she would be ours. When we arrived
back at the shelter we discovered she had been adopted at
6:00 p.m. by a lovely older couple.
To this day Wookie (now called So-Mi) has a wonderful home
with Animal Care & Control Director Belinda Lewis’s aunt,
and we get frequent updates on our little foster baby. When
customers tell me they could never foster because they could
not give the puppies or kitties up, I tell them there are so many
good people who need puppy and kitty love that I am just
babysitting, waiting for them to come in to adopt. Makes the
job a gift of love. Fostering gives you kitty purrs –puppy breath
– and a morning greeting gift of a new day integrated in love,
even though they’re traipsing through litter, wet food, water
and some poo, too. Evening offers quiet cuddles. These little
hearts wrapped in fur are a foster’s gift of care to be passed to
the new adopters.”
-- Marty LaBarbera
We are fortunate to have so many loving volunteers who give of
their time and their hearts to care for these, our special friends.
We are always in need of volunteers (18 years or older) willing
to give of their time. In order to become a foster parent, we
require that our volunteers help with other tasks such as dog
walking, kennel cleaning or cat socializing for a minimum of
90 days prior to becoming a foster parent. This allows the
volunteer time to become acclimated to our environment and
our animal handling rules, as well as learning to deal with the
emotions associated with caring for homeless animals. Please
contact me, Jodi Hamilton, if you wish to become a volunteer
with Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control. The animals can’t
wait to receive your love.
Perhaps one day we will no longer need foster families for
unwanted litters or for injured animals in need of care, but until
that day, we are lucky to have these amazing angels among us
who share their lives, their homes and their hearts.

From the
Director
...continued from page 2
renovated from a church to an animal shelter in
1998, we took animal intake projections to city
council as we discussed square footage. We
were asked to scale back the project as they
did not feel our numbers were accurate and
animal volume would not likely be that high.
Unfortunately, we have already surpassed
our animal handling plan to the year 2020.
The economy and current societal ownership
trends are not accommodated by available
shelter housing space in our community.
The more animals we can get directly back
to owners, the more space we keep open in
the shelter for adoptable pets in need of new
homes! Daily care, cleaning, and feeding all
cost money. Get those pets home!
Efficiencies gained are also broad in this
approach. We currently make between 22
and 24,000 runs annually handling just under
16,000 animals a year. The officers will receive
their runs directly through their computers and
be processing their paperwork as they go.
End of shift paperwork backlogs that result
in overtime should be gone. The dispatchers
will be able to get to the phones with a quicker
turn around as they are not radio dispatching.
The communications call takers who handle
our after-hours and weekend calls will be able
to input the runs directly, bypassing the need
for radio dispatch. Citizens will be saved
the trip into the shelter and so will their pets
providing identification is kept current and
owners are at home to receive their pet.
Our thanks go to all those in the administration
that teamed up to help make this project
happen on a shoestring. Keeping streets safe
and future expansions of the shelter at bay by
keeping animals in their homes is the ultimate
goal for all players.

-- Jodi Hamilton, Volunteer Coordinator

New Citation Process Saves Money and Time
In an effort to reduce the amount of time, money, and
effort it takes to summons citizens to court once they fail
to comply with initial enforcement action, the Enforcement
Division at Animal Care and Control (ACC) and Allen
County Superior Court (ACSC) officials collaborated
to introduce a process that is proving to save time and
reduce cost to the city.
It is always a priority for our enforcement division to use
education with citizens. When a citation is issued, every
effort is given for a citizen to correct the violation to avoid
fines and a court appearance. Prior to April 2011, our
process was lengthy, cumbersome, higher in cost, and
limited in overall effectiveness. We challenged ourselves
to develop a new and improved process. In the past,
when a citizen received a citation, they were given an
initial thirty days to comply with the violation and contact
our department with their information. As contact and
compliance were met, we would void the citation and no
further action was taken. A real win-win for everyone.
If the 30 days lapsed, the citizen was then sent a final
notice letter stating they had an additional 30 days
to comply and contact our department to avoid being
summoned to court. If they complied and made contact
with us prior to their new deadline, we would void the
citation and no further enforcement action was taken.
The cost of the final notice is a first class stamp. We
average at least 20 per week. Once this time frame
lapsed and no contact was made, the citizen was then
summoned to court.
The summons process added more time and cost. It
entails a search of the database to ensure the citizen did
or didn’t comply but failed to contact the agency. Next,
a summons is created, notarized, signed by the City
Attorney, and then packaged as a certified restricted letter
that is delivered to the Post Master location to be sent out
to the citizen. Each letter costs the City $9.45 per mailing.

6

Once the individual has been summoned to court, the
clerks at the Criminal Justice Center are responsible
for entering the data into their court system for the
designated date. Should the individual fail to appear on
their designated court date, which is traditionally another
thirty to forty-five days, they would receive a letter from
the court providing them with a second court date. If the
individual still failed to show to the second court date, the
judge would issue a warrant for their arrest. In 2010, the
total number of cases heard at ACSC was 730. There is
approximately 30 percent that never appear and result in
warrants being issued.
The biggest improvement to our new process is that
our citation now includes a potential court date. The
citizen is still provided with their initial thirty days to reach
compliance of the alleged violation. As long as the citizen
contacts our agency and provides proof, we void the
citation and no further enforcement action is needed. If
the initial thirty days is lapsed, ACC initiates a final notice
letter providing the citizen with fourteen days to show
compliance and have the citation voided. Failure to do so
will result in the citizen automatically being summoned to
the court date that was included on their original citation.
Using the approximate costs above, we are projecting a
savings to the City of at least $8,968 per year by no longer
needing the certified restricted letter process. The original
citation process could take as long as 150 days before the
person was summoned to court. By this time, people had
moved, failed to claim their summons at the USPS, or
complied during the time they were being processed to
their court date. With the new system, the individual is
processed within a 90 day window to potentially avoid any
of the prior problems along with reducing the costs and
manpower to complete the summons process.
In this current day initiative to do more with less, ACC is
striving for efficiency and cost savings. We feel we are on
a great track with our new citation process.

When Raccoons Invade Your Home
Imagine the scare of hearing something creeping around your home in the
early morning hours. That’s precisely what happened with Pam Messman, a
city resident who discovered she had a posse of raccoons throwing a small
party in her kitchen. The raccoons were smart to choose a great food source,
but Pam didn’t toss down a welcome mat for the three wild critters that had
entered from a hole beneath her kitchen sink. Fortunately she knew to call our
department for service. In a case like this, even if our officers have gone home
for the night, we will dispatch an officer to run the call. Our officers who are on
call have take-home vehicles so they can respond quickly to what is considered
a public safety emergency.
Some types of wildlife inside your home put family members at risk. The
normal course of action is to see if the animals can be lured outside. In this
case the raccoons went into hiding, so a live trap was the next best option.
As soon as the raccoons went inside the trap to eat the bait, Pam called us to
return and remove the animals from her home.
We know that raccoons rarely exhibit a fear of people because they are born and
raised in neighborhoods. They have replaced their former nesting places with
attics, crawlspaces, chimney dampers, hot tubs, decks, tool sheds and storm
drains. Dog and cat water bowls, swimming pools and ponds have replaced
water sources such as creeks and springs. Raccoons are nocturnal animals
that roam neighborhoods at night looking for food. They are opportunistic
feeders, dining on insects, fruits, vegetables, acorns, seeds, fish and small
mammals, as well as dog and cat food and garbage left out overnight. Litters
are usually born in April or May and range in size from one to nine, although the
average is four. By mid-June, most young raccoons accompany their mother
on food searches and begin to learn survival skills.

If you are a city resident and a wild animal is inside your home, we can provide
you with a live trap to catch and remove the animal. Wild animals that are creating a nuisance outside your home
are not considered a threat to public safety. They can be handled by calling a nuisance wildlife removal company
or simply removing the conditions that are attracting them to your home.
Keep your chimney capped and secure your trash can lid with a thick rubber strap with hooks on the end. Look for
holes that may give wildlife easy access to your home. For additional information, visit our website at www.fwacc.

Hats off to Area
Veterinary Hopitals
We take our hats off to ten local veterinary hospitals
who have each sold more than 200 pet registration
tags to their clients during the first six months of 2011.
Thanks for all you do!

Dog bite safety
Don’t lose money on costly hospital and doctor bills, lost
wages or even law suits stemming from a preventable
dog bite. Every 40 seconds someone in the U.S. seeks
medical care because of a dog bite and 70 percent of dog
bites occur on the owner’s property.
With a little planning you can avoid being one of the
4.7 million Americans bitten by dogs every year. Keep
everyone safe by reviewing the following safety tips.
AVOID DOG BITES
• Call 427-1244 to report a stray dog in the city
to the shelter.
• Never approach an unfamiliar dog or an injured dog.
The dog may bite out of fear.
• If you can, safety coax a stray dog into a fenced yard
or garage, do not play with the dog or allow children to
pet the dog. Call the shelter for assistance.
• Always allow a dog to see and sniff you first when
meeting someone else’s dog.
DOG OWNERS
• Never leave infants or small children alone with a dog.
• Spay or neuter your dog to reduce territorial behaviors.
• Obey leash laws when walking your dog
in public areas.
• Don’t take dogs to crowded festivals or parades.
• Enroll your dog in an obedience class for socialization.
• Don’t chain your dog for extended periods of time as
chaining increases aggression.

DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL
The Department of Animal Care and Control faces the public health and safety issues involving animals using a
proactive approach. Protection of citizens and animals, animal rescue, and efforts to minimize euthanasia of
unwanted animals through spay/neuter promotion all strongly reflect the neighborhood and community driven origins of
this agency. Local and state legislation is used to address pet overpopulation, responsible pet ownership issues, and
cruelty or violence issues involving animals. The success of the approach would not be possible without positive
community outreach and education.
The ordinance, adopted by City Council in 1982 and amended as recently as 2007, delineates the laws to be enforced
and the responsibilities of the department toward achieving an overall professional and quality program. This
department has been recognized nationally as a leader in the field and employs multiple national instructors in specific
areas of the profession.
The department will continue to provide high levels of service in all areas of animal care and control and continue
enforcement aimed at the protection and assistance of both community residents and animals. We will strive to
increase promotion of responsible animal ownership to combat pet overpopulation and its resulting euthanasia of
animals and negative impact to our neighborhoods caused by animal excesses.

Programming and Initiatives
In review of 2007, we began to stabilize after an increase in demand for field services and animal impoundments
exceeded expectations following the Aboite area annexation. Theoretically, our animal populations should have
increased minimally. We increased our animals handled by 14% to nearly 16,000 animals, and our run volume went
up 19%. While the increases in demand stabilized for us in 2007, we continued to work toward aggressive
programming to address the never ending influx of animals and the risk faced by citizens reference aggressive
animals. The first ever “Community Input Panel” composed of animal and neighborhood representatives was
convened to discuss and draft legislation advancing the handling of dangerous dogs. The Animal Care and Control
Commission also ramped up its fundraising efforts to support the non-tax based programming that our department
pursues. The reason we are able to do so much more for our city than common governmental shelters is seated in our
citizen community involvement.
This budget reflects a maintenance approach to our current programming with plans to work toward expansion of
donor dollar use in our medical, care, and educational areas. We continue to advance our public safety
responsibilities regarding dogs with the application of the new legislation. As we moved into 2008, our staff conducted
the first, annual we hope, “Neuter for a Nickel” in an effort to bring attention to the need for spay/neuter in the
community to minimize euthanasia. With an intake of over 8,000 cats and fewer than 4% reclaimed by owners, the cat
became the focus for this years’ event.
Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control has long been a national leader in the area of government based animal
services. However, the City of Fort Wayne as a community is beginning to stand out as one of those failing in it’s
efforts toward the fight against pet overpopulation and in the prevention of euthanasia of healthy and treatable
animals. What do other communities have that we do not? We do not have a non-profit agency in our community
helping with outreach programming for area pets. The tax based funding and volunteering at a government shelter
cannot meet all the programming needs for this community. We will make an effort in 2008 to work toward
collaborative involvements with interested groups who may share some of those same conclusions to see what
opportunities may lie ahead for our city.

Goals and Objectives
The Department of Animal Care and Control carries out public safety and service tasks. Animal Care & Control staff

Man Convicted for Dog
Bludgeoning
Previously, we shared that our
Department spent a significant
amount of time enhancing its crime
scene response and handling team
in order to equip our staff with the
skills needed to carry a felony cruelty
case to the prosecutor’s office. With
the help of the Fort Wayne Police
Department, we were able to deliver
that training in early 2009. That was
none too soon for an upcoming call
our officers were about to receive.
On June 18th we dispatched animal
control officers to the 700 block of
Third Street for an apparent stabbing
of a dachshund. Upon arrival, our
officers found that Fort Wayne Police
were also called to the scene. The
animal victim, a dachshund named
Oscar was at one address and the alleged perpetrator was being held at another nearby home.
Our officers, Randy Thornton and Trent Hullinger, quickly photographed the dog at the crime
scene location; a back yard on Third Street before transporting the dog to NIVES for emergency
medical care. As officers from both departments spread out and conducted initial interviews, it
appeared that this may have been a “heat of the moment” crime escalating from the perpetrator’s
little girl being bit by the dachshund. While our Enforcement Supervisor was on scene, our Animal
Care Supervisor assisted with the dog and documenting photography during emergency medical
care provided by the veterinary staff at NIVES.
As often happens with advanced investigation, clues did not add up to the complete picture at the
scene. Our officers did an excellent job with their initial interviews, documentation, and evidence
collection. When all parties were brought together the following day, it became apparent that this
was a criminal act, it was premeditated, and there was a lot more work to be done. The dog had
been restrained on a leash in a care takers yard at the time of the bite, the bite to the child was
very minor, and the father of the child proceeded to the caretaker’s yard after the fact, bludgeoning
Oscar with a four sided battle axe!
The advanced training received earlier in the year coupled with the extensive experience of all
those involved proved invaluable. Officers Thornton and Hullinger returned to the crime scene for
further diagramming and documentation in the daylight. That involves measuring distances to
buildings, points of evidence, fences, drives, etc., and reproducing the crime scene in a diagram
format. Photos must support the diagram to be able to tell the whole story, as contained in the
final case summary that gets submitted to the prosecutor.
Their additional interviews included the caretaker, the animal owner’s adult daughter, and the
neighbor involved who had called 911 for emergency response on behalf of Oscar. The perpecontinued on page 4...

From the Director
We began 2009 by debriefing from the late 2008
December ice storm and the need for us to open
an emergency shelter for pets at the coliseum. No
snow melted under our feet though, as we recovered
from that and moved toward some long term goals
that we had set for ourselves earlier in 2008.
Staff improvement and training has to be done in
a Midwest shelter in the winter months after the
holidays. That gives us a three-month window for
staff development annually. We had set a plan in
Belinda Lewis, Executive
Director, and her new adopted
motion to increase the investigative knowledge-base
puppy Jinks
and forensic processing of our crime scenes in our
front line staff, to be able to confidently carry felony
cases directly to the Prosecutor. With the assistance of the Fort Wayne Police
Department, we set up a four day crime scene investigative school specific to
animal cruelty and dog attack cases. Officers were extremely receptive and
we were proud to see them hit the ground running immediately after the school
with some high profile and successful felony prosecutions. The Enforcement
Division’s call volume has gone up; right along with it, so has the quality of their
investigations!
The Animal Care Division not only ramped up their medical and exam training
to accompany the enforcement training, but they simultaneously increased
their basic triage and assessment skills to better evaluate and respond to sick
and injured animals’ needs. The staff manning our phones and dispatch in the
office has also become investigators, as they pull together the initial information
needed by an officer and maintain the organizational flow both on the street
and in the building. They are all a crucial part of the team when it comes to
any field investigation and their interdependence became very apparent this
year as these cases progressed.
Sometimes when it rains it pours and this year was no exception. As the CSI
programming was going strong, we continued to work with other organizations
and the state legislature to address some weaknesses in our state laws. The
cruelty and neglect laws for animals needed immediate attention, while another
long-term goal has been to address the lack of regulation for commercial
breeders, often referred to as puppy mills, in our state. With tireless attention
to the issue by many in our state, and lobbying phone calls from many of our
own volunteers and local citizens, we successfully saw some modernization of
our state laws. This provides a few more tools to our law enforcement officers
to address issues of cruelty and neglect.
On the home front, our economy seemed to be having an impact on the
number of pets released to animal shelters across the state and the country.
We have always been careful not to let an isolated situation become a trend
in reporting and we may still have to question the overall economic impact on
pet relinquishment. In 2008, 25.7% of our pets received were surrendered by
their owners, while that figure actually decreased in 2009 to 23%. With our
overall animal handling down by 603 animals in the dog and cat category, we
may have a stronger dedication to privately owned pets in our community than

I just wanted to
share some photos
of Sandy with you
and your wonderful
staff. My family
and I adopted
Sandy on
Feb 9, 2009
and she has
been a great addition to the family. She runs
right along side me every other morning when
I go for a jog; my wife takes Sandy on walks with
her, and she LOVES the tennis ball. Sandy was 45 pounds
when I picked her up and 8 months later we have finally added 6 pounds to
her Greyhound-looking frame. Best of all, my kids cannot get enough of her.
Again, thanks for the wonderful pet and fantastic experience of adoption.

My little Janie passed away on October 25,
2009 and my heart is still broken. By adopting
this little one-eyed cat, I initially rescued her, but
through our many years together, she rescued
me several times. She was always there for
me during the bad times.  Very shortly after
she passed away, I went to your website to see
about memorials and was so happy to learn
of the memorial plaques.  Actually, I dropped
some no-sew fleece kitty beds off at the shelter
last Wednesday evening and got to see Janie’s
plaque in person. (Allison had sent me some
beautiful photos of it beforehand.) I sat on the
bench near the kitty room, looking at her plaque
and remembering her. She was one-of-a-kind!!!!! It helps to know that
perhaps another kitty will be helped and/or adopted in Janie’s memory.

Saving Grace
Day by day, animals arrive through
the doors of our shelter to receive
whatever level of care we can provide
them through donations.
Some
animals bounce back under the caring
hands of our staff and veterinarians,
while others thrive from the diligent
attention of our volunteers. Others
may be sent to a partner agency for
rehab and to be eventually placed
into a permanent, loving home. We
never take for granted the amazing
work of partner agencies, such as
New Beginnings Shih Tzu & Friends
Rescue, in creating miracles for dogs
on the brink of death.
This past May, Allen County Animal
Control Officer Vinson brought a small
stray dog into our medical triage. The
distressed dog, a four year old Shih
Tzu, was matted, sickly, and suffering
from an advanced skin condition.
Our staff removed as much hair as
possible from the dog to relieve the
constant pulling of matted fur, and
wrapped her in a cozy sweater for
warmth. Her new name would be
Grace.
Next, we placed a call to New
Beginnings Shih Tzu & Friends Rescue,
hoping that a foster home might be
located for a dog that would clearly

need extensive, long-term care. New
Beginnings took up the challenge and
transported Grace to a veterinarian
in Columbus, Ohio for further tests
and evaluation. Her condition was so
grave that she required two weeks of
hospitalization before she could travel
on to an experienced Pennsylvania
foster home.

to stay here permanently. It took Larry
a little longer, but I think in the back of
his mind, he knew Grace was staying,
too. So it is our absolute pleasure to
announce that we have adopted Grace
and she has been given the name of
Grace Lynn Koczka. She shares our
home and spends time with our two
dogs Sophie and Edy. The three of
them can create quite a lot of fun
together. Grace is quite bright and is
learning some basic obedience. She
loves to go for walks and now looks
for our neighbors, so she can get
some pats. She can hear a bag open
from anywhere in the house and waits
patiently and hopefully for us to share
the contents with her. She is a good
dog and willing to share her affection.
Thank you NBSTR and Fort Wayne
Animal Care & Control for rescuing
and helping Grace have the life she
deserves.”

Once Grace was healthy enough to
travel to PA, she was entrusted to
Larry and Suzan, a fantastic foster
family with a special touch for animals
with skin conditions.
According to Suzan, “It didn’t take
long for us to be captured under
Grace’s spell. She was a happy little
girl, even though we knew she didn’t
feel good. The longer she was here,
the more we were falling in love with
her. I knew first that Grace was going

Man Convicted

...continued from cover

trator was called in for interview, advised of his rights, and under Miranda explained fully why he really did not think he had done
anything wrong that night and at the time of the interview with our director, still did not. In fact, his parting statement was that he
“intended to kill the dog”.
Sadly for Oscar, his injuries included multiple punctures, lacerations, bruising, a broken right front leg, broken neck, and extensive
head trauma. The veterinary recommendation that night was to euthanize Oscar to prevent further suffering. X-rays and a thorough exam had provided enough information to know that he was not going to recover from this terribly cruel act. At that time and
over the next few days the veterinarian proceeded with a necropsy, or animal autopsy, and was able to provide advanced reporting
for the case. This process also required photo documentation by our Animal Care Supervisor to assist, document, and maintain
what is called continuity of the evidence. In this case, that was Oscar’s body.
Much of this process is long and tedious for the investigators, the veterinarian, and the supervisory staff pulling together the case
package. The witness statements, the weapon seized as evidence, the supporting documentation of the crime scene, and ultimately the confession of the perpetrator allowed this case to come together in support of criminal charges through the prosecutor’s
office. All their hard work paid off as the man who bludgeoned Oscar, ultimately to his death; plead guilty to the crime of Cruelty
to an Animal, a class D felony. He was sentenced to 1 ½ years in jail and no animal ownership while he remains on probation.
While Oscar did not have a happy ending, we hope the light brought upon animal cruelty by work and results such as this may
serve to prevent future acts of this nature. We’re very proud of the professionalism shown through this case by our staff, who could
not achieve convictions of this nature without the valuable help of the Fort Wayne Police Department, Allen County Prosecutors
Office, and Veterinarians from Northern Indiana Emergency Services (NIVES).

PATCHES GOES TO ITALY
Here at Animal
Care & Control,
we have the joyful
opportunity
of
placing great pets
into
wonderful
homes
on
a
weekly basis, but
it’s rather unusual
for us to find a home for one of our pets
overseas. A number of months ago,
our adoption team received an inquiry
through our help line at adoptionhelp@

cityoffortwayne.org. Cynthia Abbott, a
former resident of Fort Wayne now living
in Italy, wrote to express her interest
in adopting one of our cats. Her note
explained that she frequently returns
to Fort Wayne to visit family and was
hoping to meet and explore possibilities
upon her next trip to the Summit City.
It was such a pleasure to meet Cynthia
and to hear her talk about her two male
cats that she adopted from a farm in
Fort Wayne 13 years prior. One of the
cats had recently passed away and the

remaining was quite lonesome without
his buddy. She met with numerous
animals in our adoption center, finally
selecting a 7-year-old spayed calico
named Patches whose previous owner
could no longer provide for her care.
Now Patches has a new home in Italy
and we smile knowing that Cynthia
chose our shelter to adopt from.
Bene futuro Patches and Cynthia!

previously thought, in spite of job loss. Sadly though, the volume of domestic pets our shelter receives annually would
belie that idea, as other parts of the country who have received involvement from local non-profits in pet overpopulation
efforts have greatly reduced their intakes.
Our adoption and volunteer programs continue to flourish and increase. These two programs are not exclusive of one
another, as so much is happening for our adoption pets that simply would not be possible without our volunteers. We
saw incremental increases over last year, but a five year look at adoptions gives us a whopping 47% increase in pets
going to new homes! Last year’s increase to first- and third-Saturday adoptions along with continued outreach has
been a big factor.
Talking about factors, the continued efforts of our Education Division create new opportunities through our website and
community involvement on a daily basis. Increased fundraising efforts across the department along with an amazing
volume of visitors to our website continue to offer new resources to animals in our care.
I’m blessed to work in a career that I am so passionate about and to work with such amazing co-workers and community
volunteers! With this kind of team, the sky is the limit.

2010 Pet Registration Tags
If your pet’s registration tag has
expired, be sure to visit our shelter or
a veterinary clinic to renew for 2010.
The required city tag is $5 if your cat
or dog has been altered, $100 if it
has not. Senior citizens age 62+ will
receive a complimentary pet registration
tag providing their pet is spayed or
neutered. Lifetime pet registration tags
are available for pets that are both
altered and microchipped. It’s the only
registration your pet will ever need in

Fort Wayne. Lifetime tags are $30 per
pet and only $5 for the altered and
microchipped pet of a senior citizen
(age 62+).
While wearing a pet registration tag
your pet has tremendous protection.
That’s because we are able to trace
the tag at any time day or night, seven
days per week, and notify owners when
the pet has been recovered. Indiana
state law requires that a current rabies

tag be displayed on your dog’s or cat’s
collar as well. It proves vaccine status,
which is important, but don’t use it for
primary identification. It can only be
traced if the veterinary clinic is open.
Pets don’t come with their own GPS
system, so take time to renew their
2010 pet registration tag and attach it
to your pet’s leather, canvas, or nylon
collar. For added protection, purchase
a microchip from your veterinarian.

YOUR WILL

CATS ABOUND IN ALLEN COUNTY

One of the best ways to fight
animal neglect and cruelties

As a person who has already done
much for animals, you may want
to consider ways of providing for
them after your life. More and more
people are finding the satisfaction of
knowing that their vision for a more
humane world and their love for
animals can live on.
Each year Fort Wayne Animal
Care & Control receives sustaining
resources to our Animal Care Fund
through wills and bequests of faithful
animal lovers like you.
The Animal Care Fund is a protected
account administrated by a citizen’s
advisory council called the Animal
Control Commission, to support
all divisions of our department not
covered by tax dollars. Some gifts
are large bequests; others are
small. Some name the Fort Wayne
Animal Care & Control Animal
Care Fund as a sole beneficiary
of their estate; others designate
a percentage. However, all are
important and all are essential to the
creation of a future which is safe and
accommodating to animals. If you
need additional information, please
call me at 427-1244.

third Saturdays of each month, and on
Wednesday evenings we remain open
until 7 p.m. These extra hours are an
added convenience for customers and
they play a part in boosting the numbers
of cats that can be placed into forever
homes.

Shelters around the country are gearing
up for what we all know to be kitten
season. At Fort Wayne Animal Care
& Control, this is no exception. Just
over 58% of all the cats and kittens
we handle in a year come to us during
the five months between May and
September. At an average arrival rate
of 32 new cats and kittens per day
during these months, we stay hopping
to make as many success stories as
possible. At other times of the year, we
admit an average of 18 cats and kittens
into our building each day, but spring
truly has the most significant impact
as most new kittens are born and
abandoned at that time of year.
Helping us to achieve success is Pet
Supplies Plus located on Coldwater
Road. Their caring staff hosts our offsite adoption center called Kitty City
and they are trained to adopt-out cats
from their location, on evenings and
weekends too! Here’s what their staff
say about Kitty City:
“It has been our pleasure to support
Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control
by having Kitty City Adoption Center in
our store. Being able to help pair cats in
needs with customers able to open their
hearts and homes is a great joy. We
love having the cats here as a reminder
to ourselves and our customers that
there are so many more pets in need
than just what we see. Kitty City’s
presence also helps keep in perspective
the pet overpopulation problem and is
a great way to educate the public to
spay and neuter their pet. Helping these
cats and Fort Wayne Animal Care and
Control is just plain fun too!”
Remember that in addition to our
normal adoption hours, the Animal
Care & Control adoption center opens
from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on the first and

Another avenue for adopting cats and
kittens comes through the success of
our “Better with a Buddy” program.
Whenever a family comes to adopt and
they expresses a desire to give a home
to two felines at the same time, we
can offer to cover the second adoption
fee with a grant provided to us by
Maddie’s fund. This exciting program
helped 139 pairs of kittens leave our
shelter together in 2009. The grant also
supports our “Old Friends” program so
that we can lower the adoption fee to
just $25 for any cat that is five years old
or older.

Won’t you join us in our efforts
to help even more cats and
kittens find loving families this
year? Here’s how:
• Adopt your next cat from Fort
Wayne Animal Care & Control.
• Tell everyone to visit our
website at www.fwacc.org
to search through the many
pictures of available cats that
we post each day.
• Volunteer to be a morning
cleaner at our Kitty City
adoption center, or here at the
shelter
• Volunteer to be a foster home
for underage kittens in need of
extra care.
• Have your cats spayed or
neutered, so they won’t add to
the problem.
• Donate to SNAP to alter the
cat of a family in need.
• Say thank you to the fine
people at Pet Supplies Plus for
allowing us to adopt-out even
more cats and kittens through
their store.

SPOTLIGHT VOLUNTEER - Rebecca Gremaux
How long have you been volunteering?
I have volunteered at FWACC for three years.
What inspired you to volunteer with FWACC?
I was looking for a place that my niece, who wants to become a vet, and
I could volunteer together. She was fourteen at the time and the Explorer
program was the perfect place for her. In addition, I had been excited about
working with dogs since having the experience of training my puppy. It was
so much fun; I just wanted to learn more.
What do you do with the animals or what events have you worked with?
I started rotating dogs and participating in dog wash. When training became available for the Headstart program,
I jumped at the chance to participate. I wanted to learn as much as I could about dog training. I went on to
the welcoming desk and finally to becoming an adoption counselor. The staff, the brown bag dinners, all of the
trainings that Allison Miller and Jodi Hamilton provide are so informative. I love working with the animals and now
I’ve been given the opportunity to work with the Pet Parenting classes. It’s been such an amazing experience for
me to see how much people love their animals. We all have places and situations where our pet’s behavior is
not what we’d like it to be. Some of those situations can be easily resolved with a little knowledge about how to
handle it differently. Some of those challenges require professional help. The Pet Parenting class is a place to
begin the process of figuring it all out. Allison has put together a program that provides some basic information
that we go through. It is my hope that everyone who attends the class leaves feeling like they know their dog a
little better and that they can improve their relationship with their dog.
What do you find to be the most rewarding part of volunteering?
Truthfully, out of all the different experiences and opportunities I’ve had at FWACC I think that participating in
the Neuter for a Nickel program is the most rewarding. It’s so amazing to see the volume of cats that come into
the building at one time. The process has to work like a well oiled machine, and every year it does. I guess it is
knowing that for every animal that is neutered, there are generations of animals that will never have to come into
the other side of adoptions. That’s what makes it so rewarding. It’s also working side by side with staff and other
volunteers to accomplish something we all care so much about.

Neuter for a
Nickel Saves Lives
This year’s Neuter for a Nickel campaign was a
tremendous success as volunteers throughout the
community came together to neuter nearly 800 male
cats during two cold days in February. Representatives
from: (name vet clinics/agencies, ACSPCA, Animal
Care & Control staff and volunteers) took up the task
in an effort to reduce the numbers of unwanted spring
litters destined to be born and abandoned. “We are so
grateful for the donations to this program and for the
generous and caring professionals and volunteers who
rallied together for this important cause,” said Laura
Rowe, animal care supervisor and the driving force
behind the Neuter for a Nickel program. “We see firsthand the sad reality of animals no one wants and we are prepared to do
whatever we can to get pets spayed and neutered.”

How Does FWACC Serve The Community?
Rescue
Our highly-trained field officers rescue many animals from
distress - a dog locked in a car during hot weather, numerous
cats living in the squalid conditions of a hoarder’s home, an
animal hit by a car, strays that roam the streets, or perhaps a
dog that has fallen into a river and is unable to get out. Rescues
are a dramatic part of our work and new challenges emerge
almost daily.
Emergency Stray Animal Transport
Animal Care & Control maintains radio-equipped emergency
ambulance service in Fort Wayne for sick and injured stray
animals. When an injured animal is found wearing traceable
identification, we can often transport the pet to the owner’s
veterinarian to be stabilized until contact is established with the
owner. Other animals are rushed to the shelter for care. We
also work closely with the Fort Wayne Police Department in
matters involving animals – automobile accidents, house fires,
abandonment, etc.
Lost and Found Services
Among the most gratifying services of our department is our
Lost and Found program. We trace identification daily and
notify owners when their lost pet has been recovered. We have
even helped in the recovery and happy return of pets wearing
out-of-state tags or a microchip. Our clerks maintain Found
Reports of animals that are being held in a private home to
assist owners in their search. Our animal care specialists escort
owners through the kennels to identify lost pets. Seeing their
relieved faces makes our day particularly great!
Receiving and Adoptions
There is never a charge for receiving an animal here at Animal
Care & Control. Regardless of the animal’s condition, species,
age, or temperament, we are here to receive animals that have
nowhere else to go. Each animal is examined and those that
are healthy and safe are further temperament tested before
being moved into our adoption center. Adoption animals are
sent to new homes with a spay/neuter surgery, a microchip,
initial distemper combination vaccine, and a donated wellness
exam provided by numerous supportive veterinary clinics.

Education
Only through widespread humane education programs
and animal care materials can we effectively influence and
accomplish our principle purpose of preventing animal cruelty
and neglect. We offer our award-winning cable program KIND
Club Show and supply materials to 496 local K-6 classrooms
each month of the school year. Scout troops and classrooms
tour our facility. Teens grow in their pursuit of service to animals
through our Exploring Animal Careers program. Our education
department maintains our website and works with all media to
consistently remind people of their responsibility to properly
provide for animals.
Pets in the News and on the Web
Adorable adoptable pets are showcased through the generous
support of local media. On radio, listen to the 96.3 Wild Wakeup Show each Monday at 9:30 a.m. Then check out our well
known Pet of the Week seen Mondays at noon on WANE TV
Channel 15. For those who subscribe to Comcast on Demand,
be sure to choose “Get Local” to view our videos of available
pets, or go to our YouTube site: fwacc. Of course, you can
always check out photos of every adoptable pet on our website
at www.fwacc.org and on City TV.
Investigations

• $25 dogs and cats 5 years old or older, as well as
previously owned adult dogs/cats

We regard animal neglect and cruelty with the utmost degree of
concern. Cruelties are investigated by our skilled enforcement
division and are packaged for the Prosecutor’s office. With strong
support from the courts, we prosecute beatings, stabbings,
starvations, failure to provide provisions and veterinary care,
and cases of abandonment. It is the most troubling duty for our
staff, which sees the worst possible torment inflicted by people
on helpless animals.

• $50 ferrets

Volunteer Program

• $10 small birds and rabbits

Staff Donates Time to Help
Grand Bahama’s Animals
As part of the Humane Society of Grand
Bahama’s ongoing spay/neuter program,
seven amazing volunteers made their way
from Indiana and New Mexico to lend a
helping hand to spay/neuter initiatives.
Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control’s own
Animal Care Supervisor Laura Rowe and
Animal Care Specialist Jennifer Cherry
joined Veterinarians Dr. Ray Hudgell, Dr.
Dan Dessauer, Dr. Kim Hamel, and licensed
Two pups awaiting surgery
vet technicians Angie Cherry, and Shaunessy
Nadeau who all took their precious vacation time and paid their own way to the Bahama Islands to
assist the program. They also donated many medicines and supplies needed to perform surgeries
and benefit shelter animals.
In a statement made by HSGB, “We appreciate the selflessness of these incredible people, and
their understanding of our mission. The staff of the HSGB is tired of the endless intake of surplus dogs and cats, and tired of having to make difficult choices that no living being should ever
be forced to make on behalf of another. We know there’s a better way, and intense spay/neuter
combined with education on responsible pet ownership and law enforcement is what’s called for.”
At the end of the week, 112 animals had been spayed or neutered. About half were shelter animals, and half were privately owned animals whose owners would not be able to afford the surgery
privately, or would not bother to have it done. Many shelter animals also received minor surgeries
and treatments that HSGB otherwise would not have been able to afford for them.

Ready...Set...Go!
Walk 2008 gets underway.

Congratulations to all the volunteers
who gave their time and talents to
make a difference for animals in other
parts of the world. And thanks to our
many supporters here at home who
financially support Fort Wayne Animal
Care & Control’s initiatives to spay and
neuter animals in our community. Your
contributions save lives and educate
the public to increase responsible animal ownership. We might sound like a
broken record at times, but perhaps if
we say it enough it will sink in!

Animals 2009!

From the Director
Recently our agency was formally recognized by
the Humane Society of the United States as a
progressive leader among US shelters and for our
unique approach to saving the lives of animals
“outside the governmental box”.
According to
HSUS Indiana State Director Anne Sterling, “Fort
Wayne Animal Care & Control managed by Belinda
Lewis and her team in Fort Wayne should serve as
an inspiration to other animal control departments
looking for ways to expand their services, serve the
community, and save more lives. Under Belinda’s
leadership, Fort Wayne has developed one of the
more progressive, community-friendly animal control
departments in the country.”

Belinda Lewis, Executive
Director, and her new adopted
puppy Jinks

Years ago, more than twenty but no one is counting, I was contacted about the
prospect of coming to Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control. I had been the
director of a small humane society and at the time was the Director of Animal
Control in Evansville. I was not happy and was still looking for that place in
my career to “land”.
In the mid-eighties Fort Wayne had been in turmoil over the shelter but they
were coming out the other side with a positive direction. A citizen’s movement
had forced the city to recognize the importance of a professional and humane
animal control program and they had begun the long and arduous process of
that transformation. Wow! Some cities would not come to this realization until
over a decade later and some still have not to this day. It was easy to say yes
to Fort Wayne. Who would not want to be on the ground floor of an enlightened
change in their own profession!
We have a triad of support here in Fort Wayne that many agencies do
not. We have highly educated staff who are very dedicated, a supportive
administration, and a volunteer base that helps us every day to cover those
areas that are outside that “box”. Animal Care and Control under the humane
ethic was our initial goal but these tiers of support have allowed us to do so
much more. It’s also easy to see it’s not about me, it’s about this enormous
community following we have that have recognized the importance of a society
that respects the care of their animals and expect that in this City.
The citizen’s movement may have started the ball rolling but the momentum
had to come from within. We have focused on using service and education
to create opportunities for long term successes in our daily contacts made
by Animal Control Officers, escalating to law enforcement as needed rather
than as an initial response. Our city administration has never met me with a
negative when requesting permission to start new and different programming!
The catch to that is always going to be money.
There are requirements of any community to meet their obligations surrounding
public health and safety with regards to animals. Usually that is viewed as the

Dear friends, the “silent” army, and those I
have never even met,
Well, here we are in a special
session and it is giving me the time
to actually sit down and send all of
you wonderful people that coached
me, guided me, encouraged me and
supported me during this wild and crazy
session a love letter, and I do love you all.
I will not use any names and I will not call anyone out specifically for
fear of leaving anyone out, but I was only the “town crier”. You were
the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps...and you kicked butt!!!
This one will go down in history as the “Puppy Mill” session. It was
just about all anyone spoke about during our time in Indianapolis and
after. We made a difference in the lives of hundreds, if not thousands
of our four-legged friends. I can’t and will never be able to thank
all of you for phone calls, emails, rallies, letters, time, testimony in
committees, and energy. You have educated me, consoled me, given
advice, and let me cry when I needed to.
I want you all on my side whatever the issue, whatever the fight. Your
passion and fearlessness was contagious and got me through some
pretty tough times.
We didn’t get everything we wanted, but there were many times I
didn’t think we were going to get what we did. We need to be vigilant,
keep up the fight, and stay committed to the long-term goals.
Dear friends...never, ever,
ever will I be able to thank you
enough...you are the everyday-inthe-trenches heroes and heroines,
and I am proud, proud, proud to
serve you!!!
Sincerely,
Representative Linda Lawson

Unprecedented National Campaign to
Spotlight Shelter Adoptions
entire Animal Welfare Movement,
is going to change that.

Photo by Judy Evancho

We’ve all read the reports: Around
8 million dogs and cats enter
shelters and rescue groups every
year, and an estimated 3 million
healthy and treatable pets never
find a loving home.
The Shelter Pet Project (SPP),
a national Ad Council campaign
sponsored by Maddie’s Fund® and
The Humane Society of the United
States in partnership with the

Developed pro bono by Draftfcb
Chicago, and with an annual
commercial value of tens of millions
of dollars, the campaign will utilize
TV, print, radio, and outdoor public
service advertising, along with an
interactive website, to encourage
millions of people who are looking
for a companion animal to make
shelter and rescue dogs and cats
their first choice for adoption.
One hurdle that all shelters face
is negative perceptions. Some
people worry that shelter pets come
with health problems or behavior
issues. Others fear that making
a trip to the local shelter will be
too depressing or overwhelming
for their family. The Shelter Pet
Project’s national campaign will
combat these misperceptions and
you can help here in Fort Wayne.
If you have adopted a pet from

We’re Finding Homes for Pets!
Who can resist a fluffy puppy face or an adorable kitten purr? Well, it
seems that many people here in Fort Wayne can’t resist!
Thanks to an overwhelming community support, our Pet Adoption
Center has been busy, busy, busy! Between January and June of this
year, our Pet Adoption Center found homes for 1,321 pets and had over
11,000 visitors. Some visitors fell in love with our frisky kittens, and
others fell in love with our friendly dogs.
Others found the new companionship of a cheerful bird or a beautiful
bunny, while others keep checking back and watching for the perfect
match for their family. We feel proud knowing that the community of Fort
Wayne supports our efforts to find loving homes for our homeless pets.
Remember, adoption is the best option!i

ours or any shelter, be sure to
share your story of love and
joy with others. Be a voice that
encourages people to adopt.
Take a few minutes to upload a
picture of your adopted pet to local
media websites such as www.
journalgazette.net/critters, which
is the pet section of the Journal
Gazette website. Let people know
that a shelter is the first and best
place to find a new four-legged
friend.
For more information on the Shelter
Pet Project campaign, go to http://
www.theshelterpetproject.org and
sign up to receive regular updates.
The campaign was launched in
August of 2009 and marks the
first time in its more than 60-year
history that the Ad Council has
taken on an animal welfare cause.
Join us in spreading the word that
pets from Fort Wayne Animal Care
& Control are great!

Returning Lost Pets Home
If you have lost a pet, then include Fort Wayne Animal Care
& Control in your search. Lost pets arrive daily, so your pet
could be here waiting. To claim your pet, you’ll need your
driver’s license or picture ID. That helps to ensure that
our department is returning pets only to their legal owner.
Bringing a picture of your pet or records of your pet’s
vaccinations can help verify legal ownership.
The first time you claim your lost pet from the shelter, the fee
is minimal. For those animals that are frequent customers
to the lost and found, the fee does go up. Call ahead if you
have questions at 427-1244. A check, credit card or cash
will be accepted.
All dogs and cats within the City of Fort Wayne are required
to wear a city pet registration tag for identification. If your
pet has been spayed or neutered, you’ll be able to purchase the $5 pet registration tag when you claim your
pet. Any animal that comes into the shelter without a current pet registration (or traceable tag if a resident of
Allen County living outside the city) will be required to be microchipped upon redemption. For those dogs or
cats that are not altered or are not currently vaccinated against rabies, the owner is allowed 30-days to get
everything needed for their dog or cat.
Remember, your pet is counting on you to find him and your search can be made much easier by starting at
Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control!

need to investigate cruelty and neglect, perform rescues, pick up strays, handle bite cases, and shelter animals. Pet
overpopulation control comes with that but is often a last in the area of financing. When it comes to medical care,
matchmaking for adoption animals, educating the public with regards to these issues, preventive health care in the
shelter, and so on; many governments simply cannot justify the funding. There are many demands upon the taxpayer
and city administrators have to balance those obligations.
Here in Fort Wayne we have met some of those challenges with the use of fund-raising, grant writing opportunities
specific to animals, and with volunteers; another reason we have been identified as unique in this field. Our fund
raising touches all that is important to animals in our community that is not tax base funded. For example, just having
volunteers here requires a structured program. Then we can launch forward into all the wonderful things that happen
here solely due to citizen support through volunteering. They welcome our adoption customers; assist with lost and
found pets and in our surgical suite. We have volunteers performing as adoption counselors, send home counselors,
maintenance of our off-site adoption locations, and so much more.
If you have ever had the opportunity to attend one of our community events, there is just a couple staff there. Everyone
else is a volunteer, helping us to keep the money coming in that provides the special attention for animals and efforts
in adoptions that we’re able to provide with their help.
Who could know we would have morphed so strongly in the last twenty years? It was easy to say yes then and I am
extremely proud to be part of this environment of community support now.

Dogs and cats are more than pets—
they’re family. And just like any other
member of the family, they deserve to
be cared for and protected. That’s why
we now offer a First Aid class here at the
shelter every six to eight weeks, designed
just for pet owners. The class takes four
hours to complete and is limited to a small
group of people to allow time for hands-on
bandaging and CPR training using animal
manikins.
Registered veterinary technician Beth Tropp gears her instruction toward dog
owners, but takes time to include plenty of cat care information and stresses
prevention. Students pay $55 for the class to receive a Dog First Aid manual and
DVD set and the Pet First Aid Completion Card. A Cat First Aid manual and DVD
set can be purchased for an additional $17.
Join Animal Care & Control for this American Red Cross sanctioned class and
learn critical First Aid to keep your dog healthy and safe.   Build First Aid skills
and receive the guidance needed for emergency situations until veterinary care
is available. Call 260-427-5508 for the next available class or go to our website

SPOTLIGHT VOLUNTEER
Donna Ehinger

Emilie Beard
Benjamin Franklin
questioned, “Dost
thou love life?
Then waste not
time; for time is
the stuff that life is
made of.”

Donna Ehinger
certainly
does
not consider her
10-12 hours per week volunteering at Fort Wayne
Animal Care & Control a “waste of time”.
Donna grew up on a dairy farm and learned compassion for animals from her parents. Her father often
brought home baby raccoons, and even baby skunks,
for Donna’s mother to nurture.
A stay-at-home mom, Donna spent years volunteering at her children’s schools. As a matter of fact, she
was there so often that many people thought she was
one of the teachers. Donna also took care of her
aunt for fifteen years, the last five of which her aunt
suffered from Alzheimers. With her children off to
college, Donna determined to volunteer at something
she loved.
She had read an article in the newspaper about
the shelter. She was impressed by the fact that no
homeless animal is turned away from Animal Care
& Control. Reading about the tenderness with which
the animals are treated by the staff touched her. She
wanted to be a part of it.

The adoption lobby
at Fort Wayne Animal
Care & Control bustles
with activity
throughout the week
and during our twice a
month Saturday adoption events.
Each
person who visits the
shelter has their own
story, their own special
circumstances, and, most often, their own idea of the
perfect pet for them.
Emilie Beard, a volunteer at Animal Care & Control for
three years, welcomes the many visitors to the shelter. A warm and welcoming smile is easy for Emilie.
She chose to volunteer at the shelter because she
has had a life-long love for animals. Emilie had been
a visitor to the shelter herself when she adopted Boo
and Roo, her two kittens. “I adopted here and realized what a terrific shelter this is and saw their need
for help.”
Besides working the welcome desk, Emilie has progressed to the demanding function of adoption counselor. When asked what “makes your day” at Animal
Care & Control, Emilie responded, “To make that
perfect match-up of animal to adoptor.”
It’s that “perfect match-up” Emilie strives for that gives
the homeless animal the opportunity for success with
the adoptor and, therefore, the opportunity for a permanent home and family.

Donna now performs an important function by assisting the veterinarian with the spay and neuter surgeries each Tuesday. On Thursday afternoons, she can
be found at the shelter’s welcome desk.

Emilie takes her work home with her. Literally! Over
the last three years, she has fostered at least twelve
litters of kittens, which equates to about 40 or more
kittens.

“It’s both the animals and the people,” Donna explains.
She loves seeing the animals get adopted, and she
really enjoys being around people who understand
her passion; people who have that same level of love
for animals. “When my father died, animals became
my source of comfort.”

Fostering is necessary if the kitten weighs less than 2
¼ lbs. It often takes two to four weeks to accomplish
the weight required for the kitten to be in the adoption
program, but Emilie keeps them as long as it takes.
She says, “It’s wonderful to see them go from frightened little things to bouncing puff balls.”

Donna lives with her husband, two dogs and four cats.
Obviously, animals remain a source of comfort.

After a busy career in the commercial loan business
and raising a son, Emilie is not resting on her laurels.
She has people to see, places to go, and…..deserving, sentient beings to place in loving arms.

Local Dog Wins Fame and Fortune
Well, not necessarily fortune.
Okay, not even fame.
But Boo Radley, a resident of Three Rivers North right
here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, has won SOMETHING.
Boo Radley, an albino Pekingese, is a shelter dog and
proud of it. He was adopted from Fort Wayne Animal
Care & Control when about three months old. He looks
out at the world through pale blue eyes, sniffs food,
friend and foe through a pastel pink nose, and has a
wobbly gait due to a neurological problem. He frequents
Animal Care & Control, often incorporating himself into
the safety programs held for scouts and school children.
He is a regular at Headwaters Park in his free time.
Boo Radley’s picture was chosen as a winner in the
Xerox Free Color Printers Adoptable Animals Calendar
Contest. He also won $50.00, which was donated to the
shelter. Although the grand prize went to a Blueberry of
Fountain Hills, Boo takes great pride in representing Fort
Wayne Animal Care & Control on the calendar. In a letter

Become Family!

from Xerox, their marketing manager stated:
“The many photos and pictures we received warmed our
hearts, yet illustrated the prevalence of homeless animals. Your dedication to animal welfare and finding them
forever homes is appreciated by many!”
Boo Radley plans to remain in Fort Wayne in spite of his
notoriety.

SPRING 2012

The Joy of Special People
Have you ever woken up in the morning and wished
you had just one hour a week where you could
disconnect from the hustle and bustle, enjoy a walk
in the sunshine, or talk to a great listener who didn’t
offer advice? Maybe spend time with a friend who
loves running around in circles, chases a ball or just
walks quietly beside you? At Fort Wayne Animal
Care & Control, a chosen few have decided to do
just that!
With well over a dozen volunteers leading the pack,
we have been able to transform our adoption area
into a hub of never-ending interaction between our
adoption animals and potential adopters, all through
our volunteer dog walking program! Whatever
the weather, our dogs need exercise and mental
stimulation to stay happy, healthy and safe while
they wait for their loving forever homes.
The dog walker volunteer program was born out
of necessity. Our kennel environment is pleasant,
well-lit, and comfortable. One visit and you’ll agree,
but there had to be more too it. What could we do to
help the adoption dogs in our care become “happier”
dogs while they wait for adoptive families to call their
own? A walk a day can make an anxious barking
dog into a peaceful resting dog and all it takes is
YOU and one hour a week! Since our dog walking
program began, we have noticed a significant drop in
basic behavior issues such as jumping and barking.

A few short years ago, the adoption program
was able to save enough donation dollars for the
amazing addition of our Pooch Playground. This
extremely large, fenced-in area enables our dog
walkers to walk our dogs outside and take them into
an enclosed area to really get some energy burned
off. The addition to our Pooch Playground has been
a true joy! Volunteers and dogs can now spend their
time playing fetch, running around or just sitting
underneath a shade tree and enjoying one another’s
company.

From the Director
Although we are feverishly working on some new
projects, I wanted to write this note and take a
minute to reflect on the amazing accomplishments
from our past year. We began the year with
further support from our Animal Care and Control
Commission. With their help, we were able to fund
special programming in our adoption area this year,
including our Feline Frenzy and our Ambassador
Pit Bull Program. (Take a look at our year-end
adoption report for more details about these exciting
programs.) Community outreach has exploded with
Belinda Lewis, Executive
the incredible level of support our volunteers bring
Director, and her adopted
to this agency. Adoption appearances about town
puppy Jinks
with the Whisker Wag’n, at the ballet, Mad Ants,
and Tin Caps could never happen without their help.
Our enforcement division continues to work toward ensuring the welfare of
our community’s animals and the safety and livability of our neighborhoods.
Teamwork with the Fort Wayne Police Department and fantastic support from
the Allen County Prosecutors Office has increased the ability of this agency to
do its utmost when it comes to animal neglect and cruelty. Domestic violence
-related animal cruelty is consistently worked as a felony violation in Fort Wayne
and advanced animal neglect or cruelty is not tolerated at any level in our
criminal justice system. Sixty six cases of cruelty or neglect were heard in the
Allen County court system this year using either state laws or local ordinances.
Our ultimate goal is resolution through education for long-term gain, but we
are fortunate in Fort Wayne to have the overall support of the courts when the
educational approach fails or the crime is just too heinous. On a happier note,
our installation of recycled computers into the officers’ vans has increased the
direct return of pets to owners in the field by an incredible 241%. If pets are
wearing identification, it qualifies them for a direct ticket home, keeps the pet and
owner less stressed, and keeps kennel space open for adoptable animals in our
building.
As the officers continue to maintain safety in the community regarding animal
bites, they receive special assistance from our education department. Fort
Wayne has been identified as having a reverse statistic when it comes to animal
bites and children. While most communities across the U.S. see more children
bitten than adults, we see the opposite here. In 2011, 196 juveniles were bitten
by animals while 404 adults were injured from animal bites. Of our most severe
cases, 10 of our victims were adults and four were juveniles. Furthermore, the
majority of bites in most communities happen from animals running loose. In
Fort Wayne, just 26% of our bites occurred from animals that were not legally
restrained at the time of the bite.
In the area of community relations and education we saw an astonishing 425
hours of cable broadcast time including our Kind Club Show and specialized
video productions. Videos for adoptions and education aired on specialty venues
such as Comcast Pets on Demand, City TV, and FWCS-LTV. Our website is
nationally recognized and exceeded 548,000 “hits” in 2011! Exposure of our
adoption pets and education messages through all these media portals ensures
the word gets out.

Neuter for a Nickel News
a note from Laura Rowe, Animal Care Supervisor

Every year in the weeks before the Neuter for a Nickel event, I think repeatedly to myself, why in the world am I doing
this? After the event, the staff is exhausted, our building smells like cat pee, there is cat fur everywhere, and I find
myself continually sneezing for several days. Again, I wonder what I am possibly thinking...
Then I take my morning walk through the building and enter our cat area which houses hundreds of cats, a place where
every day I have to make tough decisions. During those moments, Neuter for a Nickel pops into my head and I know
without a doubt why this important event exists.
Although I may be the person who makes the decisions and takes the heat when things go wrong during Neuter for
a Nickel, we wouldn’t have made it to the five-year mark without each and every volunteer. Every single person who
helps out is essential. This year we had some very brave volunteers at 6:30 in the morning standing in 20 degree
weather, all for Neuter for a Nickel and keeping the parking lot under control. It was amazing how much smoother
things went when the parking lot was under control.
The cat runners this year got their workout throughout the day. I am not sure how many calories you burn per hour
carrying cats but it sure seemed like a lot. The send home areas went smoother than ever before and surgery was
fast and efficient.
Of course, every year, a sprinkle of crazy comes through Neuter for a Nickel in one way or another. Whether it
is swapping cats into the wrong carriers, cats getting loose in the parking lot, or simply people who can’t control
themselves in an adult-like manner, it is all in the name of neutering!
My deepest thanks to the to all of you, nearly 150 volunteers, for supporting Neuter for a Nickel year after year.
Laura
P.S. Our total count for neuters: 789!

Kahlua (Jenny)
Just wanted to let you know that Kahlua (Jenny) is
doing great! Such a little bundle of energy and
so loving. She will be playing and then come to
me and rub all over me and want to be cuddled
and then it’s back to play again. One of her
favorite toys right now is this red octopus.
She did really great at the vet’s last night and
everyone thought she was so adorable and she is! She
is a non-stop purring machine and at the vet’s, they had to put an alcohol-soaked cotton ball in front of her nose to
get her to stop purring long enough to listen to her heart! She was a little lethargic this morning from the shot she got,
but she is back up to full speed this afternoon. Thank you for such a great little kitty!

Odie
Almost a week ago my boyfriend and I adopted “Odie.” He’s adjusting well
and enjoys living at our apartment. There are a lot of other dogs living at the
apartment complex too, and he loves the fact he gets to play with them when
we go out for walks!! Just wanted to say thank you for helping me adopt my
new best friend.

Let’s Get Ready to Waste Away
Although we were fortunate to not have as much snow this
winter, the cold temperatures often lessen our interest in
clearing pet waste from our lawns. Now that spring is here
we will have plenty of rain that could wash pet waste from
our yards and into storm drains. That might sound rather
convenient, but pet waste, along with the bacteria and other
pollutants that it carries, flows with the stormwater directly
into our streams, ponds, lakes and rivers without first being
treated. Storm water starts off relatively free of pollutants,
but as it flows over the landscape it picks up substances
from our roads, parking lots and, of course, your dog’s lawn
and carries these substances into our streams and lakes.
An issue of great concern is that animal waste decomposes
once it enters a water body and it depletes the oxygen
that fish and other aquatic life need to live. Nutrients from
decomposed pet waste also contribute to the growth of
algae that further reduces oxygen levels. The high bacteria
levels of animal waste make our waterways unsafe for
swimming or fishing.

By city ordinance, every pet owner is responsible for
cleaning up after the pets they own. Remove pet waste
before it can attract flies or cause unpleasant odors. Pick
up pet waste from public parks, areas where children
play, from easements and other common areas. It’s just
common courtesy.
Here are three quick tips to waste away.
1. Always carry a bag with you when you walk your dogs.
Biodegradable bags are great and they can be attached
to the handle of your dog’s leash with a rubber band.
2. Always pick up pet waste by putting the bag over your
hand to use as a glove. Pick up the waste, turn the bag
inside out and secure the bag shut.
3. Dispose of pet waste by burying it or putting it into the
trash. It can also be flushed without the bag.

National Protection
Agency Awards
Grant to FWACC

From the
Director

You can only imagine our excitement when we received the
announcement that our shelter was one of five animal welfare and
law enforcement agencies in the country chosen to receive a grant
of $8,000 from a national animal welfare organization, the ASPCA®
(The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals®).
The grant to Fort Wayne will fund supplemental equipment to our
enforcement division for animal cruelty crime scene investigations.

All these exciting things we do are really
designed around one ultimate theme,
one common thread: saving the lives of
unwanted animals, preventing the birth of
unwanted pets, and ensuring the welfare
of citizens and the animals currently owned
in our community. We have a magnificent,
caring staff and an unsurpassed cadre of
volunteers working at these tasks every
single day. Sadly, the economy seems to
be impacting pet retention, along with the
pursuit of spaying and neutering of pets. We
look to the near future for new opportunities
to team with other area organizations to
address some of these worries so we can
do our best for both the pets and the people
here in the Fort.

As expressed by our Deputy Director Amy Jo Sites, “The
generosity of this national organization headquartered in New York
allows us to enhance our investigative skills and to further achieve
our mission for prevention of animal neglect and cruelty.”
“Through these grants, the ASPCA is able to empower agencies
to investigate and bring justice for animal cruelty victims in
their communities,” added Allison Cardona, grants officer for
the ASPCA’s Field Investigations and Response team. “It’s
encouraging to see that more groups such as Fort Wayne Animal
Care and Control are recognizing the importance of addressing
animal cruelty and allocating resources to further advance their
capabilities in responding to incidents on a local level.”

...continued from page 2

Animal Care and Control officers respond to a multitude of calls
within the city every day. In 2011, officers completed 22,660
total calls for service. Of that total, 6,262 were investigations that
included concerns of cruelty, neglect, or animal bites.

WISH LIST:

Examples of the type of equipment purchased include crime scene
photography scales, blood detection equipment, laser measuring
devices, a cadaver storage refrigerator, evidence storage and
other items.

If you are looking for a worthy service project
for a club or if you are a pet lover willing to
lend a hand, the following list of items is much
needed to help us care for more than 15,700
animals each year.

The supplies and equipment will allow our department to further
advance our case quality for animal cruelty investigations. We are
extremely grateful to the ASPCA® for helping us fulfill our mission
with funding that goes beyond the reach of our departmental
budget.
About the ASPCA®
Founded in 1866, the ASPCA® (The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals®) is the first humane organization established in the Americas and serves
as the nation’s leading voice for animal welfare. One million supporters strong, the
ASPCA’s mission is to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals
throughout the United States. As a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, the ASPCA is
a national leader in the areas of anti-cruelty, community outreach and animal health
services. The ASPCA, which is headquartered in New York City, offers a wide range of
programs, including a mobile clinic outreach initiative, its own humane law enforcement
team, and a groundbreaking veterinary forensics team and mobile animal CSI unit. For

Shelter Initiative
Homes More Rabbits
Rabbits have not actually replaced the Labrador Retriever as
America’s most popular pet. But their popularity as household
pets is definitely on the rise. Rabbits are active, social animals
which are fun to watch, and they enjoy spending time around their
owners. They can also be trained to use a litter box.
Animal Care & Control’s total small animal intake was 550 in 2011.
Rabbits made up at least 45% of that number while guinea pigs,
hamsters, and pet rats were among the others we received. The
trend reflects the average rabbit intake of 250 plus per year to our
department.

Dr. Jen Stresman, DVM with Mrs. Peabody

As part of Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control’s continued effort to save lives, we began research on the protocols of
spaying and neutering rabbits. Besides the obvious benefit of reducing unwanted litters, the behavioral issues are
greatly improved. It curbs the male rabbits’ urge to spray and mark their territory, and it alleviates female aggression.
The spayed or neutered rabbit is less likely to develop testicular or ovarian tumors and, therefore, adds to the lifespan
of these wonderful little creatures.
Specific surgical equipment is needed to accommodate the spay/neuter procedure on small animals. Laura Rowe,
Animal Care Supervisor, secured that necessary equipment this past March, so we are now able to spay or neuter
every adoptable rabbit.
This new initiative will greatly improve a rabbit’s chance of being adopted. Adopters will not have the concern or
expense of having the spay/neuter procedure done on their own. Depending on the type of rabbit, their life expectancy
ranges from five to 15 years. With medical
and behavioral issues eliminated, the
rabbit has a better chance of remaining in
the same home for its lifetime.
Rescue groups will also be more likely to
accept rabbits from us because they will
be more placeable with people who want
to share their home with a bouncy bundle
of fur.
Jessica Hill, Animal Care Specialist, and
a very knowledgeable person about ‘all
creatures small’ is very pleased with the
new program launch.
“It will make us more competitive in the
rabbit market. When people buy rabbits
from pet stores it encourages commercial
breeding. The spaying and neutering of
rabbits is a movement of our agency as a
whole to do better by small animals with
the benefit going to the adopter.”
Animal Care & Control’s adoption fee for
rabbits will remain just $10.00.

Experience is a Wonderful Thing
Once a family makes the decision to adopt a dog, they naturally start looking at
either puppies or younger adult dogs. Let’s face it. Puppies steal the show and
young adult dogs look like the very solution to forcing us off the couch and into
the park for daily walks. Plus, it’s logical to want to adopt a canine friend that will
be with us for as long as possible, which is never long enough.
Here at Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control, not every dog falls into the category
of puppy or adolescent. Barney, a nine-year-old Beagle lost his home when his
owner moved into an assisted living center. Without any other family members to
move in with, Barney came here. He was charming and ever so cuddly. He was
active and definitely deserving of a second family for whom he could display his
loyalty.
Giorgio, a 10-year-old Lhasa-Apso didn’t arrive looking fashionable, but after a
shower and a shave and a new collar he looked like a new man. He stole our
hearts and we knew it wouldn’t be long before he would find his perfect match,
even at a distinguished age.
So what special quality must one have to open their heart and home to a senior
animal? I would venture to call it benevolence. Yes, it still exists and we see it
every time someone is bighearted enough to choose a dog or a cat of advanced
age. We smile when someone says yes to the old dog that needs multiple teeth
pulled because dental care was never provided. Someone is willing to adopt
a senior dog with a heart murmur and someone else falls in love with the gray
muzzle of an old friend with arthritic hips.
These generous individuals know that they won’t have 15 years of memories
with their adopted friend, but they seem to look beyond their own loss to give the
best years ever to a deserving senior. These are people who have learned that
experience is a wonderful thing. Here is one such adoption letter that we would
like to share.
Here is a picture of 10-year-old Eli that I adopted last Friday afternoon. He and
the other two dogs are getting along so well – after the first afternoon of nerves
and sniffing parts, they were old friends.
They eat side-by-side; no growls or fights about food. Lucky the Rat Terrier lunged
once at Eli, and Eli let him know that was not kosher. No repeat of that behavior.
In fact, Lucky had to come and get some comfort from me, as his feelings were
rather hurt by the incident.

Why Adopt a
Senior Pet?
A senior pet’s personality is
clear, so you’ll know if it’s
the right one for your entire
family.
A senior pet has a greater
attention span made for
training.
A senior pet may have
house manners and know
some commands.
A senior pet may already
be housetrained.
With a senior pet, you’ll
know exactly how much
size you’re getting.
A senior pet is often happy
to hang out with you, rather
than find mischief.
A senior pet makes a great
napping buddy.
A senior pet knows that
difference between chew
toys and shoes.

Eli was described as independent – not really a lap dog, they didn’t think he’d be
playing with toys much due to his age. All of this has been proven untrue in the
last couple of days. He follows me everywhere (right behind Biggs, our adopted
Shih-tzu); has to sit right next to me or by my feet, if not in my lap; has taken
to playing with toys with abandon, sore teeth and all. Screams with delight and
tries to get me to pick him up when I first get home. He gets frisky, barks at the
squirrels, chases the cat and generally follows the other dogs around to see what
the three of them can get into – when he is not following me around.
He starts out the night on the end of my bed, and then opts for the doggie bed
a little later – he does not appear to want any part of the crate. He is well on his
way to being completely spoiled rotten. He does seem to have a bit of separation
anxiety when I leave for work, but the other dogs will help him with that.

Wildlife – To Help or Not to Help
Sometimes we receive wildlife brought to our department by concerned citizens. We encourage people to call us
first before removing baby wildlife from a nest. Oftentimes babies are old enough to be on their own and a parent
is nearby, although out of sight. By calling our department first, we can help determine if the babies are better left
where they are or if indeed they need assistance. As spring babies become a common sight please remember to
call us before you move wildlife from an area. Equally important is
the reminder not to take wildlife into your home.
Of course, there are times when wildlife truly does need help.
Officer Stacy Miller was dispatched to a home where the owner
had trapped a neighborhood squirrel that was a frequent visitor to
his wildlife feeding station. He trapped the squirrel because it had
a plastic ring stuck around its neck. The home owner requested
that we bring Mr. Squirrel back to his home if possible and as long
as everything was ok with the squirrel.
We could easily see that this squirrel was fine and feisty, so Dr. Jen
Stresman, Officer Miller and Animal Care Supervisor Laura Rowe
proceeded to anesthetize the squirrel to safely remove the ring.
Once Mr. Squirrel was asleep, our staff was able to cut and remove
the ring. Mr. Squirrel has been returned to his neighborhood and
the feeder he enjoys.
Sometimes wildlife can’t escape injury when they have a mishap.
Take as an example this turtle that was rescued from a popular
Fort Wayne fishing pond. Fishing line and a hook had been left
behind for this turtle to discover as he crawled along the ground.
The hook pierced through his eye and needed to be removed
before infection could kill him. It is not uncommon for wildlife to
suffer when they become entangled in fishing line that has been
left near river banks and ponds.
Children find wildlife and often want to help. Remind them that handling wildlife can result in further injury. Having
a discussion about wildlife is important for the safety of children and prevents you from having a basket of chirping
baby birds in your kitchen in the middle of the night.
When in doubt about what to do, give our office a call or Google search answers that will help you ascertain when
baby wildlife is old enough to be left alone.

The Joy of Special People
...continued from page 1
Even our staff has commented on how they may be having a stressful work day and when they look out the window and see
one (or many) of our adoption dogs outside enjoying their time with a handful of volunteers, we are all reminded of our real
purpose and we are refreshed with a positive outlook and soon, wonderful adoptive families will come in and take these very
special animals in our care to their forever homes!
Our dog walker volunteers come in all ages; we have entire families and couples that dedicate their time together to help
the dogs in our care. Not only do our dogs benefit, but the volunteers do as well, so if you have one hour a week that you
could spare, please consider joining our growing numbers of volunteer dog walkers. All the information on volunteering can
be found on our website at www.FWACC.org. We hope you will consider joining us.

PET PARENTING CLASS KEEPS DOGS
AND OWNERS TOGETHER
Bringing home a new dog or
puppy is a special time.
Making certain your home and
family are prepared for the pet
is paramount. To help keep
dogs and owners together,
Animal Care & Control
launched a new pet parenting
class held once a month in the
Mary
Koons
Education
Center. Pet parenting doesn’t
come easy for everyone,
especially a novice pet owner
that might not understand normal stages of dog development.

Allison Miller and Rebecca Gremaux

Duke’s family attended to learn about using a crate for housetraining. They were
worried that using a crate might be cruel, but had heard that a crate could be
equal to a dog’s den. The Harvey family recently adopted Ginger, a small terrier
mix with a big personality. She hadn’t done anything the family was overly concerned about, but said they wanted to be sure to be prepared.
Adoption Supervisor Allison Miller and volunteer Rebecca Gremaux created the
parenting class, to target new dog owners with basic animal care information. At
this stage, it’s important to focus on consistencies. The lecture with video covers
crate training, housetraining, chewing, jumping, and other basic house manners
that every dog and owner should learn. Of course it wouldn’t be an Animal Care
& Control presentation if we didn’t also share information on spaying and neutering, City pet registrations, City leash laws, and pet vaccinations.
Pet Parenting sessions are offered the first Monday of each month from 6–7:30
p.m. and are free to the public, although donations to the adoption program are
welcomed. While reservations are not required, seating is limited to 65 attendees.
Dogs should not be brought to the program. For additional information, call 4275511 or watch for sessions to be listed on our website at www.fwacc.org.

FROM THE DIRECTOR
It is amazing to see some of the progress we have made
in saving animals’ lives in our community; our spay and
neuter initiatives, HeadStart training program, pet parenting classes, web site and education outreach, and
Belinda Lewis
let’s not forget an amazingly successful adoption proExecutive Director
gram. All are doing wonderful things! Most of these specialty programs are accomplished with your donor dollars. We have
long been a leader in our country with legislative and programmatic
activity designed to create a safer community and prevent unnecessary
euthanasia.
The sad reality to that happy news is that too many cats and dogs are
still dying in Fort Wayne in spite of all our efforts. It was very telling for
us when we recently offered a four-day Spay Day USA promotion to
spay or neuter fifty pit bulls at absolutely no charge and only 18 pet owners wanted to take us up on the deal! There is always a silver lining
though, as our total cats and dogs altered through the event came to 126.
It is still not enough! We are embarking on some new initiatives here in
Fort Wayne to attempt to quell the stream of animals into the shelter.
While we can find homes for many of these unwanted furry friends, the
demand cannot begin to meet the supply of homeless pets. Where do
they all come from? As we seek to increase spaying and neutering in
our community pets, do we have the big picture? Are we doing all we
can?
We will be teaming with other animal-related organizations this year to
move toward more collaborative initiatives in the fight against pet overpopulation in Fort Wayne and Allen County. The formula to success may
be the coalition approach. We are not even sure we have a handle on
where all these animals are coming from right now.
Other communities have addressed this issue with strong ordinances,
as we have here in the Fort. While that is a help, it is still not the only
answer when the intake of dogs and cats to this shelter still exceeded
14,000 in 2006. One thing we see in successful communities is the partnership between the legislative authority of the government based animal shelter and a larger volume of non-profit groups with animal related
missions. We seem to be missing that non-profit collaborative component in Fort Wayne and hope to see some excitement build with future
opportunities.
We continue to work toward betterment for animals here in the Fort and
can only do that with your help! Thank you for helping us help the animals.

Dear Animal Care & Control,
My family adopted Lover Boy
this past June and all I can say
is WOW. He is a great dog. I
can’t believe someone gave him
up--how fortunate for us. We
are going to rename him,
but haven’t found that perfect name yet. He loves
his new yard. He minds
so well--even leaving the
wild baby rabbits alone
when he is told “no.”
We stopped at my mom’s already, so he could meet his new playmate and they had a blast running around their 2-acre yard.
Needless to say Lover Boy was exhausted. Oddly enough, he
was up at 6:30 the next morning ready
to start over.
He never barked until last night when
there was some action in a lot across
the street, and then, I appreciated
that meaningful bark. I think he’ll be
a great watch dog. He never even
barked at the neighbor’s dog when
L

him. Also, he seems to be completely housetrained--I hope that’s true.
Anyway, so far, everything is great. What a perfect fit.

WISH LIST:
If you are looking for a
worthy service project for a
club or if you are a pet
lover willing to lend a
hand, the following list of

ADDED HOURS AND VOLUNTEERS BENEFIT ADOPTIONS
The Animal Care & Control
Adoption Center is now open the
first Saturday of every month from
11:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. to increase
the chances that pets will be
adopted. Saturday hours are
made possible by numerous volunteers clamoring to help us
place pets into loving homes.
Fifteen volunteers are needed to
run each weekend adoption event
that can draw upwards of 120
families to our adoption center in
a four-hour span. By increasing
our hours, we have seen a steady
increase in the number of animals
adopted.

While not every municipal animal
control department has a volunteer program, we feel it is worth
seeking the donations that it takes
to bring volunteers in contact with
our
animals.
Volunteer
Coordinator Courtney Fanning
has what it takes to organize
troops of volunteers, and has
expanded our program by 39%
since taking over the coordinator
position in January 2007.
Volunteers have many positions
within our department. Some
feed animals and clean adoption
rooms while others greet customers or serve as adoption coun-

selors. Volunteers care for our
adoption cats at Kitty City, which
is our off-site adoption program
located inside Pet Supplies Plus
on Coldwater Road. Dogs that
need an introduction to good
manners get training from volunteer HeadStart trainers, and dogs
that need baths get cleaned by
volunteers during Monday night
dog wash. From fundraising and
education events, to assisting
shelter
veterinarians
with
spay/neuter surgeries, volunteers
line up to lend a hand. In the end,
animals and their new owners are
the better for it.

Lady had wedged her head inside

inside a large tree in the backyard. Lady was hot and clearly in
physical distress.
Animal Care Supervisor Laura
Rowe consulted with Gaines’ veterinarian before administering a
light tranquilizer in hopes that
Lady’s head could be freed.
According to Rowe, Lady was in
serious danger from possible
heatstroke or strangulation and
had been stuck in the base of the
tree for about 45 minutes.
After relaxing the dog and still not

“At one point I wasn’t sure Lady

Lady has recovered and is safe to
play in her yard now that the hole
in the tree has been patched.

ADOPTED IDOLS
When animals are adopted from
our shelter, they become household celebrities in the eyes of
those who love them. Owners frequently write to tell us about their
famed adopted pets. They are
pampered, adored, and celebrated. They bring years of joy and
laughter to families, comfort to
seniors, and friendship to children.
Many are the superstars of their
neighborhood.
We hear that some of our adopted
dogs hold prominence with customers where they accompany
their owners to work. One teen entered his family’s adopted cat
into a 4-H cat show and won first place. We are told that some of
our adopted dogs have become service dogs, while others have
been featured in print ads and television commercials.
And now, we have one of our adopted dogs being featured in a
published children’s book. Moose on the Loose, written by Patricia
Knaebe, is a charming story of how a lost puppy finds a loving
home. The real Moose is a golden-eyed, toy-loving, gentle giant
that was adopted by Patricia Knaebe and Bill Hadlock seven years
ago. Patricia’s book about Moose celebrates their special puppy’s
journey from the shelter, to a new home, to receiving his name. We
at Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control are smiling at yet another
shelter animal turned adopted idol. To purchase a copy of Moose
on the Loose call 427-5508.

SOME ENCHANTED EVENING
How do people meet and fall in
love? No doubt, timing is everything - to be in the right place, at the
right time, to notice the absolute
right one. As the song goes, "Some
enchanted evening you may see a
stranger across a crowded room."

Volunteer Coordinator Courtney Miller and Abby toss the puck

For dogs and owners, it can happen the very same way. At least
that's what our adoption staff and
volunteers are banking on in a new
outreach program called Paws and
Pucks. It entails taking dogs by
invitation to select Komet Hockey
games at the Memorial Coliseum.

Thousands of hockey fans receive a warm
greeting by Animal Care & Control adoption
dogs at the entrance gate. Tails wag, people
smile and stop to say hello, and there you
have it again - the right family, at the right
place and time, to meet that absolute right
dog.
We applaud the volunteers and staff members who are giving their time to this cause.
Most of all, we thank Komet Hockey Hall of
Fame Member Robbie Laird and his wife
Madeleine for putting it all together.
We introduced seven dogs at the first two
events, and thanks to Komet Hockey fans all
were adopted within a few days following
each event. Fans loved watching Abby, a

While we still wrap up all our work from 2007, we’re leaping
into 2008! Our accomplishments from 2007 have served as
a launching pad for the new year and we’re excited about
some new opportunities. You have a lot to do with that!
Belinda Lewis
Executive Director

In 2007, our Animal Care and Control Commission ramped
up its fundraising to support the non-tax based programming that our department pursues. The reason we are able to do so much more for our city than
common governmental shelters is seated in our citizen community involvement. Your donation dollars are keeping some of these extra lifesaving programs moving forward.
Our volunteer program, a completely donor-supported entity, is teaming with
the Fort Wayne Komets and Coliseum to increase adoptions and shelter
exposure by attending local games during the ‘07-‘08 season with adoption
animals. Go volunteers! With almost 900 hours of volunteer service monthly, this shelter would not function as we do without their involvement in all that
is positive!
New legislation was passed in Indiana last year making animal cruelty a
felony when connected with domestic violence. That level of case work was
just the incentive we needed to advance our crime scene processing in order
to stop this kind of violence. Outfitting our officers with appropriate crime
scene “toolkits” and the training to use them during advanced cruelty case
investigation will be a goal that requires some of that community support we
so cherish here. All animals benefit when we provide training and equipment
to ensure that we’re getting the job done right and providing something the
prosecutors can support in the court system.
February is the month we honor Spay Day USA and you can read more about
“Neuter for a Nickel” here in the newsletter. With the assistance of some local
veterinarians and your donation dollars, we will be preventing the birth and
potential euthanasia of unwanted cats and kittens in our community. We will
continue our efforts at outreach and partnerships with the local veterinary
community to encourage spaying and neutering of pets as a preventive
approach to pet overpopulation here in Fort Wayne.
In late 2007, a community input panel on dangerous dogs was convened to
examine the impact of biting dogs and whether or not more could be done to
ensure safety while protecting responsible pet owners. In order to dedicate
our energies to the panel, we put a plan on hold which was to work toward
animal organization coalition building. Little did we know the start of our
coalition building was happening right in that room! As we move into 2008,
we already have some strong direction in those efforts to save more animals’
lives here in Fort Wayne using the theory that we are all much stronger when
united. While we may have varying missions between public safety demands
and adoption as a sole purpose for existence, we can benefit animals and
one another with better organizational relationships. The word for 2008 is
synergism!

Thank you FWAC&C staff and volunteers,
We are so thankful for our cat family.
They bring us so much joy. And we think
they are enjoying themselves too.
We adopted Sophie
a n d
R o s i e
and
three
months later they
were right at home. They spend
their days playing kitten games with
Sophie an
d Rosie
each other, taking plenty of cat naps
and hanging out with the kids. They
don’t want our other cat, three-year-old Sally, to feel left out
and often look for ways to tease their big sister. Sally seems to
enjoy the excitement the kittens bring to our home as much as we
do.

WISH LIST:
If you are looking for a
worthy service project for a
club or if you are a pet
lover willing to lend a
hand, the following list of
items is much needed by
our department. We cared
for 15,919 animals last
year, so supplies are
always on our list. Any
donation is immensely
appreciated by staff, volunteers and of course, our
animals.

Keno
I adopted a dog from you in
November. His name is Keno and

He has become acquainted with my two horses and they play

to run. I have about 20 acres so he can run and run and run. He
also had his first bath and trim and he was a perfect gentleman.

Please extend my sincerest gratitude to all the staff that helped
us help Keno. We greatly appreciate them. It’s always a wonderful thing to know you saved another animal and that they are
healthy and happy.

Above all, we appreciate
cash donations to help us
secure medical needs for
sick, injured, and underweight animals and to support special programs benefiting animals.

GRANT HELPS FORT WAYNE DOGS
Fort Wayne Animal Care &
Control was fortunate to receive a
$12,600 grant just in time for winter to launch a program targeting
the health and welfare of dogs living within the City of Fort Wayne.
S.C.O.R.E., Stop Cruelty through
Officer Referral and Education
enables animal control officers to
assist city dogs that live outside in
substandard conditions.
The
funding allows for the purchase of
doghouses, flea treatments,
straw, and appropriate collars,
while offering spay/neuter assistance where officers have
assessed need.
This initiative addresses multiple
issues and goals, which is to bet-

ter educate dog owners, make
referrals where there is need, and
improve the relationship between
dogs and people. It's a winning
merger of officers assisting families with practical solutions that
keep dogs healthy, safe, and in
their
homes.
To date, the program has helped
about 200 area dogs.
We recognize that hard times can
affect any family, but we don't
want people to be forced into giving up their dog. If you know a
family and dog in need of our
assistance within the city of Fort
Wayne please call our main office
at 427-1244.

TETHERING LAWS GIVE RELIEF TO FORT WAYNE
and neighbors get relief from
nighttime barking.

Not everyone agrees on whether
dogs should live inside or outside
the home, but as of January 2008
City Council agreed that Fort
Wayne dogs are better off when
not tethered outside for extended
periods of time. The new tethering
law will impact public nuisance
barking and public safety.
Between the hours of 11 p.m. and
6 a.m. dogs are no longer allowed
to be tethered, a duel benefit as
dogs get relief from being chained

Other provisions in the law target
the aggression that builds in dogs
when they are chained, which is a
leading factor in dog bites. No
dog under the age of six months
and no dog that hasn't been
spayed or neutered can be tethered at any time, day or night.
Fenced yards and kennels are
acceptable providing the dog has
access to a proper shelter and
provisions such as potable water.
No more than three altered dogs
are allowed to be tethered simultaneously on one property.
Multiple dogs may not have contact while they are tethered and

the required six foot lead may not
reach within three feet of another
property, public thoroughfare, or
right of way. It is quite common
for Animal Control Officers to be
sent to a home where chained
dogs have become tangled and
owners are absent. Therefore,
the new law prohibits tethering a
dog that officers have had to
untangle more than two times in a
year.
The new tethering law is a major
accomplishment for the welfare of
dogs in Fort Wayne and towards
the safety and livability of citizens.
We appreciate the hard work and
support of those that made this
law possible.

IT’S A FACT
Cats are America's most popular pets, but they are also the pet most likely to die prematurely from illness or injury. Most of these untimely deaths
can be prevented by simply not allowing cats to roam free outdoors.
 The estimated life span of a free-roaming cat is less than three
years
 Cats that live inside have a life span of up to 20 years
 The majority of veterinarians recommend keeping cats indoors
 Fewer than 5% of "found" cats taken in by animal shelters are
claimed by their owner
Your home offers a safer, healthier environment than life on the street.
Simply provide your cat with the same stimulus that nature would provide.
Interactive toys, a scratching post, and a window perch will keep any cat
happy. Protect the life of your cat by keeping it vaccinated, registered, and
inside your home.

NEUTER FOR A NICKEL
During the annual February Spay Day USA our hard-working staff and our
veterinarians pulled together with volunteers to offer an event aimed at
saving the lives of cats. Allen County residents were given a chance to
bring any male cat to the shelter to be neutered for the cost of one nickel
during the weekend event. Seven cats per residence were eligible. The initiative to reduce unplanned litters born in spring was funded with private
donations. Citizens interested in helping to fund future spay neuter events
can contact the shelter at 427-1244.

ANGEL FUND STORY
As designer dogs become more
popular and more populated, shelters like ours are seeing them surrendered by owners unprepared to
provide either the finances or time
for a dog. A common misconception is that pure breed dogs and
special designer dogs have a better future because they cost more.
In reality, nearly 25% of all dogs
entering our department are pure
breeds. Once here, they become

In total, it took ten weeks to bring

deserves.

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DOG LAW
A change to City Ordinance now
gives animal control officers a tool
to impede a dog's actions that will
land
a
case
in
court.
The law provides for a classification of "Potentially Dangerous," so
that behaviors of a dog can be preempted with proactive measures
before a situation becomes lifethreatening. What's more is that
the Potentially Dangerous classification will work towards reducing

dog bites in Fort Wayne.
If a dog attacks or bites a person or
animal while running loose it can
be ordered to be spayed or
neutered. The owner of the dog
may be required to attend a
responsible dog care class.
Depending on the nature of the
attack and the injuries of the victim,
other mandates are possible.

The owner may be directed never
to tether the dog once declared
potentially dangerous, and the
dog's confinement can be specified
by Animal Care & Control.
Working to create a city where citizens are safe and dogs are responsibly cared for is a goal we can all
embrace.
The Potentially
Dangerous ordinance helps us to
do just that.

BETTER WITH A BUDDY IS BACK
Thanks to our
Better With a
Buddy program
more cats will
be able to find
homes in 2008.
That’s news we
all like to hear.
Cat enthusiasts are offered the
option of adopting two well-socialized cats from our shelter, but only

paying the fee of one. All additional
costs are offset by a grant awarded
to Animal Care & Control from
Maddie's Fund.
The fee for adopting one cat is $65,
which includes a mandatory spay
or neuter surgery, the distemper
combination
vaccination,
microchip, flea treatment, and informational send-home package. In
addition, local veterinarians donate

the first health exam required within seven days of adoption.
Cats are affectionate, friendly companions that love to play and cuddle with others of their kind. Since
many of the shelter's cats are
housed together and accustom to
being with other cats, they adjust
quicker by going home with a
buddy.

VOLUNTEER INTERVIEW
WITH JACK SAGER
How long have you been volunteering?
For 2 ½ wonderful years.

Jack Sager

What inspired you to volunteer with
FWACC?
I was prompted to start because of my
love of animals. I made a visit to the
shelter, and found out I could help.

What do you do with the animals?
I am an adoption counselor, Head Start Trainer and I also
assist with cleaning in the morning. I come in two days a
week for at least 3 hours at a time. My favorite position is
adoption counseling.
What do you find to be the most rewarding part of volunteering?
A sense of excitement each time I make a match for an
animal and its new family. I would like to add that I also
find a great sense of accomplishment when families send
us letters with photos and updates of their new pet. I really love to see that my work has paid off.
Jack is an exceptional volunteer! He is incredibly dedicated, he loves helping animals and people. We are very
pleased to have his talents here at the shelter.
