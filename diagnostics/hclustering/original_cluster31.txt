Census Jobs!
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ‚Ä¢ Economics and Statistics Administration ‚Ä¢ U.S. CENSUS BUREAU

The Census Bureau is an
Equal Opportunity Employer
A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY: EARN MONEY WHILE
YOU SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY
In the near future, the U.S. Census Bureau will conduct a
special census in this area. Your community has requested it
and will incur the cost. Local residents will be needed to work
as census takers. Census takers visit households and collect
a few facts about each member such as name, age,
relationship to the householder, etc.
WHY A SPECIAL CENSUS?
Local governments consider up-to-date population
information beneficial to residents to determine the allocation
of state funds to communities, improved ability to plan for
schools, better transportation, and for many other purposes.
Your community may benefit from this updated official
population count.
TRAINING
Before you go to work, you will attend a training session
where you will learn the use of census forms and census
techniques such as interviewing and map reading. In most
cases, your supervisor will train you, assign and review
your work, and answer questions.
PAY
You will be paid for actual hours of work including time spent
in training. You will get specific information about pay from
the census supervisor.
DUTIES
When you have successfully completed your training, you
will be given several neighborhood blocks called
"Assignment Areas". Normally, your first assignment will be
the area in which you live. You will be provided a map of
each Assignment Area and the necessary census forms
and materials to do the job. Most of the jobs are in the field,
and require you to locate and interview households and
record information about the residents. When you accept
your appointment, you assume an obligation to stay with
the job until your assignment is completed.
The information you collect is confidential and
must not be disclosed to anyone who has not
sworn to protect Census Bureau information.

HOW CAN YOU QUALIFY FOR CENSUS WORK?
1. Noncitizens will only be considered for census jobs if
qualified citizens are not available, particularly in areas
where bilingual ability is a necessary qualification. You
must present documentation of employment eligibility.
The types of acceptable documentation are listed on
the reverse side of this page.
2. You may be hired if you are 18 years or older. If you
are under 18 and a function of the job is to drive, then
you cannot be hired. (Those ages 16 and 17 may be
hired for positions not involving driving so long as they
meet state and local employment requirements.)
3. You must have a valid Social Security Number.
4. Applicants must take a written test of basic skills. The
test may be taken in Spanish, upon request, along with
an English Proficiency Test.
5. Most census jobs require the employee to conduct
face-to-face interviews with respondents. This involves
visiting respondents in a variety of residence types,
asking questions and recording responses.
6. Male applicants born after December 31, 1959, must
be registered with the Selective Service System.
7. The Census Bureau performs criminal background
checks and reviews criminal records (including
fingerprinting) as part of assessing applicants‚Äô past
conduct and suitability for employment.
8. You will not engage in any partisan political activity
while on duty.
9. All non-census employment (including law and
regulatory enforcement jobs) will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis for compatibility with Census
Bureau employment.
10. Applicants must be available to work days, evenings,
and weekends. Since not all people will be home during
the day, you will have to visit some homes during the
evening and on the weekends. This will usually be no
later than 9:00 p.m. You generally will have flexibility to
choose which hours to work during these productive
time periods.

agency? If "YES," use Item 32 to write for each job a) the name and address of the employer; b) the
approximate date you left the job, and c) an explanation of the problem and the reason for leaving.

31. Are you delinquent on any federal debt? (Include delinquencies arising from federal taxes, loans, overpayment of

***** APD Asks Citizens to Help Clear Sidewalks and Remove Snowed-in Vehicles
*****
Posted by thowens on January 30, 2014
The Auburn Police Department is receiving complaints concerning snow-covered
sidewalks that are either impassible or too slippery and dangerous to use.
Additionally, snow-covered sidewalks are making it difficult for mail delivery,
utility meter checks, and children walking to school or in the neighborhood. As
a result, more pedestrians are walking in the street, which is equally unsafe--
particularly in these weather conditions.
The APD understands that the amount of snowfall and extremely cold temperatures
this winter season have made it difficult to keep up with clearing sidewalks.
However, with a short break from the cold temperatures and snow accumulation,
the department is asking citizens to clear their sidewalks, as well as help any
neighbors--particularly the elderly or handicapped persons--who may be unable
to shovel or clear snow. The removal of snow and ice from sidewalks is required
by Auburn City Ordinance 95.12. Those who fail to clear their sidewalks could
be charged for the expense of snow removal.
Citizens are also being reminded that vehicles parked on public property that
have not been moved for 24 hours, as well as parked vehicles that constitute a
hazard or obstruction to the movement of vehicular traffic, are considered
abandoned under state law and are subject to tow at the owner's expense. The
APD reminds citizens who park on the street and have been plowed-in to move
their vehicles to an area that is clear so that the streets can continue to be
cleared.

Air Quality - Particulate Alert
Effective Date: Friday-Sunday December 12-14, 2014
Evansville, Indiana ‚Äì December 12, 2014
Air Quality Forecast: Please be advised that outdoor concentrations of fine particulate matter (2.5 micrometers in diameter or
less), also known as PM2.5, may reach the ‚ÄúUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups‚Äù range established by the U.S. EPA National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS).

Air Quality Index

PM2.5 24-hr Average (¬µg/m3)

Good (0-50)

0 - 12.0

Moderate (51 ‚Äì 100)

12.1 ‚Äì 35.4

‚Üí Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101 ‚Äì 150)

35.5 ‚Äì 55.4

Unhealthy (151 ‚Äì 200)

55.5 ‚Äì 150.4

Very Unhealthy (201 ‚Äì 300)

150.5 ‚Äì 250.4

HAZARDOUS (301 ‚Äì 500)

> 250.5

According to the U.S. EPA, short-term exposures to fine particles (hours or days) can aggravate lung disease, causing asthma attacks
and acute bronchitis, and may also increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. People considered most sensitive to particulate
matter include children, teenagers, older adults, and those with heart or lung disease. For people with heart disease, short-term
exposures have been linked to heart attacks and arrhythmias. Healthy children and adults have not been reported to suffer serious
effects from short-term exposures, although they may experience temporary minor irritation when particle levels are elevated
(http://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=particle_health.index ).
PM2.5 can be high at any time of day or night. To minimize health effects:
ÔÇ∑ Sensitive groups ‚Äì Reduce prolonged or heavy exertion. It‚Äôs OK to be active outside, but take more breaks and do less intense
activities. Watch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.
ÔÇ∑ People with asthma ‚Äì Follow your action plan and keep quick relief medicine nearby.
ÔÇ∑ People with heart disease - If you experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, or unusual fatigue, contact
your health care provider.
Do your share to protect air quality and reduce pollution levels:
ÔÇ∑ OPEN BURNING IS PROHIBITED during an air quality alert. The use of gas and charcoal grills for cooking is permitted, however
postponement is recommended.
ÔÇ∑ REDUCE AUTOMOBILE DRIVING AND IDLING TIMES. Please avoid drive-thrus and idling whenever possible. Combine trips and
take efficient routes to and from your destinations.
ÔÇ∑ Conserve energy ‚Äì turn off lights, reduce air conditioning or heating use, etc.
ÔÇ∑ Use public transit, car pool, or walk/bike to your destination, if possible.
ÔÇ∑ Consider using electric or manually operated lawn and garden equipment.
ÔÇ∑ Limit the use of cleaning fluids, paint thinners or other materials containing volatile organic compounds (VOC).

CARMEL PARTIAL SPECIAL CENSUS FAQs
This summer the U.S. Census Bureau will conduct a partial special census in Carmel.
Why a special census?
Carmel is growing, and a documented increase in population will lead to a greater share of state
revenue. This will be a partial special census, with enumeration taking place only in those areas
where growth has been documented.
When will Carmel‚Äôs special census take place?
The best estimate right now is that the actual enumeration will take place in July and August.
The exact date is dependent on some factors over which Carmel has no control, but Carmel must
recruit an adequate number of census workers before the process can begin.
What are the job duties?
Census takers (enumerators) will locate and visit specified households, update addresses and
collect a few facts about each member of the household such as name, age and relationship to
householder. There will also be need for a few supervisors and clerical workers.
What are the qualifications for the job?
Minimum age of 18
U.S. citizenship
For positions that require driving, a valid driver‚Äôs license and access to a vehicle
Not employed in law enforcement
What are the work hours?
Applicants must be able to work days, evening and weekends. Since many people are not home
during the day, enumerators will have work evenings and weekends, usually no later than 9:00
p.m. Enumerators will generally have flexibility to choose which hours to work during
productive time periods. All employees are expected to work a minimum of 25 hours each week
and a maximum of 40 hours. Overtime is not required or authorized. Jobs will last anywhere
from 2 to 8 weeks (3-5 weeks on average). Employees are expected to work for the duration of
their assignment.
How much will census workers be paid?
Enumerators (majority of positions)........... $13.74 per hour
Crew Leaders ............................................. $15.24 per hour
Clerical Workers ........................................ $10.74 per hour

How do I apply for a census job?
An application can be picked up at City Hall or on the City of Carmel‚Äôs Website:
www.carmel.in.gov Please return completed application to the Human Resource Department
at One Civic Square, Carmel, IN 46032.
What else do applicants have to do before they can be hired?
Pass a written test for general knowledge and basic skills.
Pass an FBI background check.
Will census employees receive training?
All those selected for an assignment will be trained in the use of census forms and census
techniques such as interviewing and map reading. Training time will be paid.

Reflecting Pool (excluding the area known as Veteran‚Äôs Plaza), Gazebo, Fountain Area and City Hall, in accordance
with this Facility Use Policy. Veteran‚Äôs Plaza is not available for use, as it is considered a solemn memorial honoring
living and deceased American Veterans. Due to the wide variety of events and activities for which the use of a City
facility may be requested, the City, by and through its Board of Public Works and Safety (‚ÄúBoard‚Äù), reserves the right
to require additional terms and conditions as circumstances dictate.
FACILITY USE REQUEST PROCEDURES

A.

Applicant shall complete the attached Facility Use Request Form and Acknowledgement Agreement, and any
additional attachments (if applicable) as described in items 5 and 9 below. They are to be delivered or mailed
to the Carmel City Hall, Attn: Lobby Reception Desk, One Civic Square, Carmel, IN 46032 a minimum of (1)
month prior to the planned date of the event or activity. Approval of the request must be granted by the
Board, which meets on the first and third Wednesday of each month. The Board will not generally consider
any application which does not meet the deadline discussed above.

B.

No fee will be charged to use the City‚Äôs Reflecting Pool, Gazebo, Fountain Area or City Hall.

C.

A security deposit of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), in the form of a certified check or money order made
