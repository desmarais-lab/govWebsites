This subchapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. Any reference in this subchapter to the Flood
Insurance Rate Map, or FIRM, refers to the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Allen County and Incorporated Areas
dated August 3, 2009, and any future revisions thereto. These maps, along with any subsequent revisions and/or
updates, are hereby adopted by reference and made a part of this subchapter. The best available regulatory flood
data is listed below. If a party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace the existing data with
data based on a detailed engineering study and submit it to the Department of Natural Resources for review and
approval.
(A) The regulatory flood elevation for the floodplain of all studied watercourses shall be as delineated on the flood
profiles in the current Flood Insurance Study of Allen County and Incorporated Areas prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency dated August 3, 2009, and any future revisions thereto, and as shown on the
current Flood Insurance Rate Maps of Allen County and Incorporated Areas.
(B) In cases where a submitted topographic or topographic/utility survey indicates an area that by elevation would

§157.166 IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT.
No construction or development which requires an Improvement Location Permit according to the terms of this
subchapter shall commence within a floodplain prior to the issuance of an Improvement Location Permit from the
Zoning Enforcement Officer. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall not issue an Improvement Location Permit if
the proposed use, structure, site work, or development does not meet the applicable requirements of this
subchapter.
(A) Any use permitted within the floodway or the floodway fringe which does not involve the construction of
structures shall not require an improvement location permit. This shall include but not be limited to:
(1)

Agricultural uses;

(2)

Wildlife areas, nature preserves, forests and wetlands;

(3)

Public parks and recreational uses, such as golf courses and driving ranges, and play areas;

(4)

Public and quasi-public utility collection and/or transmission lines, pipes, cables, and the like;

(5)

Public transportation facilities such as roads, streets, and bridges which are located in public rights-ofway;

(6)

Public works projects for flood control improvements such as levees, dikes, floodwalls, and dams;

(7)

Private transportation facilities such as roads, bridges, or driveways which are necessary to access private
property;

(8)

Parking lots or parking areas; however, any parking lot or parking area proposed to be located within the
floodway must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Natural Resources prior to the issuance of
a City parking lot permit.
However, these uses shall still be subject to review as necessary to determine compliance with the
applicable provisions of this subchapter.

(B) Upon receipt of an application for an Improvement Location Permit, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
determine if the site is located within an identified floodway, floodway fringe, or within the floodplain where the
limits of the floodway have not yet been determined. If necessary, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may route
the application to other appropriate City Departments for assistance in this determination.
(1)

If the site is located within an identified floodway, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall inform the
applicant that the permit cannot be issued, unless the request is for a use or development permitted under
§157.162. In that instance, prior to the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit, the applicant must
furnish a copy of any applicable Indiana Department of Natural Resources construction permit required by
IC 14-28-1.

(2)

If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may issue an
Improvement Location Permit provided there is compliance with the applicable provisions of §§157.162,
157.168, and 157.169 of this subchapter.

28

(3)

If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet
been determined (shown as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map), the Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall require the applicant to forward plans and specifications to the Department of Natural Resources,
requesting a review and letter of recommendation.
(a)

If the review indicates the site is in the floodway, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall not issue an
Improvement Location Permit, unless the request is for a use or development permitted under §157.162.
In that instance, prior to the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit, the applicant must furnish a
copy of any applicable Indiana Department of Natural Resources construction permit required by IC 1428-1.
(b)
If the review indicates the site is in the floodway fringe, the Improvement Location Permit may be
issued provided there is compliance with the applicable provisions of§§157.162, 157.168, and 157.169 of
this subchapter.
(c)
If the review indicates the upstream drainage area is less than one square mile, an engineering
study of the site shall be completed by the applicant and submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
A determination shall then be made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer with assistance if needed by
other appropriate City Departments, or the Allen County Surveyor’s office, as to whether the site is in
the floodway or floodway fringe. No permit shall be issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer if the
site is within the floodway, unless the request is for a use or development permitted under §157.162. In
that instance, prior to the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit, the applicant must furnish a
copy of any applicable Indiana Department of Natural Resources construction permit required by IC 1428-1. If the site is in the floodway fringe, the Improvement Location Permit may be issued provided
there is compliance with the applicable provisions of §§157.162 157.168, and 157.169, of this subchapter.
(C) The application for an Improvement Location Permit shall be accompanied by the following:
(1)

A plan showing the location of existing and proposed structures, and existing and proposed land grades
on the site;

(2)

The proposed elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed development.
Elevation should be in National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) or North American Vertical
Datum (NAVD). In either case, the conversion formula should be included;

(3)

A plan showing the location of existing and proposed structures in relation to any stream, drain, ditch, or
waterway; and

(4)

Any additional information which may be necessary to determine the disposition of a proposed
development or structure with respect to the requirements of this subchapter.

(D) After the Zoning Enforcement Officer has determined that a requested Improvement Location Permit can be
issued for any structure in the floodway fringe, the permit shall be issued for the construction of the foundation
and lowest floor only. Prior to the Zoning Enforcement Officer issuing a release for the remaining construction,
the applicant shall submit a completed Elevation Certificate showing the elevation of the lowest floor. The
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain a record of all submitted Elevation Certificates.
(Ord. G-20-95, passed 7-25-95)
§157.169 BUILDING PROTECTION STANDARDS.
In addition to the damage prevention requirements of §157.168, all buildings to be located in the SFHA shall be
protected from flood damage below the flood protection grade.
(A) This building protection requirement applies to the following situations:
(1)

Construction, reconstruction or placement of a new primary structure;

29

(2)

Construction or reconstruction of an addition to an existing building, that constitutes substantial
improvement, or is proposed for a building after the one-time exclusion noted in §157.163 has been used
for that building;

(3)

Structural alterations and/or renovations made to an existing building, that constitute substantial
improvement; or are proposed for a building after the one-time exclusion noted in §157.163 has been used
for that building;

(4)

accessory structure over 144 square feet in size;

(5)

Reconstruction or repairs made to a building that experienced substantial damage. Any structure
receiving substantial damage must comply with all applicable requirements of this subchapter, regardless
of the level of repairs actually made to the structure;

(6)

Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This
subchapter does not apply to returning an existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully
occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage or installing/replacing a manufactured or mobile
home on an existing site within a legal nonconforming mobile or manufactured home park or subdivision;
and

(7)

Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days.

(B) The building protection standards may be met by one of the following methods. The Zoning Enforcement
Officer shall maintain a record of compliance with these building protection standards as required in §157.166 of
this subchapter.
(1)

A structure or addition to a structure may be constructed on a site within the floodway fringe on
permanent fill in accordance with the applicable portions of §157.168(B), and the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)

(d)
(e)

The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compacting to 95 percent dry
density obtainable according to the Standard Proctor or Modified Proctor test method;
The fill shall extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building or to the property line,
whichever is less, before sloping below the flood protection grade;
The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap,
bulkheading, or other acceptable method. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper
than 3 to 1 (horizontal to vertical);
The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto any adjacent properties;
The top of the lowest floor of the structure or addition shall be at or above the flood protection
grade.

The applicant shall submit a plan, certified by a registered Professional Engineer, showing how items 1(b) and 1(d)
above will be met prior to the issuance of the Improvement Location Permit for the project. The applicant shall submit
compaction test results after the fill has been placed. Compliance with the remaining applicable items listed under
section (B)(1) above shall be verified as necessary after the fill has been placed, prior to the issuance of the certificate
of compliance for the project. If necessary, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may rely on other appropriate City
departments for any required assistance in documenting compliance with the fill requirements.
(2)

A structure or addition to a structure may be elevated in accordance with the following:
(a)

The structure or addition shall be elevated on posts, piers, columns, extended walls, or other types
of similar foundation provided:
(i) The walls of any enclosure below the elevated floor shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters, through
providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) having a total area of

30

one (1) square foot for every two (2) square feet of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom
of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and
(ii) Any enclosure below the elevated floor is only used for storage and building access;
(b)

The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows
and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current,
waves, ice, and floating debris;
(c)
All areas below the flood protection grade shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood
damage, including but not limited to poured concrete or treated lumber. The top of the lowest floor and
all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be
located at or above the flood protection grade. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines,
submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood protection
grade.
(3)

(4)

Manufactured homes to be installed or substantially improved on a site must meet one of the following
anchoring requirements:
(a)

The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest floor shall
be at or above the flood protection grade and securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured
homes to be placed on a site:
(i) Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
(ii) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
(iii) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
(iv) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred
“substantial damage” as a result of a flood.

placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially
damaged by a flood.

Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
(a)
(b)

(c)
(5)

Be on the site for less than 180 consecutive days; or
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system,
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and having no
permanently attached additions); or
meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” in §157.169(B)(4).

A non-residential structure or addition(s) to a structure may be floodproofed to the flood protection grade
(in lieu of elevating) if done in accordance with the following:
(a)

A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the portion of the structure and
attendant utility facilities located below the flood protection grade have been designed to be watertight
and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood; the building design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from debris or ice; and

(b)

Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside
source of electricity.

 ======================== Richmond ======================== Democratic ======================== 

Chapter 153: ZONING OF FLOOD HAZARD AREAS AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Article 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives.
Section A. Statutory Authorization.
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land
use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Richmond does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
Section B. Findings of Fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the City of Richmond are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by
uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section C. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities.
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damage.
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(6) Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the City by fulfilling
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
Section D. Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) To protect human life and health.

(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains.
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood
prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
Article 2. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as
to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most
reasonable application.
A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall,
snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves
are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones
A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented
below:
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because
detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are
shown.
Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood
event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones.
(Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet.
Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average
flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base
flood protection.
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but
which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood
protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has
been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to
consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the
flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No
base flood elevations or depths are shown.

Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area 400 square feet or
less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal
initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood
damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage
sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a
structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall.
Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision
of this ordinance.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel
does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity
flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Base Flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent annual chance flood.
Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all
sides.
Boundary River means the part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between Kentucky and
Indiana.
Boundary River Floodway means the floodway of a boundary river.
Building - see "Structure."
Community means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.
Community Rating System (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance
Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular Program that have gone
beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide
protection from flooding.
Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great.
Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and
emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
D Zone means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding is possible.
Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in this
zone.

Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but
not limited to:
(1) construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure;
(2) installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or
installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days;
(3) installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects;
(4) construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes, dams, channel improvements,
etc.;
(5) mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations;
(6) construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
(7) storage of materials; or
(8) any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface
waters.
"Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and
facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of
permanent structures.
Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above
the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also
called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
Elevation Certificate is a certified statement that verifies a structure’s elevation information.
Emergency Program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is
intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in
that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM.
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry
land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters
from any source.

Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) means an official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated
the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The
report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface
elevation of the base flood.
Flood Prone Area means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to
inundation by water from any source. (See “Flood”)
Flood Protection Grade (FPG) is the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given
location in the SFHA. (see “Freeboard”)
Floodplain means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse
which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both
the floodway and the fringe districts.
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural
resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control
works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other
applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes
federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing
and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as
floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain
management requirements.
Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the
structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed
design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces,
including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces.
Floodproofing certificate is a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an
alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Architect.
Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the
channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the
regulatory flood of any river or stream.
Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for
the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors
that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.

Fringe is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional hardship that would
result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the
variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere
or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start
of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure
that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure
into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures
are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business
flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.
Letter of Final Determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update
process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the
community. The LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend
its floodplain management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has
previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and
amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map
Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill
(LOMR-F). The definitions are presented below:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the currently effective
FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of
property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA
map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations.
Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an

sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure.
Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following:
(1) The top of the lowest level of the structure.
(2) The top of the basement floor.

(3) The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure.
(4) The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
(5) The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated
structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters
unless:
a) the walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings
(in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure
has more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
b) the total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1) square inch for every one
square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one
(1) foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher; and,
c) such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building
access.
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to
the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and

by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash
value), or adjusted assessed values.
Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property
from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures,
and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance
available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts
of the Federal Government and the private insurance industry.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as
a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means any structure for which the “start of construction” commenced after the
effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the
community’s first floodplain ordinance.

Non-boundary river floodway means the floodway of any river or stream other than a boundary
river.
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum

Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock,
gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of
water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
One-percent annual chance flood is the flood that has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the onepercent annual chance flood. See “Regulatory Flood”.
Physical Map Revision (PMR) is an official republication of a community’s FEMA map to effect
changes to base (1-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations,
regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base
flood elevations or SFHAs.
Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire
community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or
basin.

comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance
are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.
Regulatory flood means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in Article 3 (B) of this ordinance. The
"Regulatory Flood" is also known by the term "Base Flood”, “One-Percent Annual Chance Flood”,
and “100-Year Flood”.
Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions
during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the
average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states
that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds
has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public

body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage
or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the City subject to
inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Richmond are generally identified as
such on the Wayne County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated April
2, 2015 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as
Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit
was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of
a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways;
nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building.
Structure means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof.
The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building.
The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures
that have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure",
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Suspension means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the
community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations
required for participation in the NFIP.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in
a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this
ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other
evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as
that documentation is provided.

Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or
over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in
which substantial flood damage may occur.
X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones
shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the
flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X
zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of
flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
Zone means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in
the area.
Zone A (see definition for A zone)
Zone B, C, and X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal
hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be
flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood
insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones.
(Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
Article 3. General Provisions.
Section A. Lands to Which This Ordinance Applies.
This ordinance shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the
City of Richmond.
Section B. Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data.
This ordinance’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data
is listed below.
(1) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs within the
jurisdiction of the City of Richmond shall be as delineated on the one-percent annual chance
flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Wayne County, Indiana and Incorporated
Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated April 2, 2015 as well as any
future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency with the most recent date.
(2) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the
jurisdiction of the City of Richmond, delineated as an "A Zone" on the Wayne County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated April 2, 2015 as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available
as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream
drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party
disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better
data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be
submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently
approved.

(3) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the
regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s
known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.
(4) Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more restrictive data in the new
(not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction
(development) purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data
provided by FEMA.
Section C. Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit.
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard.
Section D. Compliance.
No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA
without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. No land or
stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this
ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Section E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
Section F. Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations.
(1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM
and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.
(2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be
included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
(3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation and
not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the
floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a
LOMA.
Section G. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements.
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

Section H. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of
study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this ordinance does not
create any liability on the part of the City of Richmond, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance
or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
Section I. Penalties for Violation.
Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the
requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be
a violation of this ordinance. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated
as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for the City of Richmond. All
violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $2500.00 for the first violation and not less
than $50.00 or higher than $7,500 for the second or subsequent violations according to IC 36-1-3-8.
(1) A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist.
(2) The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a
willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood
Insurance Policy to be suspended.
(3) Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action to prevent or
remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons
responsible.
Article 4. Administration.
Section A. Designation of Administrator.
The Common Council of the City of Richmond hereby appoints the City Engineer to administer and
implement the provisions of this ordinance and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.

(2) Construction Stage.
Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated structure or structure constructed on
fill, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification
of the NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest
floor elevation survey data submitted. The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by
such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or
failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for
the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the elevation certification shall be at
the applicant’s risk.
Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a floodproofed structure, it shall be the
duty of the applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate.
Certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review the floodproofing
certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected by such review
before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification
or failure to make correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project.
(3) Finished Construction.
Upon completion of construction, an elevation certification which depicts the “as-built” lowest
floor elevation is required to be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the project
includes a floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification is required to be submitted by
the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.

(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed
development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than
the lesser of fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres.
(5) All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit density of
development permitted in the SFHA.
(6) All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and
vehicles (especially emergency responders).
Section D. Critical Facility.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the
SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor
elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
Section E. Standards for Identified Floodways.
Located within SFHAs, established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. The
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway
from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local

building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc.
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway.
(IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a residence in a
non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition
above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit or letter of authorization (when
applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization
has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this
ordinance have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the
permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future
development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the
floodway. This adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at
least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation
under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City shall submit the data
and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
Section F. Standards for Identified Fringe.
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this ordinance have
been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved
structure shall be at or above the FPG.
Section G. Standards for SFHAs without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or
Floodways/Fringes.
(1) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet
been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction
in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended
Flood Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.

Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a
floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued
provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than
the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the
provisions contained in Article 5 of this ordinance have been met.
(2) Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet
been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile,
the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis
showing the limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the
site.
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development
Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this ordinance have been met.
(3) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14
of one foot and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
Section H. Standards for Flood Prone Areas.
All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA
published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per Article 5.
Article 6. Variance Procedures.
Section A. Designation of Variance and Appeals Board.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from
requirements of this ordinance.
Section B. Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
ordinance. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the
Wayne County Circuit Court.
Section C. Variance Procedures.
In passing upon such applications, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and;
(1) The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(2) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner.
(3) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.

(4) The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable.
(5) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage.
(6) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development,
(7) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area.
(8) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
(9) The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the
floodwaters at the site.
(10)
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions,
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
Section D. Conditions for Variances.
(1) Variances shall only be issued when there is:
a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship.
c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
(2) No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to Article 5, Section E or Section
G (1) of this ordinance may be granted.
(3) Any variance granted in a floodway subject to Article 5, Section E or Section G (1) of this
ordinance will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
(4) Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of Article 5, Section B, may be
granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size,
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the flood
protection grade.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(6) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic
Sites and Structures.
(7) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the
difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is

to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (See Article 6, Section E).
(8) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources upon request (See Article 6, Section E).
Section E. Variance Notification.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built
below the flood protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a community
official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood protection grade will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and;
(2) Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks to life and property. A
copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the
County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of
the affected parcel of land.
The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance.
Section F. Historic Structure.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of
the structure.
Section G. Special Conditions.
Upon the consideration of the factors listed in Article 6, and the purposes of this ordinance, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
Article 7. Severability.
If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of the Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional
by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the
remaining portions of this Ordinance.
Article 8. Supplement to the City’s Unified Development Ordinance.
This ordinance is intended to supplement the City of Richmond Unified Development Ordinance
(UDO). This ordinance is not intended to supersede the UDO except to the extent that the outdated
model floodplain zoning and management provisions are removed and the updated provisions are
incorporated into the new Chapter 153 as set forth within this ordinance.

Article 9. Effective Date.
This ordinance shall be in full force and effect on April 2, 2015. (Ordinance No. 4-2015)

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Introduction

The River Vista neighborhood (River Vista) is like many
near downtown neighborhoods in that it has evolved
over the decades from a stable, moderately priced
owner-occupied neighborhood to one with a mix of
rental and owner-occupied homes. The neighborhood
was first developed in the early 1900’s with modest, but
sturdy, middle-class homes. The small yards and narrow
streets speak to the neighborhood development patterns
of the time. The neighborhood provided homes for
residents who wanted detached single-family housing
close to downtown Elkhart. The neighborhood did well
and met the needs of many families until the seventies
when suburban development on the edges of town
drew residents out of the city with larger yards, modern
housing styles and amenities. Over the last forty years,
the neighborhood has seen many of its housing units
divided into apartments and streets clogged with cars
as density per home increased with this new housing
pattern. Although there are a small contingency of stable
homeowners and renters in the neighborhood, the area
has experienced lower home values and lower rents
resulting in disinvestment. The image of the neighborhood
has changed from one of a stable working-class area to
one of low-value and low quality.
However, the future looks bright for River Vista. Elkhart
has followed the national trend of reinvestment and
redevelopment in downtown and near downtown
neighborhoods. The SoMa Implementation Plan sets the
stage for downtown revitalization and includes a strong
emphasis on stabilizing and reinvesting in near downtown
neighborhoods like River Vista. The area has many
challenges but also has great promise due to its proximity
to Downtown Elkhart and the unique natural amenities
offered by the St. Joseph River. The River Vista Plan
was commissioned to look at both the challenges and
strengths of the area and chart a course forward that will

capitalize on the area’s unique amenities and location.
This report recommends a Greenspace Strategy inside
the floodway and a Neighborhood Revitalization
Strategy outside the floodway.
Greenspace Strategy goals are designed to eliminate
residential uses, improve and expand greenspace
amenities and attract appropriate commercial
development.
Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy goals strive
to strengthen the neighborhood’s connection to
downtown, improve and increase housing options and
renew the physical appearance of the neighborhood.

Previous Studies
Previous studies of River Vista conducted by
Development Concepts, Inc. (DCI) and RW Armstrong
provide a foundation for this report. In January
2003, DCI completed a Redevelopment Action Plan
for the neighborhood. Redevelopment principles
focused on open space upgrades, enhancing public
riverfront access, public improvements, connectivity to
downtown, diversifying housing options and preserving
historic structures; these principles remain applicable
today.
RW Armstrong’s Preliminary Engineering Study,
completed December 2011, was conducted to
investigate if the floodway area had been overestimated. Before creating a redevelopment plan,
it was critical to confirm the exact area impacted
by the very strict development restrictions set within
the floodway. This Study concluded that the current
floodway delineation was in fact accurate and that
the redevelopment options within that portion of the
neighborhood would be greatly restricted.

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE

Existing Conditions
The St. Joseph River defines River Vista with both
its positive aspects of river front amenities but also
its restrictions due to the floodway. River Vista is
bordered by North Main Street to the east, Lexington
Avenue to the south and the St. Joseph River to the
west and north. It is predominantly residential and has
only a few commercial, institutional, and multifamily
structures - many of which are along Main, 2nd and
3rd Streets.
Approximately one-third of the neighborhood is in
the floodway, one-third is in the flood fringe and
one-third is not affected by flooding. The Map on
page 4 illustrates the flood zones in the River Vista
neighborhood and the areas of the neighborhood that
will be included in the two development strategies.
Socioeconomic data confirms that River Vista has
experienced disinvestment over the past decades. An
increase in renter occupied housing units, lower home
values and lower than median household incomes
are all indicators of this trend. Neighborhoods
experiencing disinvestment have difficulty in attracting
new residents and investors because the return on
investment is below market returns. These issues
are further complicated by the flood regulations
and the need to obtain expensive “high-risk” flood
insurance due to the floodway designation in a
portion of the neighborhood. These factors, along
with lower property values make it very difficult to
obtain financing to purchase or renovate residential
properties in this neighborhood and cause even more
disinvestment.
The neighborhood also suffers from a negative
reputation fueled by a number of abandoned and
dilapidated homes. The area does provide affordable
housing units and not all of them are in poor
conditions. The Map on page 4 indicates that there
are a substantial number of owner-occupied units in
River Vista and a review of existing housing conditions
indicate that although there are homes that have been
neglected and are in disrepair, there is a group of
residents (both homeowner and rental) that take care
of their property. It is important as we plan for the
future of River Vista that we take into consideration
the current residents and how they could be supported
in making and maintaining their investment in the
neighborhood.

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE

St. Joseph River Floodway
Records indicate that the residential structures in
this neighborhood experienced major flooding in
1908, 1950 and 1982. Many of the structures in
the floodway are in poor condition, due in part to
regulatory constraints.
The St. Joseph River floodway is very unusual in that
the floodway and the 100-year floodplain have the
same recognized boundaries. This can cause a bit of
confusion when discussing related development issues
and regulations. For the purpose of this report, the
term “floodway” is synonymous with the boundaries of
the Greenspace Development Area with the exception
of Section 21, Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay
District in the Elkhart Zoning Ordinance (See Appendix
A).

Supporting Our Main Assets (SoMa)
The River Vista Development Strategy Update has
been prepared simultaneously with SoMa Downtown
Planning efforts. By supporting downtown cultural
attractions, recreational amenities, and the residential
fabric, the City of Elkhart is reviving a sense of
community pride, improving the quality of life for its
residents, and providing an environment to attract and
sustain new business investment.
SoMa’s event coordination and marketing goals will
help to promote the neighborhood and highlight
area amenities. In addition, Downtown Elkhart, Inc.
(DEI) will become SoMa’s real estate development
and management organization. DEI is committed to
investing in real estate development projects in River
Vista. The organization currently has two projects
underway that will provide nine fully-renovated
apartments in the neighborhood with plans to acquire
and renovate additional units in the near future.
This investment in the neighborhood and the SoMa
downtown revitalization efforts will certainly benefit
River Vista and its current and future residents.

6

RiverWalk Culture Trail
The RiverWalk Culture Trail is SoMa’s recreational
spine that will expand to connect all major cultural
destinations and parks. Public art will also enhance
the trail at visually engaging areas. Currently the
RiverWalk is contained to the east side of Main Street.
Connecting the River Vista trail to the RiverWalk
Culture Trail will improve downtown connectivity to
River Vista, St. Joseph River and other neighborhoods
to the west. This improved connectivity will help
shape redevelopment of this neighborhood as it is
reestablished as a vibrant neighborhood that can
offer residents and visitors stunning river views, a large
river front park system and greenway, access to water
recreation and lower density residential options for
downtown living. See RiverWalk Culture Trail Map on
page 9.

DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS

Strategies

The strategies in this report focus on both
mitigating future flood losses in the floodway, and
neighborhood development outside of the floodway.
The Greenspace Strategy focuses on establishing
active and passive open space in the floodway since
it is the most effective way to diminish future flood
losses. Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy is the
neighborhood redevelopment strategy and focuses
on stabilizing and improving the two-thirds of the
neighborhood not impacted by floodway restrictions.
• Greenspace Strategy goals are designed to
eliminate residential uses, improve and expand
greenspace amenities and attract appropriate
commercial development.
• Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy goals
strive to strengthen the neighborhood’s
connection to downtown, improve and increase
housing options and renew the physical
appearance of the neighborhood.

Greenspace Strategy
The Greenspace Strategy calls for an enhanced public
park and greenway expansion. As older structures
within the floodway become obsolete the park would
continue to expand as property is acquired. The
greenspace strategy inside the floodway intends to:
• Eliminate residential uses
• Improve and expand greenspace amenities
• Attract appropriate commercial development
• Provide a variety of recreational amenities
• Make the riverfront accessible
• Enhance open views to the river

10

The River Vista Greenspace Strategy area is
represented in Exhibit 1. The area is consistent with
the St. Joseph River Floodway with the exception of
properties to the east of 3rd Street along Pottawatomi
Drive. The Pottawatomi Drive area is a good mix of
owner-occupied and rental units that are generally
in good condition and are well managed. This area
continues to offer stable, quality housing units in the
neighborhood even though they are located within the
floodway.
The River Vista neighborhood is very unusual in
that the St. Joseph River Floodway and the100-year
Floodplain in the area have the same recognized
boundaries. This can cause a bit of confusion when
discussing related development issues and regulations.
For the purpose of this report, the term “floodway”
is synonymous with the area represented as future
greenspace development on page 4, Exhibit 1 with
the exception of Section 21, Special Flood Hazard
Area Overlay District in the Elkhart Zoning Ordinance
(See Appendix A). The floodway is characterized
by fast moving water and is therefore the most
dangerous area in the floodplain. The flood fringe
is characterized by steady and slow moving water
during and after a flood. The redevelopment options
presented in this Plan will respect the regulations
imposed by the district that are defined by the Federal
Insurance Rate Map.
The intent of the Special Flood Hazard Area
Overlay District is to:
• Prevent unwise developments from increasing
flood or drainage hazards to others;
• Maintain property values and a stable tax base
by minimizing the potential for creating flood

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE
development of the floodway redevelopment strategy
outlined in this Plan.
All structures and parcels in the floodway are to some
degree restricted from making improvements or any
new construction. Structures that do not impede
floodwater are generally accepted as uses that can
be constructed in the floodway. Such structures
include most park and recreation structures, such
as open pavilions, trail overlooks and playgrounds.
In large part the future of River Vista depends on
the City’s continuing efforts to prepare land for
future greenspace and private investment, given the
additional costs and property limitations incurred by
the regulatory constraints of the Special Flood Hazard
Area Overlay District.
RiverWalk overlooks similar to these can be placed along the
proposed River Vista Greenway.

damaged areas, and
• Make federally subsidized flood insurance
available for property in the City of Elkhart by
fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Heavy and violent flooding that occurs within floodways is a threat to real property, human life, health
and safety. Records indicate that the residential
structures in this neighborhood experienced major
flooding in 1908, 1950 and 1982. Many of the
structures in the floodway are in poor condition, due
in part to regulatory constraints.
The City of Elkhart is committed to reducing these
risks in the St. Joseph River Floodway. The key
to the proposed redevelopment strategy is that
residential uses will be eliminated from the floodway
and replaced with greenspace and commercial
businesses that complement the natural area and
river development. The redevelopment strategy for
the area outside of the floodway concentrates on
improving housing conditions and growing small
business development.
To this end, the regulations limit the extent of its
revitalization. By law, residential property owners
are limited to improving their home if it increases
in value by more than 50% and the City’s federal
funding resources may not be used to redevelop
properties in the floodway. These regulatory limitations
prevent residential improvements and development
in the floodway area and are the key factor in the

GOAL 1
Continue with Acquisition and DemolitionMany of the properties in the floodway should be
acquired to accommodate open space for flood
mitigation. The City of Elkhart anticipates acquisition
and demolition will be a slow and judicious process
limited by funding constraints, project phasing, and
property ownership. City staff will continue work with
Elkhart County to acquire tax delinquent properties
as these are generally the properties in the area
that have been abandoned and are in the worst
condition. By eliminating these blighted properties,
the City will continue the flood mitigation project and
remove these dilapidated buildings at the same time
providing a dual benefit to the neighborhood. The
Map on page 4 identifies the properties that have
been acquired by the City for this project. The City is
making progress towards removing blighted structures
and developing the area as a greenspace amenity for
the neighborhood and the City as a whole.
Priorities for property acquisition include:
• Tax delinquent properties;
• Properties that have been condemned by the
City of Elkhart; and
• Properties along the St. Joseph River
The acquisition of well-maintained homes, whether
owner-occupied or rental, will be the lowest priority
unless the property is critical for the development of a
public improvement such as the RiverWalk or public
park.

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE
GOAL 2
Implement Park and Greenway Master Plan
for the Property within the Floodway - As
property in the floodway is acquired by the City, the
land should become an extension of Elkhart’s Park
and Greenway System. Master plan improvements
will be phased and should begin by establishing
streetscape connectivity from Langle Park to the Island
Park Bridge on Sycamore Street. Phase 2 includes
enhancements to Langle Park and incorporates a
new greenway; Phase 3 will improve the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) boat launch
and expand the greenway system; and Phase 4 will
extend the Greenway Trail across the Lexington Street
Bridge to the west bank of the St. Joseph River.

Phase 1
Estimated Completion 2014 (Simultaneous to North
Main Street streetscape improvements)
Connect Langle Park to Island Park via
Sycamore Street - The growing energy behind
SoMa presents a timely and unique opportunity to
expand the RiverWalk Trail west of Main Street, thereby
connecting Island Park to Langle Park along Sycamore
Street. This connection along Sycamore Street would
be made with streetscape improvements to create
a clear and welcoming axis encouraging residents
and visitors to explore both riverfronts east and
west of Main Street. The streetscape design should
also conform to the general design standards used
on North Main Street and extend along St. Joseph
River and connect to the RiverWalk Culture Trail via
Sycamore Street.

Phase 2
Estimated Completion 2015
Upgrade Langle Park and Incorporate
Greenway - Upgrades to Langle Park will increase
the functionality and active use of the existing park
with new soccer fields, picnic shelters, a trailhead and
restrooms. As the City acquires enough property for
expansion south of Langle Park more soccer fields
can be created. If the community’s needs change,
alternative programs should be incorporated. The

12

existing playground and basketball courts will also
be improved and/or repositioned in the park. A new
greenway will begin at Langle Park, extend along the
St. Joseph River and connect to the RiverWalk Culture
Trail via Sycamore Street.

Phase 3
Estimated Completion 2016
Improve the IDNR Boat Launch and Extend
Greenway Trail to Lexington Avenue - To
become an outstanding downtown fishing destination
the IDNR boat launch needs to be improved. Simple
improvements would increase the presence of the
boat launch by clearing brush, basic landscaping,
providing picnic tables, repaving the parking lot
and establishing wayfinding signage from Lexington
Avenue and Main Street. The Parks and Recreation
Department (Parks Department) and IDNR may also
consider coordinating a boat rental program through
the SoMa Management Group. Depending on the
popularity of the boat launch and the greenway,
the Parks Department may consider establishing an
IDNR boat launch trailhead. Lastly, the Greenway that
begins in Langle Park will extend along the St. Joseph
River to Lexington Avenue.

Phase 4
Estimated Completion 2018
Complete Greenway Expansion Along
Riverside Drive Park on the West Bank of
St. Joseph River - This is the final phase of the
greenway expansion that will connect the western
side of the St. Joseph River to all downtown parks.
Depending on the trails context, distinct elements such
as docks, outlooks, seating areas, trail heads, and
other park elements should be incorporated.
GOAL 3
Encourage Appropriate Commercial
Development that will Complement
the Riverfront Amenities - Commercial
redevelopment is most suitable for Main, 2nd and
3rd Streets. Attracting commercial uses to Main Street

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE
should be the priority for the neighborhood because
it is the most heavily trafficked street and is part of the
larger effort to revitalize downtown through the SoMa
Implementation Plan. Commercial development that
complements riverfront and greenspace amenities is
also suitable for River Vista. The floodway regulations
restrict residential uses in the area but do permit for
non-residential uses as long as the building footprint
is not modified. This opens up the potential for
redevelopment of some of the exiting residential
homes in River Vista for commercial ventures. They
would complement the greenspace and river front and
provide a wonderful amenity to the neighborhood.
Residential buildings could be converted into shops,
such as:
• bait shop
• gift shop
• concession stand
• restaurant
• boat, kayak, canoe, paddle boat rental
• pavilion or other shelter space
Other destination based businesses that do not rely
upon traffic or visibility may consider locating in River
Vista, such as a stamp collector, tailor, or computer
technician. The following properties have been
identified for this type of redevelopment opportunities.
This is just a preliminary list of potential sites based on
location and structure. This is not an all inclusive list
nor does it indicate the City will acquire the property.
Potential Sites for Commercial Redevelopment:
• 6th Street
• Jefferson Street
• Sherman Street
• Washington Street

Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy
The Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy for the
portion of River Vista outside the floodway will build
upon existing efforts to improve Main Street, connect
Elkhart’s cultural amenities, and cherish Elkhart’s
historic character.
The Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy
outside the floodway intends to:
• Improve image of the neighborhood by
residents and visitors
• Strengthen the neighborhood’s connection to
downtown

• Improve and increase housing options and
opportunities
• Renew the physical appearance
• Make needed infrastructure improvements
• Investigate the viability of existing commercial
uses on North Main Street
GOAL 1
Promote community participation - This plan
promotes the involvement its residents, property
owners and downtown advocates in meaningful
dialogue about the goals of the plan and activities that
will accomplish these goals. This process will help to
reintroduce the neighborhood to the community and
it residents in an attempt to counteract the negative
perception of this neighborhood as an undesirable
place. The City of Elkhart will assist in promoting River
Vista Neighborhood and repositioning the area as a
desirable near downtown neighborhood for current
and future residents.
GOAL 2
Take advantage of the SoMa Movement
to market neighborhood and improve the
neighborhood identity – The vision for the
River Vista neighborhood highlights the proximity to
downtown and the energy of the SoMa Initiative to
make significant change in the physical environment
as well as the image of the neighborhood. These
changes will be successful because the redevelopment
of the neighborhood will be closely linked with the
SoMa Marketing program. Over the past several
decades, outsiders have defined the neighborhood
as an unattractive place. This initiative will provide
technical support from SoMa Marketing staff to
work with stakeholders in redefining River Vista and
communicating the goals outlined in this Plan. The
neighborhood will take the lead and promote the
vision of River Vista as a welcoming neighborhood
known for its natural amenities, proximity to downtown
and variety of housing options.
GOAL 3
Improve Code Compliance Through
Increased Enforcement - City staff will work
to increase enforcement of the City’s Property
Maintenance Code in the area. Property owners
outside of the floodway in violation of the Code

15

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE
will be required to make needed improvements in
a timely fashion to counter the perception of the
area as abandoned or dilapidated. Enforcement of
code issues related to properties within the floodway
will require that not only the property maintenance
codes are followed but that a review of flood zone
restrictions is also conducted to determine an
appropriate plan for compliance.
GOAL 4
Establish a Voluntary Certified Housing
Code Inspection Program - Once the SoMa
Voluntary Inspection and Certification Program (SoMa
Certified) has been established it should also be
used in the River Vista Neighborhood. This program
will be designed to promote better maintenance of
properties in Downtown Elkhart and surrounding
neighborhoods and may have financial incentives
for participation. Recognition as a SoMa Certified
property may encourage River Vista community
pride and influence property owners to improve their
property maintenance standards. City Staff and the
neighborhood association can promote this standard
when it becomes available.
GOAL 5
Improve the Quality of Rental Housing Units
- In addition to increased code compliance efforts
and the Voluntary Housing Code Inspection Program,
an incentive program may be needed to facilitate
redevelopment in the area. The City should work with
DEI and other organizations and lending institutions to
investigate an incentive program that might alleviate
the rehabilitation gap for rental property owners and
other development barriers in the area. The SoMa
Plan outlines potential development incentives. These
tools should be promoted and used in River Vista
to encourage development and improve housing
conditions.
GOAL 6
Rehabilitate Owner-Occupied Structures The City, through its Redevelopment Commission, has
an existing Owner-Occupied Housing Rehabilitation
Program. City staff will work with the neighborhood
association to promote this program with qualified
homeowners in the neighborhood. This program will
support existing and future homeowners in making
improvements that will stabilize residential property
values.

16

GOAL 7
Research the Feasibility of a Multi-Family
Residential Development - Older single-family
structures require more maintenance than a new home
and these needs are often delayed if renter-occupied.
Current housing occupancy data suggests that there
is a demand for quality, affordable rental housing in
the neighborhood. A study should be performed to
research the feasibility of developing new multi-family
residential in the neighborhood.
GOAL 8
Develop Infill Residential on City-Owned
Lots - The City of Elkhart through the Community
Development Division has done a very good job
of stabilizing the neighborhood by demolishing
and clearing blighted properties that were beyond
reasonable repair. The City currently controls, through
its Redevelopment Commission, several cleared
vacant lots within the neighborhood that present an
excellent opportunity for new residential infill housing.
Additionally, privately owned lots are also available
in the area. The combined efforts of the public
and private sectors will be required to rebuild the
neighborhood fabric.
GOAL 9
Research Two-Way Streets - The current oneway streets along 2nd and 3rd Streets may better
serve residential traffic needs and complement the
character of River Vista if they were redesigned as
two-way streets. By re-introducing two-way traffic,
the residential and pedestrian nature of the area will
be enhanced. Creating a two-way street system limits
vehicular speed and the “cut-through” nature of the
existing one-way system. It may also improve the
commercial viability of property outside the floodway.
This research should be conducted simultaneously
with proposed two-way street evaluations for the other
areas of Downtown Elkhart.
GOAL 10
Monitor Combined Sewer Overflow
Discharge - The City is working on eliminating
and/or reducing its combined sewer overflow (CSO)
discharges. The CSO outfall near Langle Park is only
activated under heavy rain or snow melting conditions
based on the City’s CSO modeling and discharge
records. Since this CSO will remain in place for some

RIVER VISTA DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY UPDATE

time, human health and safety signage should be
maintained at the combined sewer overflow location.
Designated fishing areas should be located upstream
of the CSO outfall along the proposed River Vista
Greenway.
GOAL 11
Investigate the viability of existing
commercial uses on North Main Street Review existing commercial uses along the corridor
adjacent to the River Vista neighborhood. Determine
what properties along Main Street could be candidates
for expansion opportunities. Review which properties
are underutilized and could attract new commercial
reuses that support both needs of North Main Street
and the adjacent River Vista neighborhood markets.

SECTION 21
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS FOR ELKHART, INDIANA

Article 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives.
Section A. Statutory Authorization.
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and IC 14-28-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common
Council of the City of Elkhart does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
Section B. Findings of Fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the City of Elkhart are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy
in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
Section C. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific
areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property
due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and,

APPENDIX A

(6) Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their
contents in the City by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Section D. Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
floodplains;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas, and;
(7) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
Article 2. General Provisions.
Section A. Lands to Which This Ordinance Applies.
This ordinance shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) and known flood
prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Elkhart.
Section B. Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data.
This ordinance’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available
regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available
data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data
with better data and submit it to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review
and approval.
(1) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied
Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the City of
Elkhart shall be as delineated on the one-percent annual chance flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study of Elkhart County and Incorporated Areas dated
August 2, 2011 and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and dated
August 2, 2011.

APPENDIX A

(2) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the
remaining Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) within the jurisdiction of the
City of Elkhart, delineated as an "A Zone" on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) of Elkhart County and Incorporated Areas prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and dated August 2, 2011, shall be
according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site
is greater than one square mile.
(3) In the absence of a published Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood
elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s
known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the
upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
Section C. Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit.
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions
of this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities the Special
Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).
Section D. Compliance.
No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within
the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) without full compliance with the terms of this
ordinance and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the Special Flood
Hazard Area (SFHA) shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of
this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Section E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
Section F. Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground
Elevations.
(1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain with in
the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on the Federal Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM), and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) profiles shall govern.
(2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site
shall be included in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and regulated
accordingly.
(3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood
elevation, that site shall be considered outside the Special Flood Hazard Area

APPENDIX A

(SFHA) and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner
should be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
Section G. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements; and
(2) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes.
Section H. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and
scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this ordinance does not create any liability on the part of the City of Elkhart,
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
Section I. Penalties for Violation.
Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with
the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall
be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. All violations shall be considered a
common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the
Zoning Code for the City of Elkhart. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not
exceeding two-thousand, five hundred dollars ($2500.00).
(1) A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation
continues to exist.
(2) The City of Elkhart shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered
a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a
Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
(3) Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action to
prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to
the person or persons responsible.
Article 3. Administration.
Section A. Designation of Administrator.
The Common Council of Elkhart hereby appoints the Planning Department to administer
and implement the provisions of this ordinance, and to designate an individual as the
Floodplain Administrator. In the Floodplain Administrator’s absence, he or she shall
designate an individual to administer and implement the provisions of this ordinance.

APPENDIX A

Section B. Permit Procedures.
Application for a Floodplain Development Permit shall be made to the Floodplain
Administrator prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to,
the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen fill,
storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
Specifically the following information is required:
(1) Application stage.
a). A description of the proposed development;
b). Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately locate
property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;
c). A legal description of the property site;
d). A site development plan showing existing and proposed development
locations and existing and proposed land grades;
e). Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed
buildings. Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD;
f).

Elevation (in NAVD 88 or NGVD) to which any non-residential
structure will be
floodproofed; and

g). Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development, and;
(2) Construction stage.
Upon placement of the lowest floor; or floodproofing, it shall be the duty of
the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a
certification of the NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor
or floodproofed elevation, as built. Said certification shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same.
When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure said
certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of
a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any
work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holders’ risk. (The Floodplain Administrator shall
review the lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data
submitted.) The permit holder shall correct deficiencies detected
by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed.
Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections
required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project.

c). The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by
vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the
slopes shall be no steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical.
d). The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto
neighboring properties.
e). The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG.
(6)

Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:
a). The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the Flood Protection Grade
(FPG) and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation

APPENDIX A

system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site;
(i) outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
(ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
(iii)

in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or

(iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of
a flood.
b). The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above
grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been
substantially damaged by a flood.
c). Manufactured homes with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and
exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls as required for elevated structures in Article 4, Section
B(4).
d). Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
(i) be on site for less than 180 days; and,
(ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions); or
(iii) meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated earlier in
this section.
Section C. Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
(1)

All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;

(2)

All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood
damage;

APPENDIX A

(3)

All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards, and;

(4)

Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other
proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions),
which is greater than the lesser of fifty lots or five acres.

Section D. Critical Facility.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the
limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical
facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the
Flood Protection Grade (FPG) at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into
floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.
Section E. Standards for Identified Floodways.
Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), established in Article 2, Section B,
are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due
to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion
potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require
the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications,
to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction
in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway
from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a
local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity
located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the
structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing
(lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction
of non-substantial additions/ improvements to residences in a non-boundary river
floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an
addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit) for
the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit (when applicable)
has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been
issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator
may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in
Article 4 of this ordinance have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot
be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations
(if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or

APPENDIX A

future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot; and
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City shall
submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
revise the regulatory flood data.
Section F. Standards for Identified Fringe.
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue
the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Article 4 of
this ordinance have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any
new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the Flood Protection Grade
(FPG).
Section G.
Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) Without
Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodways/Fringes.
(1)

Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe
have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is
greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and
comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for
construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the
one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection
Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction
in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed
development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the
conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the
conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the
provisions contained in Article 4 of this ordinance have been met.

(2)

Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe
have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less
than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to
provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and onepercent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 4 of this
ordinance have been met.

(3)

The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood

APPENDIX A

more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood
damages.
Section H. Standards for Flood Prone Areas.
All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no
FEMA published map is available, shall meet general standards as required per Article
4, Section A (1) through (10).
Article 5. Variance Procedures.
Section A. Designation of Variance and Appeals Board.
The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the Common Council of Elkhart shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this Section of
the Zoning Ordinance.
Section B. Duties of Variance and Appeals Board.
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this ordinance. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may
appeal such decision to any of the Elkhart County Superior Courts, or the Elkhart County
Circuit Court.
Section C. Variance Procedures.
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this
ordinance, and;
(1) The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(2) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(3) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
(4) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(5) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(6) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(7) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;

APPENDIX A

(8) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
(9) The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport
of the floodwaters at the site; and,
(10) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions,
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
Section D. Conditions for Variances.
(1)

Variances shall only be issued when there is:
a). A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b). A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and,
c). A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing laws or ordinances.

(2)

No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to Article 4,
Section E or Section G (1) of this ordinance may be granted.

(3)

Any variance granted in a floodway subject to Article 4, Section E or
Section G (1) of this ordinance will require a permit from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.

(4)

Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of Article 4,
Section B, may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.

(5)

Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(6)

Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any
structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the
Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.

(7)

Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to
which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation (See Article 5, Section E).

(8)

The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the

APPENDIX A

Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See Article 5, Section
E).
Section E. Variance Notification.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the
signature of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and;
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the
Office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community’s
biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Section F. Historic Structure.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Section G. Special Conditions.
Upon the consideration of the factors listed in Article 5, and the purposes of this
ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
See also amended Section 29.9 B.

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives.

A. Statutory Authorization.
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their
zoning jurisdictions.
B. Findings of Fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the City of Carmel zoning jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all
of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood
heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
C. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards,
which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction.
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
Flood Hazard Areas
Page 1
as adopted per Z-592-14; Effective November 17, 2014

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
(6) Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the City’s zoning
jurisdiction by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
D. Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) To protect human life and health.
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
expense of the general public.
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and
sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains.
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in
such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
Chapter 2.

Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the
meaning they have in common usage and to give this Ordinance its most reasonable application. However, the
following definitions only apply to this Article of the Zoning and City Code. Words not defined herein but defined in
the Carmel City Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted in accordance with the Chapter 10, Article 1, Chapter 3.
A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant
threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and
Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below:
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic
analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event determined
by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised
maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on
sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of
ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.

Flood Hazard Areas
Page 2
as adopted per Z-592-14; Effective November 17, 2014

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is
determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but which will
ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are
areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system,
such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be
used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base
flood elevations or depths are shown.
Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area one hundred and twenty (120) square
feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to
the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used
for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are
detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds
Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the
addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is
connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this ordinance.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with
base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow.
Base Flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent annual chance flood.
Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.
Community Rating System (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide
incentives for those communities in the Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.
Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities
include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations,
installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to:

"Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as
painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve
filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.
Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by
means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or
columns (posts and piers).
Elevation Certificate is a certified statement that verifies a structure’s elevation information.

first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in the City before the effective date of the
initial FIRM.
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the
construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed before the effective date of the City’s first floodplain ordinance.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the
construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the
overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory
floodway.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of the City, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas

Floodplain means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or
hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for
reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including
but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open
space plans.
Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control
development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof,
which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are
also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain
management requirements.
Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces.
Floodproofing certificate is a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an alternative to
elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect.
Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are
reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or
stream.
Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of
floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated for the base flood.
Fringe is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to
grant the requested variance. The City of Carmel Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional.
Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through
other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to
build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction,
next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana
State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the
minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood
damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any
combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1,
1997, will include ICC coverage.

Letter of Final Determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update process which
establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the City. The LFD initiates the sixmonth adoption period. The City must adopt or amend its floodplain management regulations during this six-month
period unless the City has previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to
FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map

Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the currently effective FEMA map
that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation
data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued
by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations.
Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP
map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated
on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio,
deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure.
Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following:
(1) The top of the lowest level of the structure.

(3) The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure.
(4) The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
(5) The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure where the walls
of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
a) the walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for
the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and
windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area, each shall
have openings on exterior walls;
b) the total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1) square inch for every one square foot of enclosed
area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and,
c) such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access.
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis
and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more
manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as
established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified
appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards
and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of
disaster response and recovery.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of
property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the
private insurance industry.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for

other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by
the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
One-percent annual chance flood is the flood that has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance flood. See
“Regulatory Flood”.
Physical Map Revision (PMR) is an official republication of a City’s zoning jurisdiction FEMA map to effect changes
to base (1-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and
planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations
resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of the City’s zoning jurisdiction,
neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary
manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

(4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
Regular program means the phase of the City’s participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain
management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and
elevations determined in a FIS.
Regulatory flood means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year,
as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as
defined in Chapter 3 (B) of this ordinance. The "Regulatory Flood" is also known by the term "Base Flood”, “OnePercent Annual Chance Flood”, and “100-Year Flood”.
Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood
insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly
constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws,
regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in floodprone areas.
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the City subject to inundation by the
regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Carmel are generally identified as such on the Hamilton County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 19, 2014 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These
areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes
a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational
vehicles to be installed on a site for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure
to it’s before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial
damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic
structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure".
Suspension means the removal of the City from the NFIP because the City has not enacted and/or enforced the
proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner
otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in practical difficulty.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this ordinance. A
structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters
flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may
occur.
X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent
FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of
being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where
the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
Zone means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
Zone A (see definition for A zone)
Zone B, C, and X means areas identified as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood
in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with
inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by
regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream
drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party must replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards.
To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review
subsequently approved.
(3) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood
elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse within the City’s zoning jurisdiction’s known flood
prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
H. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this Ordinance does not create any liability on the part of the City of Carmel, the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this Ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
I. Penalties for Violation.
Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a
Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this Ordinance. All
violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
34 of the Zoning Code for the City of Carmel. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding Five Hundred
($500.00) Dollars. A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist. Nothing
herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

Chapter 4.

A. General Standards.
In all SFHAs and known flood prone areas the following provisions are required:
(1) New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure.
(2) Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
(3) New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment
resistant to flood damage below the FPG.
(4) New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize
flood damage.
(5) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, utility meters, and other service
facilities shall be located at/above the FPG or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating

lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood
protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and
exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs must meet the
following minimum criteria:
a) Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two (2) exterior walls (having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area).
b) The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade
immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher.
c) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
d) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage
door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior
door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).

h) Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/venting affidavit acknowledging that all
openings will be maintained as flood vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any
way will violate the requirements of Chapter 5, Section B (4). Periodic inspections will be conducted by
the Floodplain Administrator to ensure compliance. The affidavit shall be recorded in the office of the
Hamilton County Recorder.
i)

Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the structure’s deed a non-conversion
agreement declaring that the area below the lowest floor (where the interior height of the enclosure
exceeds six (6) feet) or the detached accessory building shall not be improved, finished or otherwise
converted; the City will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. The non-conversion agreement shall be
recorded in the office of the Hamilton County Recorder.

(5) Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent
land fill in accordance with the following:
a) The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than 1 foot deep before compacting to ninety five (95%)
percent of the maximum density obtainable with either the Standard or Modified Proctor Test method,
which shall be retained in permit file.
b) The fill shall extend five (5) feet beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the BFE.
c) The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or
bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three (3) feet horizontal to one
(1) foot vertical.
d) The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
e) The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG.

(6) Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days
must meet one of the following requirements:
a) These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site outside a manufactured home
park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood:
(i) The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall
be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
(ii) Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed
to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in
Chapter 5, Section B (4).

Flood Hazard Areas

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

b) These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood:
(i) The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is
supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than thirty six (36) inches
in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
(ii) Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed
to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in
Chapter 5, Section B (4).
c) Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
(i) be on site for less than one hundred and eighty (180) days; or,
(ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions); or
(iii) meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated earlier in this section.
(7) Accessory Structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing standards may be granted for accessory
structures. Such structures must meet the following standards:
a) Shall not be used for human habitation.
b) Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials.
c) Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
d) Shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development
(including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of fifty (50) lots or five
(5) acres.
(5) All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit density of development
permitted in the SFHA.
(6) All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially
emergency responders).
D. Critical Facility.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available.
Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released
into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent
possible.
E. Standards for Identified Floodways.
Located within SFHAs, established in Chapter 3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion
potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and
apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a
floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit
for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land
preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction
of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a
non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1allows construction of a non-substantial addition/ improvement to a
residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing
grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has
been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once
a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions
contained in Chapter 5 of this ordinance have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive
than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, the
City’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, that will
adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an
increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway
condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City shall submit the data and request that
the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found
at 44 CFR § 65.12.

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

F. Standards for Identified Fringe.
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Chapter 5 of this Ordinance have been met. The key
provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the
FPG.
G. Standards for SFHAs without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodways/Fringes.
(1) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been
determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway
permit (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway permit
(including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed
development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain
Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the provisions contained in Chapter 5 of this ordinance have been met.
(2) Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been
determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the
floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the
provisions contained in Chapter 5 of this Ordinance have been met.
(3) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
H. Standards for Flood Prone Areas.
All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is
available, shall meet applicable standards as required per Chapter 5.
Chapter 6.

(7) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that
area.
(8) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
(9) The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site.
(10) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
D. Conditions for Variances.
(1) Variances shall only be issued when there is:
a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship.
c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public,
or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
(2) No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to Chapter 5, Sections E or G (1) of this Ordinance
may be granted.

as adopted per Z-592-14; Effective November 17, 2014

CITY OF CARMEL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS ORDINANCE

(4) Variances to the Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction of Chapter 5, Section B, may be granted only when a
new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(6) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
(7) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between
the Flood Protection Grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of
the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation (See Chapter 6, Section E).
(8) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (See
Chapter 6, Section E).
E. Variance Notification.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the flood
protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a City official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood protection grade will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as Twenty Five Dollars ($25.00) for One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and;
(2) Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks to life and property.
The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
F. Historic Structure.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure” and the
variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
G. Special Conditions.
Upon the consideration of the factors listed in Chapter 6, and the purposes of this Ordinance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may attach such conditions per I.C. 36-7-4-1015, to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this ordinance.
