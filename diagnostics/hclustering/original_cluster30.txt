Current news and helpful tips from Carmel Utilities

Don’t flush that wipe!

Carmel Utilities is a proud
sponsor of the Carmel
Green Teens Micro-grant
Program. This teen group
offers grants for youth-led
environmental projects in
Carmel. Up to $1000 is available to fund youth-led
volunteer eco-friendly projects in Carmel or Clay
Township. Applications are due February 29, 2016.
Awards will be distributed by March 31, 2016, in plenty
of time for Earth Day or Arbor Day projects.

Class action and individual
lawsuits have been filed in
courts around the country
against the manufacturers
of so called “flushable”
wipes. The packaging of
many wipes state that
they are flushable; but most
times they are not.
Unfortunately, the majority of wipes on the market
don’t biodegrade quickly
enough to avoid clogging
pipes. Toilet paper disintegrates almost immediately,
but disposable wipes wreak havoc on sewer systems.

Sample projects include:
• planting trees (to reduce CO2)
• purchasing and distributing rain barrels, recycling
		 containers, or compost bins

After being flushed, many times wipes get caught in
a home’s plumbing system. Once stuck, wipes eventually
create a blockage. Other things catch on and the next
thing the homeowner knows is that they are calling
a plumber and paying a few hundred dollars to get their
drain snaked.

• creating organic community or school gardens or
		 compost bins

If a wipe does make its way through the home’s plumbing
system, it can make it all the way to the lift stations or
wastewater treatment plant where they just wrap themselves around the equipment. This results in damaged
equipment and additional repair and maintenance expense.

Projects must be designed
and carried out by young
people, with adults serving
as “guides on the side.”

Carmel Utilities thanks you
for not flushing that wipe!

• hosting roadside and waterways clean-up events
• educational campaigns to encourage carbon reduction
• any green youth-driven project, be creative

School, scout, religious and
other youth groups are
encouraged to apply.

Prepare Your Home For Winter Weather
If you are traveling during periods of
cold weather, you may want to take
the following precautions in addition
to the ones above.

Winter weather is here and the City of Carmel Utilities
would like to remind you to take precautions to protect
the plumbing in your home from freezing during
extremely cold temperatures.
• If you have pipes along
an outside wall allow a
small trickle of water to
run at night to keep the
pipes from freezing. The
cost of the extra water
is low compared to a
frozen pipe.

• If you live in a single family home
consider turning off the water
to your house at the meter.
In Carmel usually the meter
is located in a pit by the front
sidewalk.

• Open cabinet doors to expose pipes along outside walls
to warmer room temperatures.
• Know where your main water shut-off valve is. If a pipe
freezes or breaks, shut the water off immediately.
• Keep your garage door closed whenever possible
during cold spells.
• Insulate both hot and cold water pipes in an area
that is likely to freeze since hot water pipes have
a tendency to freeze first.

• Make arrangements with a friend or neighbor to
periodically check on your house to make sure the
heat is working.
• Never turn off your heat or turn the thermostat
below 60 degrees.
• Turn down the temperature on your hot water heater
to save energy but do not turn the unit off.
If your pipes do freeze it is quite possible that your water
meter is frozen. Please call Carmel Utilities Customer
Service Department at 317-571-2442 and we will send
someone to unfreeze your water meter for you.

Household Hazardous Waste Collection Site
The average American household generates about 20 pounds of household
hazardous waste each year. For the City of Carmel that adds up to
270 tons of hazardous material that can find its way to our rivers, streams
and groundwater supply if not disposed of properly.
To help prevent ground water contamination the City of Carmel Utilities
operates a household hazardous waste collection site. Disposal privileges
are available to all Carmel residents.

Carmel Household Hazardous Waste Disposal Facility
901 N. Range Line Road (driveway next to the Hagan-Burke Trail)
Sunday & Monday: Closed
Tuesday–Friday: 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.
Saturday: 9 a.m. – Noon
Remember the disposal site when cleaning out your garage, basement,
kitchen or bathrooms and have unwanted household chemicals,
cleaning supplies, oil-based paint, etc.
For a complete list of items accepted,refer to www.carmel.in.gov
under the Utilities Department, Household Hazardous Waste tab.
