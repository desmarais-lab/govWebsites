PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
TRANSPORTATION PLAN INTRODUCTION
Part 4: Transportation Plan is inclusive of vehicular,
bicycle, pedestrian, and mass transportation. The City of
Carmel recognizes that improving and establishing multiple
modes of transportation is essential to further its evolution to
a high quality edge city.
The C3 Plan is the first of its kind to be inclusive of all
mainstream transportation modes. The City is making
the conscious decision to emphasize alternative modes
of transportation to complement traditional vehicular
transportation. Alternative transportation is increasingly
desirable because residents want bicycle and pedestrian
connectivity (e.g. side paths) to local amenities, commuters
want alternatives (e.g. light rail) for travel to work, and
life-style changes are demanding more recreational facilities
(e.g. Monon Greenway).
To address each mode of transportation, this Part is divided
into the following three sections:
1. Thoroughfare Plan............................................ pg 49
2. Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan................. pg 65
3. Transit Plan....................................................... pg 77

Thoroughfare Plan

The Thoroughfare Plan identifies and describes the
recognized street classifications. It also includes the
20-Year Thoroughfare Plan Map which applies those
street classifications to every street in Carmel’s planning
jurisdiction. The application of street classifications is
designed to result in the effective connectivity and efficient
flow of traffic.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan

The Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan identifies and
describes the facilities designed for bicycle and pedestrian
use. It also includes the Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan
Map which denotes where each type of facility is intended to
be installed or maintained to achieve effective connectivity.

Transit Plan

The Transit Plan identifies and describes the transit system
and facilities desired by the City of Carmel. The transit
system is currently in the planning stages, so the content of
this Plan is meant to support the ongoing desire to establish
a commuter line to downtown Indianapolis and intra-city
transportation.

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
THOROUGHFARE PLAN
The City’s 20-Year Thoroughfare Plan focuses on facilities
for motor vehicles, streets, and alternative transportation
systems. The Thoroughfare Plan first identifies and
describes recognized street classifications. It then applies
those street classifications to every street in the City’s
planning jurisdiction on the Thoroughfare Plan Map.

Street Classifications and Descriptions

The following street classifications are used on the
Thoroughfare Plan Map:
1. Residential Street - Lane.................................. pg 50
2. Residential Street - Minor................................. pg 51
3. Residential Street - Major................................. pg 52
4. Collector Street................................................. pg 53
5. Urban Collector Street...................................... pg 54
6. Residential Parkway......................................... pg 55
7. Secondary Parkway.......................................... pg 56
8. Primary Parkway............................................... pg 57
9. Urban Arterial.................................................... pg 58
10. Secondary Arterial............................................ pg 59
11. Primary Arterial................................................. pg 60

Design Priorities: During the design phase of all street
improvement projects, decisions have to be made to best
meet budgetary constraints, timelines, funding cycles,
physical constraints, and political constraints. This section
communicates the primary and secondary priorities for each
street classification. Primary priorities are those that should
not be foregone in design decisions. Secondary priorities are
those that may be considered for compromise, non-inclusion,
or later phases of the project.
Traffic Management Options: This section describes vehicular
traffic management options to consider when improving
a street. The options listed are intended to identify the
most appropriate means to intersect streets, slow traffic (if
appropriate), increase traffic efficiency (when appropriate),
and improve safety.
Effect of Annexation Agreement: Spring Mill Road, Ditch Road,
Shelborne Road and Town Road between 116th and 96th
Streets, and 106th Street between Commerce Drive and
Spring Mill Road, shall be designated as Collector Streets.
No other information in the C3 Plan shall be construed as
superseding this section.

Each of the street classifications listed above has a page
dedicated to describing how it can be used to convey
vehicular traffic and how it fits into the fabric of the City.
Further, the following headings are used, as described below,
to convey the essence of each street classification:
General Description: This section gives a brief description of
why the street classification has been established.
Street Features: This section conveys the primary design
standards that make each street classification unique. The
standards include: right-of-way, maximum number of lanes,
minimum lane width, curbs, sidewalks and paths, on-street
parking, street trees, and buffer plantings.
Typical Cross Section: This section references a typical
cross section illustration of the street classification. The
illustration is intended to portray the purest applied version
of the street. When applied in the real world, variations in
the design maybe necessary.

STREET CLASSIFICATION COMPARISON

THOROUGHFARE PLAN MAP DESCRIPTION

The below table provides a quick reference for comparing
the different street classifications. The information in
the below table mirrors the content in each of the street
classification descriptions on the previous pages.

The Thoroughfare Plan Map (on the next page) applies
a street classification to each street in Carmel’s planning
jurisdiction. The applied street classification represents what
the street will evolve to be over the course of 20 years, not
as it currently exists.
The Thoroughfare Plan Map also denotes where new streets
are necessary to fulfill the C3 Plan’s goals to mitigate
traffic and promote ease of travel by all modes. These
new streets should be viewed as mandatory when land is
being developed adjacent to or inclusive of the new street’s
proposed location.
See the Bike and Pedestrian Facilities Plan for non-vehicular
facility descriptions.

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITY PLAN
The City’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan focuses on
facilities for non-motorized transportation. One primary
purpose for these facilities is to provide an alternative for
people to get where they are going without using their
vehicles (i.e. for commuting). As a result, bicycle and
pedestrian facilities help mitigate traffic throughout the City
while improving the health of residents. Another primary
purpose for bicycle and pedestrian facilities is to provide
a means for people who cannot drive vehicles (e.g. youth,
blind, and seniors) to safely get to local destinations. For
this reason, all bicycle and pedestrian facilities are intended
to accommodate all handicap accessible devices.
The secondary purpose for bicycle and pedestrian facilities
is fitness training and general recreation. People desirous
of a healthy life-style need facilities to safely walk, run,
skate/blade, or cycle. The City of Carmel realizes not all
bicycle and pedestrian facilities are designed for all types
of fitness activities (e.g. fitness cycling is not appropriate
on sidewalks). Therefore, multiple bicycle and pedestrian
facilities may be necessary in the same right-of-way to
accommodate different fitness activities.

Bicycle/Pedestrian Facility Classifications and Descriptions

The following bicycle and pedestrian facility classifications
are used on the Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan Map:
1.

Image Example: This section references images of each
bicycle and pedestrian facility classification. The images
are intended to portray some of the best examples available
in Carmel, but might not represent the purest intent of the
facility. When applied in the real world, variations in the
design may also be necessary.
Design Priorities: During the design phase of all bicycle
and pedestrian facility improvement projects, decisions
have to be made to best meet budgetary constraints,
timelines, funding cycles, physical constraints, and public
opinions. This section communicates the primary and
secondary priorities for each bicycle and pedestrian facility
classification. Primary priorities are those that should not be
foregone in design decisions. Secondary priorities are those
that maybe considered for compromise, non-inclusion, or
later phases.
Safety Enhancements: This section describes bicycle and
pedestrian safety options to consider when installing or
improving a facility. The enhancements listed are intended
to identify the most appropriate for the subject facility.
Effect of Annexation Agreement: Along Spring Mill Road, Ditch
Road, Shelborne Road, Town Road (between 116th and
96th Streets), and 106th Street (between Commerce Drive
and Spring Mill Road), Carmel intends to install side paths
on both sides of Collector Streets. The timing and final
design of side paths will depend on topography, availability
of right-of-way, and environmental constraints. No other
information in the C3 Plan shall be construed as superseding
this section.

Each of the bicycle and pedestrian facility classifications
listed above has a page dedicated to describing how it can be
used to convey bicycle and pedestrian traffic and how it fits
into the fabric of the City. Further, the following headings
are used, as described below, to convey the essence of each
bicycle and pedestrian facility classification:
General Description: This section gives the reader a brief
description of why the bicycle and pedestrian facility
classification has been established.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Features: This section conveys
the primary design standards that make each bicycle and
pedestrian facility classification unique. The standards
include: right-of-way, minimum facility width, construction
material, joints, obstructions, and street separation.

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN PLAN MAP
The Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan Map (on page 75) applies
the bicycle and pedestrian facility classifications throughout
Carmel’s planning jurisdiction. The bicycle and pedestrian
facility classifications represent the future system, not what
exists today.
The Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan Map is used to denote
where new bicycle and pedestrian facilities are necessary
to fulfill the C3 Plan’s goals to mitigate traffic and promote
ease of travel by all modes. These bicycle and pedestrian
facilities should be viewed as mandatory when land is being
developed adjacent to or inclusive of the new facility’s
proposed location.

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
TRANSIT PLAN
The City is actively in pursuit of a means to convey
commuters between key locations in Carmel, Hamilton
County, and Indianapolis. The City also has interest in
an intra-city system to allow people to travel between key
destinations in the City without using their own automobile.
The primary purpose of these interests is to mitigate traffic
on arterial streets and highways. The accomplishment of
a regional commuter line and intra-city system would also
help nurture the integrity of the natural environment by
reducing emissions and consumption of petroleum products.
It is suggested that a commuter line can not only mitigate
traffic congestion, but can reduce commute times to
downtown. Collectively, these benefits are expected to make
a commuter line an attractive option for those who work in
downtown Indianapolis but live in Carmel or vice versa.

Transit Facility Classifications and Descriptions

The following transit classifications are used on the Transit
Plan Map:
1. Commuter Line................................................. pg 78
2. Intra-city Transportation.................................... pg 79

Each of the transit facility classifications listed above has a
page dedicated to describing how it can be used to mitigate
traffic and how it fits into the fabric of the City. Further, the
following headings are used, as described below, to convey
the essence of each transit facility classification:
General Description: This section gives the reader a brief
description of why the transit classification has been
established.
Design Priorities: This section conveys the primary design
standards that should apply to each type of transit to make it
successful.

A secondary purpose for a commuter line and intra-city
system is to provide accessibility to disabled persons, youth,
seniors, and others who cannot, or do not wish to, drive.
Many factors contribute to the viability of any transit system.
For instance, the cost of gasoline influences potential
ridership, thus the revenue stream. Other factors include:
• gross residential population of the communities being
served,
• density of population near transit station,
• number of workers and residents within a 5 minute walk
of a transit station,
• design of the system (e.g. raised or at-grade),
• cost per ride,
• percent of system being subsidized by the government,
• convenience of system (e.g. transit stations near desired
destination),
• frequency of transit vehicles (i.e. wait time for boarding),
• actual and perceived degree of safety and security,
• time riding transit verses driving car, and
• availability of parking areas.
This section of the C3 Plan is intended to explore transit
opportunities to meet the needs of a developing and
redeveloping community. It is not intended to encourage
high density for the sake of establishing a transit system.

CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

77

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
COMMUTER LINE
General Description

A Commuter Line would be designed to carry a large
number of people from key locations in Carmel to one or
more destinations in downtown Indianapolis. Additional
stops en route to downtown Indianapolis may also be
necessary.
The interim express bus system should continue to be
supported and enhanced to mitigate traffic and provide
familiarity with commuter systems.
Currently the type of commuter line (e.g. raised monorail
or light rail) has not been conceptualized, nor has any
engineering or comprehensive study been completed to
choose a route into Carmel. Extensive study should be
conducted to determine an exact route, station locations,
scheduling, ridership, cost, phasing, ties to other alternative
transportation, and type of “vehicle” to use. For that
reason this section is primarily a placeholder for revisions
and additions as further study is conducted. Everything
contained in this section should be considered conceptual
and preliminary.

MetroLink in St. Louis is an example of light rail. The electric
powered system uses overhead power lines for energy.

Design Priorities

• Commuter stops should take the form of stations with
shelters, waiting areas, and bicycle parking.
• Stations in Carmel should be located in areas with
intense employment and large parking capacity, or dense
populations living within walking distance.
• Destinations for commuters to include Keystone at the
Crossing and downtown Indianapolis.
• “Express” commute time to downtown Indianapolis.
• “Vehicles” should provide the space for passengers to
transport their bicycles.

The Clarian People Mover was installed in Indianapolis to better
link hospital campuses to one another. This system represents an
automated and raised rail system.

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Office uses the above
image to describe an at-grade automated rail system. The location
of the system is unknown.

78

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
INTRA-CITY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
General Description

A Intra-city Transportation System would be designed to
carry a moderate number of people between key locations
in Carmel. Additional routes may include key locations
in Zionsville, Noblesville, Indianapolis, Westfield, and/or
Fishers. Most likely, this system would be a driver-operated,
on-street system.
Currently the type of Intra-city Transportation System
(e.g. trolly or bus) has not been conceptualized, nor has
any comprehensive study been conducted to determine
an on-street system of routes and stops. Extensive study
should be conducted to determine potential routes, stops,
scheduling, ridership, cost, phasing, ties to other alternative
transportation, and type of vehicles. For that reason this
section is primarily a placeholder for revisions and additions
as further study is conducted. Everything contained in this
section should be considered conceptual and preliminary.

The New Flyer brand hybrid electric bus represents the latest
technology in low floor (for easy in and out) and low emission
transit vehicles. Buses like this could match Carmel’s commitment
to a fleet of fuel efficient and low emissions vehicles.

Design Priorities

• Intra-city stops should take the form of “turnouts” to
provide safe ingress and egress from the vehicle.
• Turnouts in Carmel should be located at popular
destinations like Old Town, City Center, Clay Terrace,
U.S. 31 office parks, Merchants’ Square, Central Park,
and strategic locations near higher density residential
developments.
• Convenience of schedule and efficiency in time.
• User-friendly and predictable.
• Driver operated.

Some communities desire themed buses so riders can quickly
recognize them and to fit better into the context. This trolly bus is
used in Central Park in New York City.

Compact buses, like this one used in Long Beach, California,
provide lower up-front cost and are more maneuverable in urban
environments.

CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
TRANSIT FACILITY PLAN
A Transit Facility Plan should be prepared to identify
potential routes using key corridors. The Transit Facility
plan would also identify high density or intense nodes that
would benefit from a transit stop. Once prepared the Transit
Facility Plan can help promote proper development where
transit stops will most likely be located, and to discourage
incompatible land uses from locating adjacent to routes or
near transit stops.
The Transit Facility Plan Map, when prepared, should be
located on the following page.

INTRODUCTION
Any street or highway system must address the functions of both land access and traffic movement,
which are necessary but conflicting functions. Excessive roadside developments and uncontrolled
driveway connections preclude the orderly and safe movement of traffic and result in poor levels of
service, increased hazards, and early obsolescence of the roadway. This leaves the authorities
responsible for the street or highway with the challenge of providing adequate access to properties
while not sacrificing traffic operations along the route.
The rights of property owners for access are recognized. It is also understood that residential,
commercial and industrial growth within an expanding metropolitan area is desirable and will occur.
As travel demand and land development increases in the developing urban fringes, roadways
deteriorate in their ability to accommodate traffic safely and efficiently.
It can easily be shown that traffic congestion and unlimited access adversely affects conditions for
transacting business, produces accidents, negatively impacts air quality, interferes with the operation
of fire and police forces and, in general, reduces the enjoyment of many phases of urban life and
activity.
The streets and highways constitute an important resource and a major public investment. It is
essential to operate them efficiently. Access management calls for a significant improvement in
access design and spacing standards in recognition that the lack of access control is the largest single
cumulative design element reducing roadway safety and capacity. A well conceived, comprehensive
access management program can save time and lives while maximizing the capacity of the roadway
and preserving access to surrounding activities.
An Access management program thus should extend planning and engineering principles to the
location, design and operation of driveways serving development along the roadway system. Access
management is an effective application and a vital component of congestion management systems.
Comprehensive access management programs allow traffic engineers, planners and developers to
work together in developing a workable roadway system for all involved.
The primary objective of this manual is to establish guidelines for the location and design of
driveways providing access from public streets and highways to developments on abutting
properties. In order for the guidelines to be of maximum value, it is necessary that wide flexibility be
retained in their application. Engineering judgment should override recommended dimensions if
warranted by specific traffic conditions.

i

I.

ACCESS MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS:
If the objectives mentioned in the Introduction are to be achieved effectively, the Access
Management Program and Access Standards Manual must include the following elements:
A.

Technical:
Guidelines should be followed which manage access through design and operation;
use of islands, turning lanes, radii and driveway requirements. The guidelines should
establish ways to coordinate internal and external access plans.

B.

Legislative:
Laws relative to access control, permits, site plan guidelines, financial requirements
and zoning requirements

C.

Enforcement:
Procedures for monitoring adherence to regulations

D.

Coordination among agencies:
Coordination between city, county, state, transportation and land use planners, traffic
engineers and law enforcement agencies in the community must be maintained by
the respective agencies.

Access management views the roadway and its surrounding activities as part of a single
system. The goal is to coordinate the planning and design of each element to preserve the
capacity of the overall road system and to allow efficient access to and from the activities
along it.
The effects of any proposed access must be evaluated not only for the proposed
development, but also for its impact on other development in the vicinity and the cumulative
effect in the area.
To ensure safety standards and reduce congestion, a full access that will serve a
development (commercial, industrial, and residential developments), that is either
directly off of a major roadway or off of a roadway that intersects with a major roadway
or the ramps of that roadway, is recommended to be located no less than 1,000 feet from
the nearest intersection. Accesses limited to right turns into and out of the development
may be permitted within the 1,000 feet when deemed appropriate by the Responsible
Authority. The distance of 1,000 feet allows for adequate turning storage and
deceleration tapers for both the roadway and development (a typical 45 mph speed limit
would require 960 feet of taper and storage). The corridors that have been designated as
major roadways in which the above applies are listed and provided in map form in
Appendix A. However, when deemed appropriate by the Responsible Authority, the
above may be recommended on a corridor not listed or shown in Appendix A.

1

II.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS/ANALYSIS STEPS
The following types of information are necessary to reach appropriate traffic decisions
regarding access for development:
A.

Characteristics of the existing roadways and public transportation system; parking
practices, roadway widths, daily and peak hour traffic volumes (preferably
directional) established right-of-way widths, travel times and delays, signal locations,
bus service routes and frequencies.

B.

Characteristics of proposed developments; type, size, parking space provisions and
location with respect to nearby access points.

C.

Future development traffic; parking space requirements, peak traffic hours, peakhours of specific development, and number of vehicles entering and leaving the site
and their directional flow.

D.

Evaluation of composite traffic on surrounding and approach roads; the addition of
development traffic to highway traffic for the opening year of the development. The
estimates should be realistic so that understating or overstating of demand is avoided.

E.

Road system adequacy and needs; the ability of the roadway system to carry the
anticipated traffic should be analyzed and improvements outlined. Future volumes
should be compared with present and future capacities.

F.

Access Plan: Identify the needed access changes along the adjoining roads,
coordinated with the driveways leading to and from the site and the internal site plan
for the development.

G.

Financial responsibilities: Developers, communities, and the Responsible Authority
must arrange and agree upon the timing and cost of proposed improvements.

H.

Major options and issues involved with analysis of specific access locations are as
follows:
1.

Can full access be provided between the roadway and the development?

2.

Should access be restricted to right turns into and out of the given
development?

3.

Should access points be relocated so that they line up with existing access to
the development on opposite sides of the street or relocated away from
intersections?

2

4.

Should access points be spread to separate conflicting left turns into and out
of the site, and what criteria should be considered in such circumstances?

5.

Should access points be prohibited along major streets and allowed only
along secondary streets?

6.

If there is a access road plan in effect for the corridor, how does access for
this development relate to the permanent access road entrance locations?

The objective is to assure that development can be effectively managed from a
transportation perspective. Techniques include better control of conflict points,
separation of turning and through traffic, and coordination of access locations with
both the roadway system and internal circulation system.

ADDITIONAL APPLICATION INFORMATION
A.

No person, firm, corporation, or developer shall add, construct or reconstruct any
entrance, driveway, or approach connecting with any public roadway, nor shall any
curb along such roadway be cut, or removed without the written permit of the
Responsible Authority, and only according to established requirements, including
those of the Access Standards Manual and the Americans With Disabilities Act
(ADA).

B.

The Responsible Authority shall determine and establish such requirements and
restrictions for private entrances, driveways and approaches as considered necessary
to provide for drainage, adequate safety features, preservation of the roadway, and
efficient movement of people and goods.

C.

All work shall be inspected and approved by the Responsible Authority. The entire
cost of construction shall be borne by the person, firm, corporation, or developer to
whom the permit is issued.

D.

The Responsible Authority is authorized to require, before granting the permit, that
sufficient bond be given or cash deposit made with the Responsible Authority to
ensure the carrying out of the terms of such permit. The bond or deposit shall be
returned when the requirements of the permit have been met.

E.

The owners or occupants of the properties adjacent to the roadway shall maintain and
keep in repair all such private entrances, driveways and approaches once constructed.

F.

When any roadway is constructed or reconstructed, the construction of all public
road approaches and existing private approaches, together with the drainage
structures required for its protection, can be included as part of the improvement of
the roadway.

5

When the roadway is constructed or reconstructed, the Responsible Authority may
require the relocation of any existing drives in the interest of safety to the motoring
public. The person, firm, corporation or developer owning or occupying the
properties adjacent to the roadway shall make such change in location under the
direction of the Responsible Authority. Upon completion of the roadway, the owners
or occupants of properties adjacent to the roadway shall keep in repair all private
approaches or driveways from such roadways.
G.

When there is a change in the type of business and/or land use of an existing
property, regardless of how minor, a new application for a land use permit or
certificate of occupancy must be submitted to the plan commission office of the
responsible jurisdiction. At that time, existing access to the site may be reviewed and
changes may be required depending on the impact of the change in land use.

H.

The person, firm, corporation, or developer must obtain a driveway permit
concurrently with the Improvement Location Permit and/or Building Permit.

I.

Any person, firm, corporation, or developer violating any of the provisions of this
section shall be subject to a fine not to exceed the amount as set forth as a fine for
such offense by the Responsible Authority (if fine provisions exist within the
particular jurisdiction).

J.

The expense of relocation or replacement of any or all improvements within the
right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the permittee.

K.

In no case shall vehicles be allowed to stand on any portion of the roadway. It will be
the owner's responsibility to close the entrance of the facility before stacking on the
roadway occurs due to lack of onsite parking or circulation.

L.

Construction of entrance and approach shall be completed within one year of
issuance of such permit. If such construction is not completed, the permit must be
renewed.

M.

The angle of any drive or approach shall be 90 degrees unless otherwise approved by
the Responsible Authority.

N.

When access is requested to a loading dock, there must be sufficient distance
between the dock and the sidewalk or right of-way to prevent encroachment while
parking or maneuvering. Permits for loading dock facilities should be reviewed by
respective land use staff of the Responsible Authority to ensure proper on and offsite circulation in accordance with ordinance requirements as well as those of the
transportation facilities involved.

6

V.

O.

Liability insurance must be furnished according to the Responsible Authority's
requirements.

P.

The Responsible Authority reserves the right to remove or barricade nonconforming
access installations.

TEMPORARY PERMITS:
The issuance of a Temporary Permit for the construction of access driveways will be
considered under the following circumstances:
1)

Temporary access is needed for construction vehicles during the site
development or building construction phase of a project;

2)

Temporary access is needed prior to the development and installation of an
access road on adjacent properties. For example, where access roads are
required or the roadway has been designated a "Limited Access Controlled
Highway" and the permanent access location is not established along the
frontage of the property seeking access;

3)

Access is desired along a roadway scheduled for improvement by the
Responsible Authority.

In all cases, a temporary permit should be prominently labeled "Temporary Access Permit"
and should clearly designate an expiration time frame tied to a specific date or event.
Renewal requests must be in writing and submitted to the Responsible Authority 60 days
prior to the permit expiration. A written response will be returned to the permit applicant,
detailing the rationale for the approval or denial of the permit extension, with a copy of the
letter filed with the original permit.
Prior to a temporary permit expiring, the permitted access must be removed and the right of
way restored to a condition similar to the adjacent right of way, allowing for the continuation
of any roadway pavement, pavement markings, berms, drainage swales, piping, grass areas,
etc.

7

The granting of temporary permits for access to designated "Limited Access Control
Highways" or to normal roadways scheduled for improvement will be considered where
such permits will be accepted by the owner or the developer with the inclusion of a suitable
clause protecting the Responsible Authority against improvement costs. The permit should
contain a paragraph worded essentially as follows:
"The applicant hereby states that he/she is the owner of record of the tract of land to be
served by the access driveway described herein, said land being situated in the County of
____________, State of Indiana, and described as follows: _______(Legal description and
common address)__________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________.
The applicant understands that the above described driveway is within the limits of a
designated protected corridor, an access road plan area, or limits of existing or proposed
public right-of-way and that such entrance will be removed or revised at such time that the
Responsible Authority completes negotiations for access rights to the property or right-ofway. It is further understood that this permit is accepted with the full understanding that any
improvement or construction on the property after __________________ shall not be
considered as increasing the value of the rights of access or right-of-way at such time as
these rights are obtained for the purpose of developing the adjacent facility."
Since temporary permits of this sort will have a direct bearing on the acquisition of access
rights and right-of-way in the future and in case the property under permit changes
ownership, the Responsible Authority retains the right to require that the permit be duly
recorded with the proper Agency.
The same standards and criteria shall govern temporary driveway permits as previously
outlined for all driveways to roadway facilities.

11

2.

Special Requirements:
a)

Two entrances
Two entrances may be permitted when circumstances warrant, based
on anticipated traffic generation, road classification, average daily
traffic volumes, speed limits, total feet of frontage controlled, and
other engineering considerations. Two entrances will be permitted
only when necessary to provide safe and efficient traffic flow and if
the property does not lie within a designated protected corridor. Final
determination will be at the sole discretion of the Responsible
Authority.

b)

Divided entrance
A divided (boulevard) entrance may be required for major traffic
generators. The Responsible Authority reserves the right to permit or
require a divided entrance, based on the traffic generation of the
proposed use and the effect on the traffic carrying capacity of the
adjacent highway. The entrance and exit drives shall be operated in a
one-way pattern. The length of the median, and/or barrier curb along
the right edge of the entrance should be extended a sufficient length
internally to preclude conflicts within the development site which
could cause traffic stacking on the roadway.

c)

Entrances for use primarily by tractor-trailer combinations
Entrances for use primarily by tractor-trailer combinations may be
permitted by the Responsible Authority. AASHTO WB 50 wheel
path templates shall be used for geometric design.

12

d)

Traffic control devices
Traffic control devices shall be placed or installed when warranted.
All devices shall be installed in accordance with current standards
found in the state or federal MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices).
1.

Signage & Pavement markings
All signs and pavement markings will be in accordance with
the most recent version of the MUTCD as required by the
Responsible Authority.

2.

Traffic Signals
Signals installed at entrances to development will be installed
and interconnected as desired by the Responsible Authority.
Power shall be furnished in compliance with the "Industrial
and Commercial Signal Policy" (Page 37) and in accordance
with the terms of the permit. Subsequent to installation, the
traffic control signals will become the property of the
Responsible Authority.

e)

Multiple Land Use Complex
A multiple land use complex will be considered as one site and
integral buildings to be constructed shall not receive separate
consideration for an entrance.

f)

Access Roads
Access roads may be required in designated corridors by the
Responsible Authority. The Responsible Authority shall determine
the width of easements (right-of-way) needed and establish the
permanent access locations. Permittee shall submit a signed and
recorded access road agreement and documentation of temporary
access closures. See Drawing #9 of Appendix B (Page 50).

13

g)

Standing Vehicles
In no case shall vehicles be allowed to stand on any portion of the
roadway (public or private). It will be the owner's responsibility to
provide sufficient on-site parking and vehicle circulation or close the
entrance of the facility before such a condition occurs.

h)

Auxiliary lanes
Auxiliary lanes may be required for any or all of the following
reasons:
1.
2.
3.
4.

the Responsible Authority determines overall roadway efficiency
would be improved. Minimum spacing would be determined by the
Responsible Authority.

14

C.

GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA:
1.

Corridor / Intersection Protection Guidelines
To ensure safety standards and reduce congestion, a full access that will
serve a development (commercial, industrial, and residential
developments), that is either directly off of a major roadway or off of a
roadway that intersects with a major roadway or the ramps of that
roadway, is recommended to be located no less than 1,000 feet from the
nearest intersection. Accesses limited to right turns into and out of the
development may be permitted within the 1,000 feet when deemed
appropriate by the Responsible Authority. The distance of 1,000 feet
allows for adequate turning storage and deceleration tapers for both the
roadway and development (a typical 45 mph speed limit would require
960 feet of taper and storage). The corridors that have been designated as
major roadways in which the above applies are listed and provided in map
form in Appendix A. However, when deemed appropriate by the
Responsible Authority, the above may be recommended on a corridor not
listed or shown in Appendix A.

2.

Driveway Spacing Requirements
No direct access drive to an arterial should be located within the operational
area of an intersection. Table 1 presents the access-drive spacing that is
required.

Property Line Clearance Requirements
A minimum property clearance should also be considered so that vehicles
can exit one driveway and safely enter the adjacent driveway. For this
maneuver, a minimum property clearance distance of 15 ft. should be
provided. The recommended property clearance shown in Table 2 and Table
3 should serve as a guideline if minimum driveway separation distances
cannot be implemented directly.

Corner Clearance Requirements
Corner Clearance on Intersecting Streets. Small corner clearance will result
in a high probability that an access drive to a minor street will be blocked by
vehicles stopped at the intersection. Blockage of the of an ingress maneuver
presents a serious operational problem. When there are numerous turns from
the major street to the minor street, traffic backup may extend into the
intersection and seriously interfere with traffic movement on the major street.
Suggested minimum dimensions for design are given in Figure 1 for
signalized intersection control and Figure 2 for stop-sign intersection control.

6.1

General Criteria for Auxiliary Lanes
a.

Graph 1 and Graph 2 are based upon trucks exceeding 30,000 pounds
gross vehicle weight (G.V.W.) being less than seven percent of the
DHV. If the access will have a larger percentage of vehicles
exceeding 30,000 G.V.W., the access DHV values in the graphs may
be reduced by one-half to require median speed change lanes in the
interest of public safety.

b.

Where higher left turning volumes, safety, or traffic operations
necessitates, a double left turn design may be required.

c.

If the design of the access is within two different speed zones, the
criteria for the higher speed zone will apply.

d.

When the public safety so requires due to site specific conditions,
such as sight distance, a turn lane may be required even though
the criteria in this subsection are not met.

e.

When calculating the highway single lane DHV, it will be assumed
that all lanes have equal volumes.

Deceleration lanes for Right Turning Vehicles
a.

An auxiliary lane for right turning deceleration movements is
required for any access according to Graph 1 when the DHV values
of the highway single lane and the DHV of right turns intersect at a
point on or above the curve for the posted speed.

b.

Where the DHV of the right turn into the access is less than five
DHV and the outside lane volume exceeds 250 DHV on a 45 to 55
MPH highway, then a right turn lane may be required due to high
traffic volumes or other unique site specific safety considerations.

c.

When the access volume meets or exceeds 25 DHV with a highway
posted speed of 25 to 40 MPH, a right turn deceleration lane is
required.

6.2

Deceleration Lanes for Left Turning Vehicles
a.

A speed change lane for left turning movements is required for any
access according to Graph 2 when the DHV values of the highway
single lane and the DHV of left turns intersect at a point on or above
the curve for the posted speed.

b.

Where the DHV of the left turn into the access is less than 12 DHV
and the inside lane volume exceeds 250 DHV on 45 to 55 MPH
highways or 400 DHV on 25 to 40 MPH highways, a left turn lane
may be required due to the high traffic volumes or other unique site
specific safety considerations.

c.

When the access volume meets or exceeds 30 DHV on 25 to 40 MPH
highways, or 25 DHV on 45 to 55 MPH highways, a left turn
deceleration lane is required.

Construction of Auxiliary Lanes (speed change lanes)
(1)

When auxiliary lanes are required, they shall be constructed in
accordance with this subsection and the requirements of the
Responsible Authority.

(2)

Where two accesses have auxiliary lanes that overlap, or are in close
proximity but do not overlap, a continuous lane shall be established
between the accesses to improve roadway consistency, safety, and to
maintain edge continuity.

(3)

Auxiliary lane widths shall meet design standards established for
RRR projects. (see Appendix C for reference)

(4)

Where no curb and gutter is required, a paved shoulder shall be
provided that matches the existing shoulder width along the highway
or is a minimum of four feet in width, whichever is greater.

The auxiliary lane elements are illustrated in Figure 3.

6.5

Median Design
a.

A median area is necessary in order to construct a left-turn
deceleration lane as required according to subsection 5.

b.

When it is necessary to widen a highway for a median and public
right-of-way is made available, the highway should be widened
equally on both sides in order to maintain the existing highway
centerline alignment.

Storage Length
a.

Additional storage length is required to accommodate turning
vehicles according to the following table where vehicle turning
movements for a left turn deceleration lane are 30 DHV or greater. A
right turn deceleration lane shall provide for vehicle storage length
when there is a controlled stop condition. Storage for right turns may
be one-half the length required by Table 7.

average truck plus 10 feet shall be added to the storage length
required by this table.

26

6.6

Grade Adjustment
Auxiliary lanes including tapers required adjustments in length according to
the following conditions. Auxiliary lanes shall use the following
multiplication factors in determining auxiliary lane length for all highways
with grades of 3 percent or greater. Grade is the ratio of the change in
elevation to the length of slope. Multiply the lengths required in subsections
5.1 by the appropriate factors given in Tables 8 and 9.

Sight Distance Requirements
a.

Permits shall not be issued that include design elements or allow any
turning movements where the sight distance is inadequate to allow
the safe movement of any motorist using or passing the access.

b.

Table 10 shall be used to determine the required horizontal and
vertical sight distance necessary as measured from the vehicle
traveling on the highway to the access.

c.

1.

This table is based on wet pavement conditions and the
average vehicle maintaining the posted speed limit. These
lengths shall be adjusted for any grade of three percent or
greater using the tables in subsection 5.6.

2.

For calculating this sight distance, a height of 3.5 feet shall be
used for the driver's eyes and a height of 4.25 feet shall be
used for a vehicle assumed to be on the centerline of the
access five feet back from the edge of the traveled way. The
driver's eye shall be assumed to be at the centerline of the
inside lane (inside with respect to the curve) for measurement
purposes.

In addition to the sight distance necessary for vehicles traveling on
the highway to see vehicles or objects in the traveled way, it is also
necessary to provide the entering vehicle adequate sight distance in
order to enter or cross the highway. Table 11 shall be used to
establish the minimum sight distance necessary for the entering
vehicle.
1.

The vehicle shall be the largest vehicle normally intended to
use the access in excess of an average of one per day.

2.

Sight distance shall be measured at a height of 3.5 feet from
the entering driver to a height of 4.25 feet for the oncoming
vehicle.

28

3.

The entering driver's eyes shall be assumed to be 10 feet back
from the edge of the traveled way.

4.

If there is no median or if the median is too narrow to safely
store a left turning or crossing vehicle (a 20 foot minimum for
passenger cars), both directions shall be considered from the
access location.

5.

If the median can safely store the turning or crossing vehicle,
then sight distance shall consider a two stop condition. The
vehicle will stop once at the outside edge of the outside lane
and again within the median. Each one-way highway
direction shall be considered separately.

After sight distance requirements are met and an access permit
issued, a sign structure or parked vehicle shall not be permitted where
it will obstruct the required sight distance.

Other Design Elements
a.

For all curb cuts, the vertical curve from the traveled way into the
access shall be the flattest curve that can be obtained. To prevent
center or overhang drag, with some allowance for load and bounce,
crest vertical curves should not exceed a four inch hump in a 10-foot
chord. For any access that is not a curb cut, including streets and
private access using curb returns, the first 20 feet beyond the closest
highway lane, including speed change lanes or the distance to the side
drain, whichever is greater, shall slope down and away from the
highway at a two percent grade to ensure proper drainage control.

29

b.

Within the right-of-way, maximum grades shall be limited to 8.33
percent for all access drives. Lesser grades may be required for
drainage control purposes.

c.

The horizontal axis of an access to the highway shall be at a right
angle to the centerline of the highway and extend a minimum of 40
feet beyond the traveled way. An angle between 90 and 60 degrees
may be acceptable only if significant physical constraints require a
skew angle less than 90 degrees and is approved based upon site
specific conditions.

d.

Access specifications shall ensure that the access is designed and
constructed in a manner that will encourage proper use by the
motorist. Access for one-way operation shall be approved only
when design conditions ensure one-way operation.

e.

An access that has a gate across it shall be designed so that the
longest vehicle using it can completely clear the traveled way when
the gate is closed.

f.

The access shall be designed to facilitate the movement of vehicles
off the highway to prevent the queuing of vehicles on the traveled
way. An access shall not be approved for parking areas that require
backing maneuvers within the rights-of-way of the responsible
jurisdiction. All off-street parking areas must include on-site
maneuvering areas and aisles to permit user vehicles to enter and exit
the site in forward drive without hesitation.

g.

Fill slopes and cut slopes shall be constructed either to current
standards of Responsible Authority, (AASHTO) or to the slope of
the existing highway near the access, whichever is safer. It is
desirable that all side slopes have a slope of 6:1 for 12 feet. A
minimum of 4:1 for six feet, than not steeper than 3:1 unless
physically restricted. Tighter slopes may be permitted when
necessary.

h.

Access design shall provide for the safe movement of all highway
right-of-way users, including but not limited to pedestrians,
bicyclists, and the disabled. Sidewalks may be required where
appropriate or when requested by the Responsible Authority.
Bikepaths may be included in the access permit upon request by the
local authority.

30

i.

In the event it becomes necessary to remove any right-of-way fence,
the posts on either side of the entrance shall be securely braced with
an approved end post before the fence is cut to prevent any slacking
of the remaining fence. All posts and wire removed are property of
the Responsible Authority.

j.

Where necessary to remove, relocate, or repair a traffic control device
or public or private utilities for the construction of a permitted access,
the cost shall be borne by the permittee.

k.

Further details of access construction and design, including pavement
thickness and specifications, curb design and specifications, roadway
fill design and compaction, and other specific details, shall be
provided by the Responsible Authority.

l.

Installation of any traffic control device shall conform to the Indiana
M.U.T.C.D. Where the access may warrant signalization in the
future, phasing of the installation may be required.

m.

An access that crosses or otherwise affects pedestrian, bicycle, or
handicapped facilities, shall have the necessary modifications to
ensure the safe crossing of the access and the safe use of the facility
by pedestrians, bicyclists and the disabled.

n.

Each access should be separated by a distance equal to the stopping
sight distance values given in Table 11.

o.

When an access permit requires the widening or reconstruction of the
roadway, the design shall meet the current standards of the
Responsible Authority.

p.

Physical separation and delineation along a property frontage such as
curb and gutter or fencing, may be required where necessary to
ensure that access will be limited to permitted locations.

31

q.

A Clear Zone shall meet 3R Standards. (A relatively clear and flat
area beyond the edge of the roadway is important for the recovery of
errant vehicles. Roadway hazards in the clear zone such as fixed
objects or steep embankments may need to be removed,
reconstructed or shielded by a proper barrier. In urban areas with
speeds of 40 MPH or less and vertical curbs, a clear zone of at least
1.5 feet minimum should be provided. Where there is no curb in
urban and rural areas and the speed is 40 MPH or less, a 10-foot clear
zone should be provided. At speeds of 45 MPH or greater, a 20 to 30
foot clear zone is recommended. Within the road right-of-way, every
attempt will be made to adhere to the clear zone requirements.)

r.

For establishments, or development with high turnover rates and
limited parking area (drive-in restaurants, drug stores, grocery stores)
the parking spaces shall be laid out in such a manner as to preclude
entering vehicles from interfering with traffic on the roadway.

s.

The capacity and storage requirements of an above referenced
intersection shall be checked by the Responsible Authority based on
a projection of the existing traffic according to the current
transportation plan, and if the indicated minimum dimensions are
below storage requirements, they shall be increased accordingly.

t.

The permittee shall be responsible for any curbing, pavement
widening, deceleration lanes, recovery lanes, islands, access roads, or
drainage structures required. All construction shall be of a structural
design and type acceptable to the agency responsible for the adjacent
public roadway.

u.

No part of the driveway entrance (excluding the acceleration and
deceleration lanes and flare) may extend beyond a line extended
perpendicularly from the roadway centerline to the point of
intersection of the property line and the right-of-way without the
written permission of the adjacent property owner.

v.

When the parking or driving area of a property is adjacent to a
sidewalk or an alley, then a suitable non-mountable barrier must be
constructed to prevent encroachment.

32

9.

Storage Requirements
In no case shall vehicles be allowed to stand on any portion of the roadway
(public or private). It will be the owner's responsibility to provide sufficient
on-site parking and vehicle circulation or close the entrance of the facility
before such a condition occurs.
a.

Car Washes
1.

A car wash shall be designed to permit storage of vehicles
within the facility equal to 100% of the anticipated peak hour
capacity. In units having more than 1 bay, Table 12 shall be
used.

2.

The exit distance for each bay shall be a minimum of 50 feet
from the right-of-way line.

11.

Drainage
a.

Each access shall be constructed in a manner that shall not cause
water to enter onto the roadway, and shall not interfere with the
drainage system on the right-of-way.

b.

The permittee shall provide, at his or her own expense, drainage
structures for the access which will become an integral part of the
existing drainage system. The type, design and condition of these
structures must meet the approval of the Responsible Authority.

c.

Drainage structures shall not restrict the existing drainage system nor
any adopted municipal drainage plan.

d.

The highway drainage system is for the protection of the highway
right-of-way. It is not designed or intended to serve the drainage
requirements of abutting properties beyond that which has
historically flowed to the right-of-way. Drainage to the right-of-way
shall not exceed the undeveloped historical flow. The use of
controlled flow detention ponds shall be considered to control this
flow from developed properties. When curb and gutter is required,
the drainage ditch should be eliminated by installing a storm sewer
system. The Responsible Authority shall determine the appropriate
drainage controls necessary to meet existing or projected site specific
conditions.

Maintenance
The permittee, his or her heirs, successors-in-interest, and assigns, of the
property serviced by the access shall be responsible for meeting the terms
and conditions of the permit and the removal or clearance of snow or ice
upon the access even though deposited on the access in the course of snow
removal operations by the Responsible Authority. The Responsible Authority
shall maintain in unincorporated areas the roadway drainage system,
including those culverts under the access which are part of that system within
the right-of-way.

12.

Driveway Abandonment
At any time an existing driveway is abandoned or use of such driveway is
discontinued, it shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property
formerly accessed by such driveway to restore the public right-of-way to its
original condition. Determination of original condition shall be made by the
Responsible Authority.

35

DEFINITION OF TERMS
In the interpretation of these requirements, the word "shall" is to be interpreted as being
mandatory. The word "should", "desirable", or other words of similar import are to be
interpreted as being the recommendations of the Responsible Authority as denoting a factor
to be considered in determining whether a permit can be issued.
ABUTTING PROPERTY A lot or parcel of land which shares all or part of a common lot
line with another lot or parcel of land.
ACCELERATION LANE A speed-change lane, including tapered areas, for the purpose of
enabling a vehicle entering a roadway to increase its speed to a rate at which it can more
safely merge with through traffic.
ACCESS Any driveway or other point of ingress/egress such as a street, road or highway
that connects to the general street system. Where two public roadways intersect, the
secondary roadway shall be considered the access.
ACCESS CONTROL (LIMITED) Those roadway facilities to which the rights to access
light, air or view in connection with a highway, street, or roadway is fully or partially
controlled by the Responsible Authority.
ACCESS CONTROL (FULL) Access is controlled to such a degree that no access will be
permitted directly to the roadway from abutting property. The physical means of access shall
be limited to interchange ramps, approaches, or other facilities located on public right-ofway, at points designated by the Responsible Authority for specific entrance to or exit from
the roadway facility by the general public.
ACCESS CONTROL (PARTIAL) Access is controlled to such a degree that public access
will be restricted to interchange ramps, at-grade intersection approaches, or other facilities
located on public right-of-way. Private driveways may be permitted at locations designated
by the Responsible Authority solely for residential or agricultural purposes, when so agreed,
or stipulated with the property owner when access rights are required. Any permit for such
an entrance will show the limiting use. No direct access for commercial or industrial use will
be allowed. All other access for abutting property will be as indicated for Full Access
Control facilities. Median opening for U-turns for public use may be provided in accordance
with established criteria.
ACCESS CONTROL (MINIMAL) The rights of abutting property owners of access to the
public roadway are recognized. On these facilities, entrances to the roadway will be allowed
for abutting property, providing such access points comply with the standards and
regulations established by the Responsible Authority.

51

ACCESS ROAD (formerly called frontage road) Separate roadway, auxiliary to and
normally located parallel (at an established setback) to a controlled access facility or
protected corridor. Its purpose is the maintenance of local road continuity and provision of
access to parcels adjacent to the controlled access facility.
ADT The average two-way weekday traffic volume.
AADT The annual average two-way daily traffic volume. It represents the total annual
traffic for the year, divided by 365.
APPLICANT The owner of property or representative of owner applying for an access
permit.
APPROACH PAVEMENT Portion of roadway adjoining the traveled way, including tapers
for recovery lane, deceleration, speed change, turning movements, or other purposes
supplementary to the through traffic movement. The auxiliary lane may be existing or
proposed to be constructed by the applicant.
APPROPRIATE LOCAL AUTHORITY The board of County Commissioners if the access
is to be located in the unincorporated area of the county and the governing body of the
municipality if the access is to be located with the incorporated municipality. Also referred
to as the "Responsible Authority".
ARTERIAL Signalized streets that serve primarily through traffic and provide access to
abutting properties as a secondary function. An Arterial collects and distributes traffic to and
from minor arterials and collectors.
BIKEWAY A pathway, often paved and separated from streets and sidewalks, designed for
use by bicyclists.
CHANNELIZATION The separation or regulation of conflicting traffic movements into
definite paths of travel by use of pavement markings, raised islands or other suitable means
to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of traffic.
COLLECTOR Surface streets providing land access and traffic circulation service within
residential, commercial, and industrial areas. It conveys traffic from arterial streets to lower
order streets.
COMMERCIAL USE Activity carried out for monetary gain.
CORRIDOR A strip of land between two termini within which traffic, topography,
environment and other characteristics are evaluated for transportation purposes.

52

DECELERATION LANE A speed-change lane, including tapered areas, for the purpose of
enabling a vehicle that is to make an exit turn from a roadway to slow to a safe turning speed
after it has left the mainstream of faster-moving traffic.

LAND CLASSIFICATION PLAN
INTRODUCTION
Part 3: Land Classification Plan describes and establishes
different land classifications to be applied appropriately
across Carmel’s planning jurisdiction, similar to a future
land use plan. The term “land classification” is used instead
of “land use” because each classification integrates both
land use and development form. This hybrid approach for
classifying land will result in a better system for managing
land development.
The following land classifications are used on the Land
Classification Map:
1. Parks and Recreation....................................... pg 29
2. Estate Residential............................................. pg 30
3. Low Intensity Suburban Residential................. pg 31
4. Suburban Residential........................................ pg 32

Land Classification Map

The Land Classification Map is described on page 44,
followed by the map on page 45.

Land Classifications and Descriptions

Each of the land classifications listed above have a page
dedicated to describing how it can be used to manage
growth and development. Further, the following headings
are used to convey the essence of each classification. These
descriptions are intended to be conceptual.
Purpose: This section gives the reader a brief description of
why the land use classification has been established.
Geographic Location: This section conveys where each classification is best utilized within Carmel’s planning jurisdiction. Some descriptions are vague because they can be
widely applied, while others are very specific to geographic
locations.
Land Uses: This section describes the general land uses
that would be permitted in the classification. The zoning
ordinance would indicate specific land uses permitted.
28

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Intensity/Density: This section describes the intended intensity
of commercial uses and density of residential uses that
would be fitting of the classification. The zoning ordinance
may utilize more than one zoning district to regulate each
classification.
Examples: This section strives to convey one or more
developments in Carmel that represent the classification. All
examples may not be exact matches, but represent the most
similar in intensity and density.
Appropriate Adjacent Classifications: This section describes
the land use classifications that are best used adjacent to
the subject classification. Three categories of compatibility
exist. “Best Fit” are classifications that are most suited for
adjacency. “Conditional Fit” indicates land classifications
that are suitable for adjacency if the building orientation,
transitions, and architecture are implemented with sensitivity
to the context. The third category are those land classifications not listed, which represent classifications that are not
typically appropriate adjacent to the subject classification.
Structure Features: This section identifies critical structural
features that help achieve the purpose of the classification.
Most statements are in regard to height, mass, or form of the
structure.
Structure Orientation On Site: This section addresses where
the footprint of the structure is located. Options typically
include centralized (setbacks on all four sides), zero lot-line
(front, rear, and one-side setback), build-to (specific front
setback), or no setbacks (the structure can cover the entire
site).
Development Features: This section denotes requirements of
subdivisions, planned unit developments, or development
plan projects. Typically, whole-development standards are
described.
Regulation Implementation: This section describes how the
City’s development regulations will implement the land use
classification’s intent.

Structure Orientation On Site

The City Hall with its campus-like facility is another example of an
Institutional Node. This form is best suited for the City Center area.

• Context sensitive.

Development Features

• Context sensitive.
• Mixed uses are generally allowed, but should be related
to the primary use. For instance, a church could have a
parsonage, book store, or day-care center integrated into
the campus.
• Internal and external bicycle and pedestrian connectivity.
• Protect pre-development environmental features.
• Buffer adjacent residential development appropriately.

Regulation Implementation

• Utilize hybrid (traditional and form-based) zoning to
regulate this land classification.
Places of worship are no longer used just one-day per week.
Mega-churches are becoming more common and are used for long
durations every day. The Capstone Cafe and Bookstore is a good
example of extra uses incorporated into a church.

CLASSIFICATIONS TABLE

LAND CLASSIFICATION MAP DESCRIPTION
The Land Classification Map on the following page
designates the general distribution of land classifications
that will help manage land use, community form, and
connectivity; and improve quality of life.

The below table provides a quick reference for determining
land classification compatibility. The information in this
table mirrors the content in each of the land classification
descriptions on the previous pages. “B” stands for Best Fit
and “C” stands for Conditional Fit, meaning it is appropriate
when the more intense development is installed with
sensitivity to the adjacent land classification.

Specifically, the map depicts the community’s land
use and development form goals (land classifications)
in a conceptual manner. It should not be construed as
representing the precise location of land classifications, but
used as a foundation for support and influence with land use
and development form decisions and zoning map changes.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
INTRODUCTION
Part 2: Comprehensive Plan Essence establishes the City’s
planning policies and objectives categorized by geographic
area. Although there are many similarities in each district
there are also significant differences. This approach will
clearly communicate and guide the public and its leaders
in future decision making and share with the development
community the City’s policies and objectives. Further, the
public can base their expectations on the content of this Part.
Merriam-Webster defines essence as “the most significant
element, quality, or aspect of a thing or person.” For this
reason, the term “essence” was chosen for Part 2’s title to
convey the content within contained the core policies and
objectives for the City of Carmel.
To address each geographic area, this Part is divided into the
following five sections:
1. City-Wide Policies and Objectives.................... pg 17
2. East Carmel Policies and Objectives................ pg 22
3. North Central Carmel Policies
and Objectives.................................................. pg 23
4. South Central Carmel Policies

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
CITY-WIDE POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Introduction: The expression “Leading Edge City” is applied
to communities that have broad name recognition, notable
culture, a positive image, diversity in housing, broad range
of employment, business vitality, strong architectural presence and character, sense of place, environmental awareness,
effective public transportation, and most importantly a
desirable quality of life.

The tools used to manage community form take shape as
development guidelines, zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, studies, small area plans,
negotiations, commitments, conditions, covenants,
redevelopment initiatives, policies, education and the like.
No single tool can effectively manage community form.

Objective 2.1: Commit to high architectural energy efficient
and environmental design standards for all municipal buildings and facilities. The intent is to set a precedent for quality
and to establish character goals for private sector development to emulate. Developers will take cues from municipal
improvements and be more likely to follow the City’s lead.
This commitment will also further the City’s competitive
advantage in the region, and increase community pride in the
built environment.

Introduction: The purpose of managing form is to achieve a
superior quality built and natural environment in which people
reside, work, and recreate. Managing community form is the
combination of land use planning, transportation planning,
urban design, influencing transitions, and place-making.

Managing community form is a departure from purely
land use based regulations that encourage segregation and
challenge the community’s ability to establish essential
connectivity. This model is more permissive of integrating
complementary uses and requires greater sensitivity to
transitions between differing land classifications.
Objective 1.1: Continue to evaluate the pros and cons of
design-oriented regulations (e.g. Old Meridian District) into
the zoning and subdivision control ordinances based on Part
3: Land Classification Plan.
Objective 1.2: Recognize the uniqueness in each planning
district and establish regulations, subarea plans, and/or pattern books to preserve these unique features.
Objective 1.3: Utilize the intent of the C3 Plan to development proposals to leverage the desired outcomes and control
deviations from the City’s policies and objectives.
Objective 1.4: Be very sensitive to connectivity and transitions
between adjacent areas. Discourage unplanned or harsh
contrasts in height, building orientation, character, land use,
and density. If there exists contrast, utilize multiple design
principles to soften transitions.
Objective 1.5: Local streets should be designed to connect to
existing (when practical) and future neighborhoods so that
existing connected streets do not become overburdened.
Objective 1.6: Allow mixed-use in response to market demand
and consumer preferences, and only in areas suitable for
commercial development.
Objective 1.7: Continue to build the city park and trail system
through targeted acquisition of remaining undeveloped
parcels, particularly in areas identified by the 2015 – 2020
Zone Improvement Plan.

Objective 2.2: Further enhance the amenities, development
opportunities, office-supporting commerce and technology
infrastructure necessary to support current businesses and
to attract additional businesses to Carmel. Concurrently, it
is important to continue investing to enhance community
quality of life to provide a superior place for people in all
socioeconomic classes to live by encouraging high quality
public spaces, interesting parks, plazas, public gardens, treelined streets and boulevards, and trails connecting people
to places. There is significant evidence that high quality of
life is a major attraction for businesses, thus making this a
primary component of this objective.
Objective 2.3: Continue to encourage a variety of housing
options to meet the needs of the market place.
Objective 2.4: Support local intra-city and regional commuter
transit systems as described in Part 4: Transportation Plan.
Objective 2.5: Enhance a bicycle- and pedestrian-connected
community through expanded installation of multi-use paths,
sidewalks, bike lanes, and off-street trails. It is well established that many of the moderate-sized leading edge cities in
our nation are bicycle and pedestrian friendly communities.
Carmel believes that the further establishment of bicycle
and pedestrian facilities will result in increased mobility,
further enhance quality of life, and be greatly appreciated by
citizens.
Objective 2.6: Recognize the existing limitations of east/west
vehicular, bike, and pedestrian access, and strive to enhance
means for efficient cross-community travel.

Objective 1.8: Continue to manage commercial signage to
balance the visibility needs of business with the aesthetic
quality which has made Carmel an attractive place to live.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
Policy 3: Perpetuate Economic Vitality

Introduction: Vitality is defined in many ways, including
job growth, quantity of jobs, quality of jobs, proliferation
of commerce, entrepreneurship, investment in property,
redevelopment, length of commitment, and degree of risk
being taken. Carmel has strong economic vitality today, and
furthering that trend is of great interest and importance. This
section addresses the objectives that Carmel will utilize to
perpetuate economic vitality.
Objective 3.1: The City will strive to further the “Carmel”
brand as a great place to live, work and raise a family. The
City has already established a notable degree of branding;
branding being positive name recognition and impression.
Branding of a community is important when trying to attract
quality employers and businesses. For instance, wellrespected retail businesses want to be located in well-known
communities.
Objective 3.2: Encourage mixed-use developments where
appropriate. Single-use developments tend to lack vitality
during off-peak times. Mixed-use developments such as
Providence at Old Meridian often combine commercial and
residential uses into a single node. This type of development encourages daytime vitality from employment and
commerce activity, and nighttime vitality when people come
home from work. Also, this development pattern better
utilizes land by allowing compact urban form.
Objective 3.3: Encourage owners through zoning amendments
to retrofit existing single-use centers into mixed-use centers.
This encourages both daytime and nighttime vitality and
creates a compact urban form.
Objective 3.4: Utilize technology to efficiently communicate
City projects and initiatives to the public. Expand existing
lines of communication to reach more households and gain
more public input. Modernize the City’s website to accommodate this objective.
Objective 3.5: Clarify and streamline development procedures and processes. Simplify the development process
without lessening standards, expectations, or results. Create
incentives for development that exceeds expectations and
standards.
Objective 3.6: Plan for local and regional transit by encouraging transit opportunities in new developments where it
would benefit the community. The City should commission
a study to determine the best transit corridors for local transit
and how best to interface a regional system. Such a study
should also analyze how the City would form and benefit
from improved transit options.
Objective 3.7: Promote the advancement of technology to
support city-wide commerce, the workplace, and home
enterprise.

18

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Objective 3.8: Continue to improve overall telecommunication
in partnership with local providers to ensure that cable based
and wireless opportunities are maximized. The City should
commission a telecommunications master plan to ensure the
highest quality system network.
Objective 3.9: Promote Carmel City Center and the Regional
Performing Arts Center by marketing them as community
and regional destinations. Continue efforts to ensure that
properly scaled infrastructure is in place for vehicles,
bicycles, and pedestrians to easily access the Carmel City
Center area from all directions, including from U.S. 31 and
Keystone Parkway.
Objective 3.10: Continue to build upon the economic benefits
of the U.S. 31 Corridor by further maximizing its development potential. Encourage new buildings to be constructed
of high quality materials at the maximum building heights
allowed and encourage parking areas to be structured for the
most efficient use of land in the corridor.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
Policy 4: Be a City of Neighborhoods

Introduction: Neighborhoods are an essential component of
community which helps build and/or reinforce the fabric of
a city. Traditionally, neighborhoods were not recognized
by each individual development’s name as they are now.
Rather, neighborhoods were determined by major physical
boundaries; included a mix of housing styles; and were
within walking distance to neighborhood service centers,
schools, and parks which gave neighborhoods identity. This
document encourages planning for neighborhoods, in the
traditional sense, and also protects these neighborhoods.
Objective 4.1: Carmel is desirous of achieving the quality of
life benefits derived from the principles of traditional neighborhood design principals, in all neighborhoods including
those within the context appropriate to and respectful of each
location, whether estate, suburban, or urban.
Objective 4.2: The City believes it necessary to conduct
planning in greater detail in critical subareas and corridors.
For this reason Part 5: Critical Corridors and Subareas
was created to house those planning exercises within the
C3 Plan. These small area plans are important in communities with redevelopment pressures and in rapidly growing
areas. Oftentimes, critical corridor and subarea plans can
better address transitions, connectivity, and development
form. They can also address character goals and emphasize to
developers a more exact idea of what the resident wants, what
the market can yield, and what the City expects.
Objective 4.3: Establish neighborhood identity based on physical boundaries rather than by each development’s name.
Neighborhoods are more than each development project. A
concerted effort should be established to determine neighborhood boundaries throughout the City, and then promote
their identity and boundaries.

Policy 5: Be an Adaptable City

Introduction: Being an adaptable city is critical in the evolution of a community. Too many communities do not adapt
to local, regional, and national influences and suffer from the
lack of flexibility.
Objective 5.1: Carmel will regularly reevaluate the local,
regional, and national influences that affect development
success and vitality. The City will also strive to predict the
next evolutions in development to better recognize whether
they would have a positive or negative effect on the City.
Objective 5.2: Periodically review and revise the Land
Classification Plan Map to adapt to changes in the built
environment, evolutions in community values, changes in
community policies, and to respond to critical corridor and
subarea plans.
Objective 5.3: Continue to recognize, plan, and update critical
corridors and subareas.
Objective 5.4: Enhance the Monon Greenway to support and
further encourage its use as a non-motorized commuter route
by widening and separating bicyclists and pedestrians in the
most heavily used areas. Also, actively plan and implement
a system of feeder/branch trails and paths to allow more
convenient and safe connection to nearby residential and
employment areas.
Objective 5.5: Adapt the Monon Greenway and adjacent
development between City Center and the Arts and Design
District into an urban trail destination with its own character
and sense of place.
Objective 5.6: Target for acquisition undeveloped parcels
adjacent to the Monon Greenway for future park sites.

Objective 4.4: Build upon existing neighborhood facilities and
services, such as parks, schools, fire stations, and churches to
help define and maintain neighborhood identity and vitality.
Objective 4.5: Consider and encourage “third places” (informal meeting places or the social surroundings which are
separate from the two usual environments of home and
workplace) and neighborhood support centers as building
blocks for neighborhoods. Every trip to the store should
not be a mandatory drive in a car. Residents should be able
to access daily goods and services by walking or bicycling,
thereby having the opportunity to conserve energy, improve
health, and protect the environment. The City should
embark on a “corner store” initiative to define the best locations and distribution of neighborhood support centers.
Objective 4.6: Disallow incompatible site and building designs
and excessive quantity of neighborhood support centers.
Assure that neighborhood support centers provide amenities
and land uses that enhance quality of life and convenience,
and respect nearby residences with quality architecture, landscaping, and appropriate transitions. Also assure that they
are not a destabilizing feature by adopting design regulations and through implementation of a “radius policy” that

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Introduction: Community character is the quality(ies) and
feature(s) of a neighborhood, district, or the entire community that distinguish it from other areas. Community
character is desired and often helps build local pride, encourages investment, and improves quality of life.
Objective 6.1: Discourage homogeneous development and corporate brand prototypical architecture. In residential areas,
architectural guidelines should be instituted to discourage
monotonous development. Commercial and residential areas
should be subjected to architectural standards that require
unique and appropriate designs fitting Carmel’s character
goals.
Objective 6.2: Promote a unique community with unique
neighborhoods and subareas. Already the City’s infrastructure and planning investments are bearing fruit in the Old
Town Arts and Design District. The community will identify
appropriate character goals, subareas, and neighborhood
boundaries for the East, North Central, South Central, and
West Carmel Districts.
Objective 6.3: Encourage high quality and well designed
landscaping to help beautify the City and promote healthful
environments.
Objective 6.4: Promote the planting and care of canopy trees
throughout Carmel. Encourage their placement even in
urban streetscapes, parking lots, and other enclosed areas by
promoting proper soil volumes and/or the use of constructed
soil technologies. Canopy trees are desired because they add
a great deal of character and comfort to the built environment. Additionally, they also provide relief from heat, soften
noise and light, help purify the air we breathe, reduce stress,
and increase property values. This is a particularly important objective because so many mature trees are lost through
development.
Objective 6.5: Promote the use of public art in both public
spaces and within private developments. Also, encourage designers to include public art in their buildings and
surroundings.
Objective 6.6: Enable healthy choices through the use of
innovative design and planning. For instance, provide
pedestrian access to parks, recreation, schools, the workplace
and amenity centers so that people do not have to use their
cars. Also, designing structures to capture natural light and
air enhances healthy lifestyles.
Objective 6.7: Encourage electrical utility lines to be buried
throughout the community, especially in urbanizing areas.
Care must be given to the location of underground transformer boxes so pedestrian infrastructure is not precluded by
conflicts with power facilities.
Objective 6.8: Protect the character, safety, and function of the
Monon Greenway.
Objective 6.9: Enhance the aesthetics of employment and
vitality districts by requiring parking lots to be located at
the rear and side of the property, or underground, thereby
encouraging the architecture to be the dominant feature.

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Policy 7: Inspire Environmental Awareness

Introduction: Being environmentally aware includes understanding the benefits of protecting natural areas, emphasizing
use of native plant material into the urban environment,
reducing energy consumption, encouraging energy and
natural resource conservation, and utilizing “green” building
materials to lessen our impact on the environment.
Objective 7.1: Encourage the use of durable materials and
construction methods that prolong the life of buildings. A
paradigm shift is necessary to change the current 30-year life
expectancy of commercial buildings and some production
homes to a more substantial life expectancy. Carmel has
already had some success in encouraging 100-year buildings. For instance, that standard is currently being applied to
several buildings in the City Center and the Old Town Arts
and Design District.
Objective 7.2: Continue the policy emphasizing that City
vehicles be energy efficient and low emission cars and
trucks. With the introduction of hybrid vehicles, the City
now has a viable and visible means for improving the environment through energy conservation. Also, idling should
be discouraged when possible.
Objective 7.3: Develop a bicycle network to allow nonvehicular trips to be made by encouraging small-scale and
requiring large-scale employment nodes to install covered
and secure bicycle parking, and shower and changing
facilities for cycling commuters. Concurrently, ensure that
adequate bicycling facilities exist to allow safe and efficient
bicycle commuting.
Objective 7.4: The City should encourage use of water-saving
devices, and request that citizens reduce water consumption by proper (“smart”) lawn sprinkling and exploring
alternative landscapes which require less water. Encourage
rainwater (i.e. grey water) recycling to reduce potable water
consumption.
Objective 7.5: Strongly encourage developers to build
environmentally sensitive buildings, such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) guidelines or
similar programs. These “green” buildings conserve energy
resources, provide more healthful inside environments, last
longer, utilize products made from recycled material, and
use products that can be safely disposed of or recycled when
the building is eventually dismantled. Green buildings
also strive to use local material to reduce the transportation
impact. For instance, importing marble from overseas has
an enormous environmental impact compared to delivering
Indiana limestone from southern counties.
Objective 7.6: Set the precedent for environmental protection
or re-vegetation when developing municipal facilities like
parks, fire stations, and maintenance facilities.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
Objective 7.7: Continue to protect regional surface and
ground water sources to ensure safe drinking water for
Carmel and adjacent municipalities. Institute regulations
that further protect the delineated wellhead protection areas
from contaminants and land uses that have a higher risk of
contaminating water resources.
Objective 7.8: Set the precedent for environmentally sensitive
buildings when developing municipal facilities by striving
for the highest feasible level of LEED certification. Also
encourage other public entities to achieve the same.
Objective 7.9: Develop and maintain an Environmental Action
Plan to implement actions that reduce pollution, conserve
energy, and preserve the natural environment.
Objective 7.10: Explore the use of alternate sources of energy
such as active solar, geothermal, and wind.
Objective 7.11: Reduce heat island effect by preservation of
Carmel’s urban forest and by encouraging the use surfaces
that retard the absorption of heat.
Objective 7.12: Increase effectiveness of wastewater treatment
and discharge by combining master plans of both sanitary
sewer districts.
Objective 7.13: Reduce unnecessary removal of trees on lots,
encourage preservation of mature trees, and require replacement of trees that have to be removed for development.
Objective 7.14: Promote the movement toward sustainable
development and architecture. Encourage land developments and building designs that use or reuse land responsibly by discouraging patterns of sprawl, conserving potable
water, reducing energy consumption, and utilizing reusable
or recyclable materials. Encourage architects and designers
to use green design standards, such as LEED (Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design), to promote sustainable
and healthful buildings and neighborhoods for people to
shop, work, eat, recreate, and live.

Policy 8: Inspire Healthful Living

Introduction: Inspiring healthful living is a response to the
obesity rate in Indiana and the Midwest, and also recognizes
increases in cancer rates, lung diseases, heart disease, and
stress related disorders.
Objective 8.1: Strive to provide multiple types of facilities for
exercise, opportunities to immerse oneself into nature, sport
facilities and leagues, access to recreation programs, access
to health education programs, and encouragement to succeed
in one’s personal health goals.
Objective 8.2: Work corroboratively with local hospitals to
offer outreach services, health and wellness clinics, screenings, classes, smoking cessation programs, dietary support,
mental health clinics, immunization programs, and the like.
Objective 8.3: Encourage mixed-use, compact development
making it easier for people to walk or ride their bicycles.
This will provide a healthy lifestyle by providing the option
for exercise in people’s daily routines.
Objective 8.4: Develop programs and improve infrastructure
to encourage children to walk or ride their bicycles to
school. This will increase their physical activity, improve
their health, and will potentially reduce the automobile trips
made to and from school.
Objective 8.5: Promptly work to obtain park land while
undeveloped land is still available.

Objective 7.15: Due to increasing interest in redeveloping
previously-developed areas, the City would like to conduct
inventories, analyses, and cleanups of its brownfields. This
will serve to facilitate redevelopment in several areas, as
well as making the City healthier and more sustainable. The
City will also be working with citizens and professionals to
identify and prioritize brownfields.

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Introduction

Objective 6.1: Reinforce suburban character including treelined curvilinear streets, sidewalks separated by tree lawns,
and neighborhood parks. Also, maintain the dominant
presence of high quality single-family residential form.

Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Objective 6.2: Allow density transitions from single-family
residential form along East 96th Street and 146th Street , but
encourage context sensitive buffer development along these
corridors to help soften the visual impact to lower density
residential neighborhoods.

The following sections convey the policies and objectives
for the East Carmel District. It is important to note that
these sections share some of the same policy headings as the
City-Wide section, but the content is specific to East Carmel.
Objective 1.1: Protect the integrity of the suburban form and
land uses. East Carmel is an area where redevelopment
of residential districts is discouraged, and where investment in single-family homes is strongly encouraged. The
City will identify projects, policies, and programs that will
maintain the existing stability and encourage investment by
homeowners.
Objective 1.2: Allow neighborhood service nodes in context
appropriate areas. The objective of these nodes is to allow
limited neighborhood-serving commercial, mixed-use, and
public amenities within walking distance to residents living
in surrounding suburban neighborhoods. Lighting, parking,
architecture, landscaping, size of buildings, and bicycle and
pedestrian facilities will be strictly regulated to help ensure
the nodes blend in with existing residential uses.

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

Objective 2.1: Embrace the White River Greenway and
off-street trail to provide another notable linear park and
non-motorized transportation corridor which connects parks
as well as acting as the foundation for a larger, regional
greenway. More off-street trails are expected to contribute
to the overall network of paths, especially in the natural
corridor of the White River.
Objective 2.2: Promote a high quality mixed-use neighborhood
development on the Legacy property, achieving the same
recognition as the Village of WestClay. Unique uses or a
combination of uses should be designed into the context
of the natural environment and surrounding suburban
development.

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Policy 4: Be a City of Neighborhoods

Objective 4.1: South Central Carmel should be planned as
a collection of neighborhoods applying select traditional
neighborhood design principles to the historic suburban
form. Particularly, the principles of connectivity, transitions, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities would benefit this
district.
Objective 4.2: Endeavor to plan neighborhoods, gateways,
boundaries, and service areas through more detailed subarea
plans.

Policy 5: Be an Adaptable City

(no additional objectives apply to South Central Carmel)

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Introduction

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

The following sections convey the policies and objectives
for West Carmel. It is important to note that these sections
share some of the same policy headings as the City-wide
section, but the content under each heading is specific to
West Carmel and adds to other City-wide objectives.

Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Objective 1.1: Preserve the estate character of West Carmel
by protecting large-lot residential areas and by requiring
new subdivisions to have large setbacks from and quality
landscaping along perimeter roads. Further, require extensive re-vegetation along perimeter roads and within each
new development. A larger open space requirement should
also be considered.
Objective 1.2: Conservation subdivisions and innovative
residential community designs that protect vegetation, slopes
and are non-monotonous in terms of architecture and material selection are preferred.

Objective 2.1: Maintain and protect sub-areas in the City
of Carmel for estate character housing. These areas are
essential to attracting high quality businesses, providing the
desired quality-of-life for senior employees.
Objective 2.2: Encourage more custom home developments
to balance the housing inventory which has been slanting in
recent years toward production homes. Custom home neighborhoods will also add character to West Carmel by reducing
monotony. Concurrently, allow carriage houses and other
compatible forms of accessory dwellings to provide flexibility and a range of housing options.
Objective 2.3: Adopt residential architecture standards to
ensure compatibility, a high quality aesthetic, energy
efficiency, and durability.

Policy 3: Perpetuate Economic Vitality

(no additional objectives apply to West Carmel)

Objective 1.3: Subdivision connectivity and transitions
between proposed developments and existing subdivisions
should be scrutinized to a greater degree in West Carmel.

Policy 4: Be a City of Neighborhoods

Objective 1.4: West Carmel has many non-connecting subdivisions. The proliferation of this pattern of development is
more tolerable in this district; however, critical connections
shown on the Thoroughfare Plan will be absolutely required.
Although there is less emphasis on vehicular connectivity,
bicycle and pedestrian connectivity will be strictly required.
For instance, where road connectivity between a proposed
development and an existing development is not required,
bicycle and pedestrian connections will be required.

(no additional objectives apply to West Carmel)

Objective 1.5: With the success of the Monon Greenway,
other off-street facilities are in demand. West Carmel has an
opportunity to utilize portions of several pipeline corridors
for such a trail. These corridors are shown as off-street trails
in the 2020 Vision Plan and in the Alternative Transportation Plan initially adopted in 2001, and are supported in the
C3 Plan as well. Integrating this type of facility in some
areas will be relatively easy, but in already built environments may prove to be more difficult.
Objective 1.6: Carmel should partner with neighboring
Westfield and Zionsville to plan and implement a significant
greenway along Little Eagle Creek.

(no additional objectives apply to West Carmel)

Policy 5: Be an Adaptable City

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Objective 6.1: Reinforce rural character including tree lines,
fence rows, barns, pockets of open space, and preservation
of wood lots. Residential intensity can exist, but generally
should not be obviously portrayed from perimeter roads.
Objective 6.2: Protect single-family residential character along
West 96th Street between Spring Mill Road and Shelbourne
Road.
Objective 6.3: Require commercial buildings along Michigan
Road to be constructed of durable materials and designed to
reflect “village” character. Continue to strengthen the existing zoning ordinance overlay to implement the requirements.
Objective 6.4: Require large setbacks and lot sizes, and only
residential, institutional, and park uses along 116th Street
from Spring Mill Road west to the Boone County Line.
Utilize the existing zoning ordinance overlay to implement.

Policy 7: Inspire Environmental Awareness

Objective 7.1: Strive to protect woodlots, wetlands, and other
valuable natural features in West Carmel. These features
contribute to the district’s rural character, but they also
provide habitat for plants, birds, and other animals.

Policy 8: Inspire Healthful Living

Objective 8.1: Promptly work to obtain park land in the north
western portion of Clay Township while undeveloped land is
still available.

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
TRANSPORTATION PLAN INTRODUCTION
Part 4: Transportation Plan is inclusive of vehicular,
bicycle, pedestrian, and mass transportation. The City of
Carmel recognizes that improving and establishing multiple
modes of transportation is essential to further its evolution to
a high quality edge city.
The C3 Plan is the first of its kind to be inclusive of all
mainstream transportation modes. The City is making
the conscious decision to emphasize multiple modes
of transportation to complement traditional vehicular
transportation. Multi-modal transportation is increasingly
desirable because residents want bicycle and pedestrian
connectivity (e.g. Multi-use Paths) to local amenities,
commuters want alternatives (e.g. light rail) for travel
to work, and life-style changes are demanding more
recreational facilities (e.g. Monon Greenway).
To address each mode of transportation, this Part is divided
into the following three sections:
1. Thoroughfare Plan............................................ pg 49
2. Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan................. pg 63
3. Transit Plan....................................................... pg 75

Thoroughfare Plan

The Thoroughfare Plan identifies and describes the
recognized street classifications. It also includes the
20-Year Thoroughfare Plan Map which applies those
street classifications to every street in Carmel’s planning
jurisdiction. The application of street classifications is
designed to result in the effective connectivity and efficient
flow of traffic.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan

The Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan identifies and
describes the facilities designed for bicycle and pedestrian
use. It also includes the Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan
Map which denotes where each type of facility is intended to
be installed or maintained to achieve effective connectivity.

Transit Plan

The Transit Plan identifies and describes the transit system
and facilities desired by the City of Carmel. The transit
system is currently in the planning stages, so the content of
this Plan is meant to support the ongoing desire to establish
a commuter line to downtown Indianapolis and intra-city
transportation.

48

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
THOROUGHFARE PLAN
The City’s 20-Year Thoroughfare Plan focuses on multimodal transportation systems. The Thoroughfare Plan first
identifies and describes recognized street classifications. It
then applies those street classifications to every street in the
City’s planning jurisdiction on the Thoroughfare Plan Map.

Street Classifications and Descriptions
The following street classifications are used on the
Thoroughfare Plan Map:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Parkway Arterial Street..................................... pg 54
Urban Collector Street...................................... pg 55
Collector Street................................................. pg 56
Parkway Collector Street.................................. pg 57
Local Street....................................................... pg 58

Each of the street classifications listed above has a page
dedicated to describing how it can be used to convey
vehicular traffic and how it fits into the fabric of the City.
Further, the following headings are used, as described
below, to convey the essence of each street classification:
General Description: This section gives a brief description of
why the street classification has been established.
Street Features: This section conveys the primary design
standards that make each street classification unique. The
standards include: minimum right-of-way, maximum number
of lanes, minimum lane widths, medians, curbs, pedestrian
facilities, minimum pedestrian facility width, bicycle lanes,
minimum bicycle lane width, on-street parking, minimum
tree lawn, and street trees.
Typical Cross Section: This section references a typical cross
section illustration of the street classification. The illustration is intended to portray the purest applied version of the
street. When applied in the real world, variations in the
design may be necessary.

Design Priorities: During the design phase of all street
improvement projects, decisions have to be made to best
meet budgetary constraints, timelines, funding cycles,
physical constraints, and political constraints. This section
communicates the primary and secondary priorities for each
street classification. Primary priorities are those that should
not be foregone in design decisions. Secondary priorities are
those that may be considered for compromise, non-inclusion,
or later phases of the project.
Traffic Management Options: This section describes vehicular
traffic management options to consider when improving
a street. The options listed are intended to identify the
most appropriate means to intersect streets, slow traffic (if
appropriate), increase traffic efficiency (when appropriate),
and improve safety.
Effect of Annexation Agreement: Spring Mill Road, Ditch Road,
Shelborne Road and Town Road between 116th and 96th
Streets, and 106th Street between Commerce Drive and
Spring Mill Road, shall be designated as Collector Streets.
No other information in the C3 Plan shall be construed as
superseding this section.

Conservation Corridors Priorities:

Along context-sensitive transportation corridors, the City
has designated Conservation Corridors and imposes the
following priorities to protect private property, privacy,
environmental features, and unique aesthetic qualities of
the corridor. When planning for or designing City-funded
Transportation Changes to Conservation Corridors the
priorities are as follows:
• Priority 1: Under all circumstances corridor
improvements will be designed to the minimum required
for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian safety.
• Priority 2: Under all circumstances, the installation and
maintenance of public utilities and storm water facilities
shall be accommodated.
• Priority 3: Corridor improvements will be designed
to minimize negative impacts on private residential
properties relative to property value, privacy, and
encroachment.
• Priority 4: Design streets, bicycle and pedestrian facilities
with the lowest impact that is necessary to meet the
current and future demands.
• Priority 5: Design streets, bicycle and pedestrian facilities
to avoid removal of mature or significant trees and
vegetation.
• Priority 6: Add or replace trees and vegetation after
facility improvements are made to buffer private
residential properties and/or to replace trees and
vegetation that were removed for construction.
• Priority 7: Achieve priorities 3 through 5 above by
installing a pedestrian facility on only one side of the
street, where appropriate.
• Priority 8: Achieve priorities 3 through 5 above by
narrowing the typical tree lawns, where appropriate.
• Priority 9: Include adjacent and nearby private residential
property owners in early design discussions.

STREET CLASSIFICATION COMPARISON

THOROUGHFARE PLAN MAP DESCRIPTION

The below table provides a quick reference for comparing
the different street classifications. The information in
the below table mirrors the content in each of the street
classification descriptions on the previous pages.

The Thoroughfare Plan Map (on the next page) applies
a street classification to each street in Carmel’s planning
jurisdiction. The applied street classification represents what
the street will evolve to be over the course of 20 years, not
as it currently exists.
The Thoroughfare Plan Map also denotes where new streets
are necessary to fulfill the C3 Plan’s goals to mitigate
traffic and promote ease of travel by all modes. These
new streets should be viewed as mandatory when land is
being developed adjacent to or inclusive of the new street’s
proposed location. However, the dashed lines should also be
considered approximate alignments subject to site-specific
obstacles, street design practices, adjacent land uses, and
other real-world conditions.
The Thoroughfare Plan Map includes two additional street
classifications; Interstate and U.S./State Highway. These
classifications are not described in the preceding pages due
to the City of Carmel not having jurisdiction over those
transportation facilities.
See the Bike and Pedestrian Facilities Plan for non-vehicular
facility descriptions.

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITY PLAN
The City’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan focuses on
facilities for non-motorized transportation. These facilities
provide a means for people to get where they are going
without using their vehicles (i.e. for commuting). As a
result, bicycle and pedestrian facilities help mitigate traffic
throughout the City while improving the health of residents.
Another primary purpose for bicycle and pedestrian
facilities is to provide a means for people who cannot drive
vehicles (e.g. youth, blind, and seniors) to safely get to local
destinations. For this reason, all bicycle and pedestrian
facilities are intended to accommodate all handicap
accessible devices.
The secondary purpose for bicycle and pedestrian facilities
is fitness training and general recreation. People desirous
of a healthy life-style need facilities to safely walk, run,
skate/blade, or cycle. The City of Carmel realizes not all
bicycle and pedestrian facilities are designed for all types
of fitness activities (e.g. fitness cycling is not appropriate
on sidewalks). Therefore, multiple bicycle and pedestrian
facilities may be necessary in the same right-of-way to
accommodate different fitness activities.

Bicycle/Pedestrian Facility Classifications and Descriptions

The following bicycle and pedestrian facility classifications
are used on the Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Plan Map:
1.
2.
3.
4.

7.

Residential Sidewalk......................................... pg 64
Urban Residential Sidewalk.............................. pg 65

Multi-use Path................................................... pg 67
On-Street Bicycle Lane .................................... pg 68
Off-Street Urban Trail........................................ pg 69
Off-Street Trail................................................... pg 70

Image Example: This section references images of each
bicycle and pedestrian facility classification. The images
are intended to portray some of the best examples available
in Carmel, but might not represent the purest intent of the
facility. When applied in the real world, variations in the
design may also be necessary.
Design Priorities: During the design phase of all bicycle and
pedestrian facility improvement projects, decisions have to
be made to best meet budgetary constraints, timelines, funding cycles, physical constraints, and public opinions. This
section communicates the primary and secondary priorities for each bicycle and pedestrian facility classification.
Primary priorities are those that should not be foregone in
design decisions. Secondary priorities are those that maybe
considered for compromise, non-inclusion, or later phases.
Safety Enhancements: This section describes bicycle and
pedestrian safety options to consider when installing or
improving a facility. The enhancements listed are intended
to identify the most appropriate for the subject facility.
Effect of Annexation Agreement: Along Spring Mill Road, Ditch
Road, Shelborne Road, Town Road (between 116th and
96th Streets), and 106th Street (between Commerce Drive
and Spring Mill Road), Carmel intends to install Multi-use
Paths on both sides of Collector Streets. The timing and
final design of Multi-use Paths will depend on topography,
availability of right-of-way, and environmental constraints.
No other information in the C3 Plan shall be construed as
superseding this section.

Each of the bicycle and pedestrian facility classifications
listed above has a page dedicated to describing how it can be
used to convey bicycle and pedestrian traffic and how it fits
into the fabric of the City. Further, the following headings
are used, as described below, to convey the essence of each
bicycle and pedestrian facility classification:
General Description: This section gives the reader a brief
description of why the bicycle and pedestrian facility classification has been established.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facility Features: This section conveys the
primary design standards that make each bicycle and pedestrian facility classification unique. The standards include:
right-of-way, minimum facility width, construction material,
joints, obstructions, and street separation.

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN PLAN MAP
The Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan Map (on page 75) applies
the bicycle and pedestrian facility classifications throughout
Carmel’s planning jurisdiction. The bicycle and pedestrian
facility classifications represent the future system, not what
exists today.
The Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan Map is used to denote
where new bicycle and pedestrian facilities are necessary
to fulfill the C3 Plan’s goals to mitigate traffic and promote
ease of travel by all modes. These bicycle and pedestrian
facilities should be viewed as mandatory when land is being
developed adjacent to or inclusive of the new facility’s
proposed location.

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
TRANSIT PLAN
The City is actively in pursuit of a means to convey
commuters between key locations in Carmel, Hamilton
County, and Indianapolis. The City also has interest in
an intra-city system to allow people to travel between key
destinations in the City without using their own automobile.
The primary purpose of these interests is to mitigate traffic
on arterial streets and highways. The accomplishment of
a regional commuter line and intra-city system would also
help nurture the integrity of the natural environment by
reducing emissions and consumption of petroleum products.
It is suggested that a commuter line can not only mitigate
traffic congestion, but can reduce commute times to
downtown. Collectively, these benefits are expected to make
a commuter line an attractive option for those who work in
downtown Indianapolis but live in Carmel or vice versa.

Transit Facility Classifications and Descriptions

The following transit classifications are used on the Transit
Plan Map:
1. Commuter Line................................................. pg 76
2. Intra-city Transportation.................................... pg 77

Each of the transit facility classifications listed above has a
page dedicated to describing how it can be used to mitigate
traffic and how it fits into the fabric of the City. Further, the
following headings are used, as described below, to convey
the essence of each transit facility classification:
General Description: This section gives the reader a brief
description of why the transit classification has been
established.
Design Priorities: This section conveys the primary design
standards that should apply to each type of transit to make it
successful.

A secondary purpose for a commuter line and intra-city
system is to provide accessibility to disabled persons, youth,
seniors, and others who cannot, or do not wish to, drive.
Many factors contribute to the viability of any transit system.
For instance, the cost of gasoline influences potential
ridership, thus the revenue stream. Other factors include:
• gross residential population of the communities being
served,
• density of population near transit station,
• number of workers and residents within a 5 minute walk
of a transit station,
• design of the system (e.g. raised or at-grade),
• cost per ride,
• percent of system being subsidized by the government,
• convenience of system (e.g. transit stations near desired
destination),
• frequency of transit vehicles (i.e. wait time for boarding),
• actual and perceived degree of safety and security,
• time riding transit verses driving car, and
• availability of parking areas.
This section of the C3 Plan is intended to explore transit
opportunities to meet the needs of a developing and
redeveloping community. It is not intended to encourage
high density for the sake of establishing a transit system.

CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

75

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
COMMUTER LINE
General Description

A Commuter Line would be designed to carry a large
number of people from key locations in Carmel to one or
more destinations in downtown Indianapolis. Additional
stops en route to downtown Indianapolis may also be
necessary.
The interim express bus system should continue to be
supported and enhanced to mitigate traffic and provide
familiarity with commuter systems.
Currently the type of commuter line (e.g. raised monorail
or light rail) has not been conceptualized, nor has any
engineering or comprehensive study been completed to
choose a route into Carmel. Extensive study should be
conducted to determine an exact route, station locations,
scheduling, ridership, cost, phasing, ties to other
transportation systems, and type of “vehicle” to use. For that
reason this section is primarily a placeholder for revisions
and additions as further study is conducted. Everything
contained in this section should be considered conceptual
and preliminary.

MetroLink in St. Louis is an example of light rail. The electric
powered system uses overhead power lines for energy.

Design Priorities

• Commuter stops should take the form of stations with
shelters, waiting areas, and bicycle parking.
• Stations in Carmel should be located in areas with
intense employment and large parking capacity, or dense
populations living within walking distance.
• Destinations for commuters to include Keystone at the
Crossing and downtown Indianapolis.
• “Express” commute time to downtown Indianapolis.
• “Vehicles” should provide the space for passengers to
transport their bicycles.

The Clarian People Mover was installed in Indianapolis to better
link hospital campuses to one another. This system represents an
automated and raised rail system.

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Office uses the above
image to describe an at-grade automated rail system. The location
of the system is unknown.

76

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
INTRA-CITY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
General Description

A Intra-city Transportation System would be designed to
carry a moderate number of people between key locations
in Carmel. Additional routes may include key locations
in Zionsville, Noblesville, Indianapolis, Westfield, and/or
Fishers. Most likely, this system would be a driver-operated,
on-street system.
Currently the type of Intra-city Transportation System (e.g.
trolly or bus) has not been conceptualized, nor has any
comprehensive study been conducted to determine an onstreet system of routes and stops. Extensive study should be
conducted to determine potential routes, stops, scheduling,
ridership, cost, phasing, ties to other transportation systems,
and type of vehicles. For that reason this section is primarily
a placeholder for revisions and additions as further study is
conducted. Everything contained in this section should be
considered conceptual and preliminary.

The New Flyer brand hybrid electric bus represents the latest
technology in low floor (for easy in and out) and low emission
transit vehicles. Buses like this could match Carmel’s commitment
to a fleet of fuel efficient and low emissions vehicles.

Design Priorities

• Intra-city stops should take the form of “turnouts” to
provide safe ingress and egress from the vehicle.
• Turnouts in Carmel should be located at popular
destinations like Old Town, City Center, Clay Terrace,
U.S. 31 office parks, Merchants’ Square, Central Park,
and strategic locations near higher density residential
developments.
• Convenience of schedule and efficiency in time.
• User-friendly and predictable.
• Driver operated.

Some communities desire themed buses so riders can quickly
recognize them and to fit better into the context. This trolly bus is
used in Central Park in New York City.

Compact buses, like this one used in Long Beach, California,
provide lower up-front cost and are more maneuverable in urban
environments.

CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

77

PART 4: TRANSPORTATION PLAN
TRANSIT FACILITY PLAN
A Transit Facility Plan should be prepared to identify
potential routes using key corridors. The Transit Facility
plan would also identify high density or intense nodes that
would benefit from a transit stop. Once prepared the Transit
Facility Plan can help promote proper development where
transit stops will most likely be located, and to discourage
incompatible land uses from locating adjacent to routes or
near transit stops.
The Transit Facility Plan Map, when prepared, should be
located on the following page.

CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
INTRODUCTION
Part 5: Critical Corridors and Subareas has been
established to provide a summary of several planning studies
and small area plans. The following sections represent
the essence of those studies and plans, and add greater
refinement to transportation and growth management goals
and objectives.
The purpose of this Part is to emphasize that there are certain
areas and corridors in the City that require a greater degree
of planning. They also require a greater level of review
when development proposals are being considered.
The following critical corridors and subareas are included in
this Part:
1.
2.

The above listed critical corridors and subareas do not
correlate with “overlays” in the City’s zoning ordinance.
The C3 Plan only includes comprehensive plan amendments.

Critical Corridor and Subarea Descriptions

Each of the critical corridors and subareas listed above has
two to six pages dedicated to describing how it should be
used to manage growth and development in these sensitive
areas. Further, the following headings are used, as described
below, to convey the essence of each critical corridor and
subarea. These descriptions are intended to be conceptual.
Description: This section gives the reader a brief description
of the existing conditions, history, and reasons why the
corridor or subarea is considered critically important.
Critical Area Boundaries: This section conveys where each
critical corridor or subarea is located within Carmel’s
planning jurisdiction.
Strategy: This section describes the implementation steps,
projects, policies, or programs necessary to achieve the
desired result in the critical corridor or subarea.
Design Guidelines: This section establishes the physical
goals for the critical corridor or subarea. It should be
referenced and used to influence decisions made by the
Plan Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, and Common
Council when considering a development proposal.

82

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Plan Map: Each critical corridor or subarea has a full-page
illustration of the area within its boundaries. The map is
included to support the “Strategy” and “Design Guidelines”
sections and to illustrate additional information not included
in the written text. In many of the maps, the Bicycle and
Pedestrian Plan Map information and Thoroughfare Plan
Map information is integrated.
In some critical corridor and subarea sections, a “Detailed”
Plan Map is included. The inclusion of such a map is
indication that those critical corridors or subareas have had
more extensive study and planning.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
FUTURE STUDIES AND PLANS
The critical corridors and subareas plans included in Part 5 are
the result of detailed studies or planning efforts previously
completed by the City of Carmel. Therefore, the content
in Part 5 is limited to just those previous studies. The City
recognizes that there are several other “critical” areas in its
planning jurisdiction that remain to be studied or planned
for in detail. It is anticipated that the City will work toward
accomplishing those planning processes as time and budget
permit, and based on impending need.

Potential New Critical Corridors and Subareas

The critical corridors and subareas that may be studied and
planned for include, but are not limited to the following (in
no particular order):
1. West 116th Street
2. East 116th Street
3. 146th Street
4. Michigan Road/U.S. 421
5. East 96th Street
6. Downtown Core
7. White River Greenway
8. Transit Integration and Hub
9. 126th Street and Gray Road District
10. Quarry Land Reclamation and Development
11. Pennsylvania Parkway Extension
12. Hazel Dell Parkway and 131st Street District
13. Monon Greenway Corridor
14. Central Park District

Implementation and Incorporation of New Critical Corridor or
Subarea Plans

It is the desire of the City to formalize a general process and
scope of services to be used for each new critical corridor
or subarea planning project. The intent is to assure public
participation and adherence to a document format that will
allow the results to be integrated into the C3 Plan on two to
eight pages. This will help maintain a uniform, compact and
user-friendly comprehensive plan over the years to come.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
KEYSTONE PARKWAY CORRIDOR
Description

Keystone Parkway has been identified as a critical corridor
because it:
• Serves as major north/south arterial;
• Establishes a division between the urbanizing central part
of Carmel and primarily residential neighborhoods in East
Carmel; and
• Is buffered by long stretches of mature trees providing
aesthetic benefit.
The volume of traffic on Keystone Parkway has increased;
additionally, many intersecting streets have experienced
increasing volumes of traffic. The addition of traffic has
increased the time it takes to traverse the township. During
certain parts of the day, the corridor has backed-up traffic
and is noted by residents as being a transportation concern.

Critical Area Boundaries

The Keystone Parkway Corridor boundaries are depicted on
the Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Gain Control of the Right-of-Way: Through an agreement with
the State of Indiana the City of Carmel successfully gained
full control over Keystone Parkway, reverting it to a City
controlled street instead of a State Road.
Install Grade-Separated Roundabouts: Now that the City has
control of the right-of-way, it will achieve grade separation
at key intersections. The most logical design for grade
separation is a roundabout configuration to control the
turning movements of vehicles entering or exiting Keystone
Parkway. This design will require much less right-of-way
acquisition, thereby minimizing disturbance to adjacent
properties. The result will be significant reductions in traffic
congestion, travel times, and vehicular accidents. The flow
of traffic traveling north or south along Keystone will be
uninhibited by stop lights.
Assure East/West Connectivity: As a major arterial, Keystone
Parkway acts as a barrier for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
The City will install grade-separated bicycle and pedestrian
crossings to support east/west connectivity and improve
convenience and safety.
Preserve and Install Tree Canopy: Carmel will maintain the
overlay language in its zoning regulations to protect the
existing tree canopy. It will also require installation of
new canopy trees when appropriate to maintain the “green
corridor” aesthetic.

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Install Side Paths: There is an ever-increasing demand for
bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Carmel. The Keystone
Parkway Corridor will provide a tremendous opportunity for
side paths to be added within the existing right-of-way. With
the Monon Greenway functioning at capacity at times, the
Keystone Parkway Corridor would provide another northsouth route for bicycles and pedestrians. With a connection
between the Monon Greenway at the north (see Keystone
Parkway Corridor Plan) and south, a highly desirable circuit
would be created.
Require Connection between Carmel Drive and Mohawk Drive: As
areas between Carmel Drive and Mohawk Drive develop and
redevelop, the City will require a strong street connection to
relieve use of Keystone Parkway. This requirement reflects
the existing and highly used connection (AAA Way) from
116th Street to Carmel Drive.

Design Guidelines

• Protect and enhance the green corridor aesthetic.
• Assure safe means for bicycles and pedestrians to cross
Keystone Parkway.
• Protect existing residential neighborhoods along Keystone
Parkway from conflicting land use encroachment.
• Use Keystone Parkway to soften the effects of
commercial development for residential neighborhoods.
• Add aesthetic character to grade-separated roundabouts so
they maintain a pleasant and context-sensitive corridor.
• Minimize and discourage unplanned expansion
of commercial uses in the corridor. Commercial
character should be buffered from nearby and adjacent
neighborhoods with appropriate landscaping, building
placement, etc.
• Plan for mass transit by encouraging mixed-use hubs with
appropriate residential densities.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
U.S. 31 CORRIDOR
Description

The U.S. 31 Corridor has been identified as a critical
corridor because it:
• Serves as major regional north/south arterial;
• Provides an abrupt transition between the urbanizing
central part of Carmel and sensitive low density
residential neighborhoods and estates;
• Creates an undesirable barrier for east/west vehicular,
bicycle, and pedestrian transit; and
• Is a major employment corridor and economic engine.
U.S. 31 is slated to be upgraded to freeway status, requiring
interchanges as the only access points. This is a positive
improvement to reduce traffic congestion, yet will result
in numerous challenges as well. For instance, Carmel will
likely lose some access points along the corridor.
It will be important for Carmel to maintain sufficient
access to U.S. 31 and to ensure the City’s character is not
compromised. Further, it will be important to provide
numerous means for east/west access for vehicles, bicycles,
and pedestrians.

Critical Area Boundaries

Maintain Strong East/West Connectivity: As a major arterial,
U.S. 31 acts as a barrier for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
When the highway is upgraded to freeway status, it may also
reduce east/west connectivity for vehicles. The City will
work with the State of Indiana to establish six interchanges
and three overpasses for adequate vehicular, bicycle, and
pedestrian access. Two additional bicycle and pedestrian
grade-separated crossings are necessary.
Require 6 to 10 Story Buildings: Require all buildings in the
employment corridor to be 6 to 10 stories in height, and
3 to 5 stories (not to exceed 60 feet) when between 106th
Street and 111th Street west of U.S. 31 (see illustration
below). However, building heights should be reduced as
they encroach on Illinois Street and Pennsylvania Street; and
building heights should not exceed 3 stories when adjacent
to existing residential neighborhoods (see illustration
below). This office and medical corridor provides essential
employment opportunity and portrays a positive community
character. Parking areas should be de-emphasized and, when
appropriate structured to make room for additional buildings.
Limited opportunity for business-serving and employeeserving commercial should be allowed (e.g. restaurants and
print shops) in existing buildings or small nodes along the
corridor.

Design Guidelines

The U.S. 31 Corridor boundaries are depicted on the
Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Utilize Roundabout Interchanges: The City of Carmel will work
with the State of Indiana to ensure the use of roundaboutstyle interchanges. These interchange designs are expected
to save cost, reduce acquisition of land, disturb less of the
built environment, and best match the character goals of the
City. Another expected advantage is efficiency of vehicular
traffic, reducing emissions and fuel consumption.
Extend Illinois Street from 106th to 111th Street: As U.S. 31 is
upgraded, Illinois Street will be necessary to provide north/
south access to the employment corridor on the west side of
U.S. 31. Illinois Street also establishes the transition from
intense office corridor to low density residential areas to the
west.

2 Story Home

• Protect and enhance the green corridor aesthetic created
by large lawns and consistent landscaping.
• Ensure safe means for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross
U.S. 31.
• Transition the scale and mass of structures between U.S.
31 and Illinois Street to minimize impact to residential
development to the west.
• Require high quality, urban office architecture and campus
design between Illinois Street and Pennsylvania Street.
• Prohibit “branded” architecture.
• Allow clearly visible signs for major tenants.
• Encourage “green” architecture for all new buildings.
• Sensitively integrate amenity nodes along Illinois Street
and Pennsylvania Street for convenience and enjoyment
of corridor employees and nearby residents.
• Prepare for a context sensitive mass transit line.
• Respect transitions to adjacent neighborhoods and require
appropriate buffering.
• Integrate bicycle and pedestrian facilities along U.S. 31
Corridor.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
96TH STREET CORRIDOR
Description

The 96th Street Corridor has been identified as a critical
corridor because it:
• Serves as a major east/west arterial;
• Establishes a division between stable residential
neighborhoods and commercial areas; and
• Traverses in and out of sensitive neighborhoods.
Through the early 1960’s, 96th Street was an uninterrupted
cross-county connector between the Boone County line
and the White River. In the mid-sixties, Interstate 465 was
constructed resulting in the current disrupted configuration
near Westfield Boulevard. As northern Marion County
and southern Hamilton County urbanized, 96th Street’s
importance as a major east/west corridor was rekindled.
Today, 96th Street continues to evolve into a major arterial,
especially east of Keystone Parkway. In the study area of
the 96th Street Corridor Plan, there are three segments that
reflect commercial character and correspondingly carry
higher volumes of traffic:
• Between Michigan Road and Shelbourne Road;
• Between Spring Mill Road and College Avenue; and
• Between Westfield Boulevard and Keystone Parkway.
There are also two segments that maintain residential
character and carry lower volumes of traffic:
• Between Shelbourne Road and Spring Mill Road; and
• Between College Avenue and Westfield Boulevard.

Critical Area Boundaries

The 96th Street Corridor boundaries are depicted on the
Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Encourage Redevelopment Along Michigan Road: The City of
Carmel should encourage the redevelopment of property on
the northeast corner of Michigan Road and 96th Street. A
high quality development at this location would enhance this
gateway into Carmel. It is hoped that a quality development
in this strategic location will act as a catalyst for similar
quality to the south, north, and east where several “tired” and
under-utilized buildings are located.
Buffer Residential Areas from Commercial: As commercial areas
near Michigan Road evolve or are redeveloped, special
attention should be given to transitions, or softening
potential negative effects, to adjacent residential areas.

Enhance East/West Connectivity: Where 96th Street (the Real
Street leg) connects with Westfield Boulevard south of
I-465, the City of Carmel should look for ways to improve
connectivity to the new roundabout north of I-465 on
Westfield Boulevard. The best solution may be another
roundabout at Real Street (Marion County’s jurisdiction) at
Westfield Boulevard to allow for more fluid, uninterrupted
vehicle flow.
The above described enhancement is most likely the best
alternative when considering financial resources. However,
if the funding could be obtained, the City would prefer
a straight alignment over I-465, eliminating the need for
the Real Street segment (see Alternative Alignment on
the next page). Although this alignment would be more
costly, it would better enhance east/west connectivity, and
restore 96th Street to its original configuration prior to the
construction of I-465.
Connect Pennsylvania Parkway to Westfield Boulevard: This linkage
would likely help relieve traffic on 96th Street between
College Avenue and Westfield Boulevard. The right-of-way
for this street extension exists in some locations north of
I-465. An alternate east/west connection is reestablishing
the original alignment of 96th Street by building a new
bridge over I-465.
Install Side Paths: There is an ever-increasing demand for
bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Carmel. The 96th Street
Corridor provides an opportunity for Side Paths to be added
between the Monon Greenway and Keystone Parkway. With
the Monon Greenway functioning at capacity at times, the
96th Street Corridor would provide (once Side Paths are
installed on Keystone Parkway) a highly desirable circuit.
Maintain Residential Character: In the residential areas noted
on the 96th Street Corridor Plan, the City should maintain
a 2-lane configuration with residential sensitivity (e.g.
minimize right-of-way impacts, and add street trees and
Side Paths) for as long as possible. Based on the 96th Street
Corridor Study (1999), the 2-lane configuration would
result in congestion during some periods, but would be
manageable up to the year 2020.

Design Guidelines

• Protect and enhance residential character in the street
sections between Shelbourne Road and Spring Mill Road.
• Add Side Paths, especially along the north side of 96th
Street.
• Sensitively transition between commercial and residential
uses with vegetation, distance, screening, and buffering
land uses.

Because this corridor plan was completed in 1999, some influencing factors have changed.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
CITY CENTER/OLD TOWN SUBAREA
Description

The City Center and Old Town nodes have been identified as
a critical subarea because they:
• Collectively function as the City of Carmel’s core
downtown;
• Are going through substantial redevelopment; and
• Represent the City’s economic and cultural vitality.
Downtowns are special places, and Carmel’s is no exception.
Historically, the downtown functioned as the primary
location for commerce and pedestrian activity. Over time,
commercial development on the outskirts diverted much of
the vitality away from the downtown.
Carmel has recognized the importance of its downtown
and is redeveloping several parcels and encouraging
reinvestment. It is also striving to reintroduce many cultural
activities and capacity to the district.
Architectural character, bicycle and pedestrian amenities,
vitality anchors and connectivity will all be essential to its
success. The City recognizes that any modern downtown
must accommodate vehicles and will strive to include
parking areas in discrete locations.

Critical Area Boundaries

The City Center and Old Town boundaries are depicted on
the Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Form-Based Regulatory Ordinance: The City of Carmel will draft
and adopt a form-based code to regulate massing, scale,
intensity, building orientation and site features required for
new or redevelopment projects in the core. This form-based
regulation should be accompanied by a detailed plan for the
entire subarea.
The form-based code will replace the traditional zoning
ordinance, and will not focus heavily on regulating land use.

Enhance Connectivity: The historic grid system of local streets
was not expanded as growth occurred in the downtown.
Various developments over the years have become obstacles
for proper connectivity in the downtown. As the district
continues to be redeveloped and additional vehicular, bicycle
and pedestrian traffic is realized, the need for additional
connectivity will grow significantly. For this reason, the
City will seek opportunities to expand the grid or to make
new connections, especially with local streets.
Another essential connection is with the Monon Greenway.
The map on the opposite page demonstrates several potential
linkages the City intends to install.
Assure a Bicycle and Pedestrian-Friendly Environment: Downtowns
should be places where people feel comfortable and have
a desire to be. Beyond the obvious need for bicycle and
pedestrian amenities like benches, bicycle racks, interesting
paving material, safe street crossings, and pedestrian-scale
street lights, there are many other factors that make a person
interested in being downtown. The most notable are the
pedestrian interaction and street vitality.
Restaurants with outdoor seating, retail storefronts with
large windows, pocket parks or plazas, and other pedestrianoriented destinations are all essential. Ground floor offices,
some service businesses, and surface parking along the street
edge often distract from the pedestrian environment and will
be discouraged.
Signature Buildings: Carmel will work to achieve the
construction of “signature” buildings at key locations in Old
Town and City Center. These building sites are intended to
establish character precedent for the district and to act as a
catalyst for reinvestment and redevelopment. The proposed
building sites for signature buildings are also prominent
locations where a powerful architectural statement will
have a positive impression on visitors. See the following
illustration for proposed and existing signature building
sites.

Design Guidelines

• Ensure safe environment for bicycles and pedestrians,
especially at road and driveway crossings. A change in
paving material is a preferred method to signal to drivers
that they are in a pedestrian environment.
• Require ground floor elevations to have large transparent
windows for inside/outside interaction.
• Require dedication of right-of-way for the expansion of
the grid system of local streets.
• Encourage upper story residential or employment uses to
support pedestrian vitality at the street level.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
OLD MERIDIAN SUBAREA
Description

The Old Meridian Subarea has been identified as a critical
district because it:
• Is experiencing increased development pressure;
• Has a wide mix of land uses coming together in a small
area;
• Has a significant portion of the land left undeveloped or
underdeveloped;
• Is made up of a few permanent uses (e.g. Street Vincent’s
Carmel Hospital and Carmel Middle School) which
require some sensitivity;
• Has a significant demand for businesses to serve the
corporate corridor along U.S. 31; and
• Lacks a cohesive theme and unifying features.
The City of Carmel conducted a thorough market study of
the Old Meridian Subarea followed by a detailed physical
study (Old Meridian Task Force Report). The result of both
efforts was a vision, physical development plan, and land
use concept for the district.
The City has already improved Old Meridian Street into a
four-lane boulevard with roundabouts at critical locations.
The street improvements include a new landscaped median,
curbs, and sidewalks.

Critical Area Boundaries

The Old Meridian Subarea boundaries are depicted on the
Orientation Map on page 96.

Strategy

Old Meridian Street Boulevard: The City of Carmel upgraded
Old Meridian Street into a boulevard with roundabouts at
Pennsylvania Street, Grand Boulevard and Main Street. This
project sets the character for the district, enhances bicycle
and pedestrian access, and mitigates traffic.
Grand Boulevard and other Radial Boulevards: The City will build
Grand Boulevard and other secondary boulevards in the
locations depicted on the Old Meridian Subarea Plan. These
radial boulevards will offer park-like medians to support
bicycling and walking access to the Village area. They will
also provide cross-circulation for vehicles and high quality
settings for new development.

Townhouse and Multiple-family Uses: The Old Meridian Subarea
Plan envisions both upscale and more moderate units within
townhouses and multiple-family developments. These
residential developments are intended to be located along the
new boulevards.
Office Development: Outside the central retail and residential
areas, new office development is anticipated on the south
end of the subarea. This office development is intended to
be two to five stories, mostly fronting on Old Meridian Street.
Mixed Medical Development: The area north of Main Street
and south of St. Vincent’s Carmel Hospital is intended to
facilitate the development, expansion, and modernization of
a major hospital complex or campus. It is also intended to
include mixed uses that will support such a campus, including retail, restaurants, services, rehabilitation, and fitness
facilities.
Mixed-Use Village: The Old Meridian Village is intended to
be a concentrated mixed-use development with upper-floor
residential units. The Village will be a walkable atmosphere
and will offer cafes and entertainment for residents and
employees of nearby developments. Establishing a critical
mass of retail uses is essential.
District Character: The City of Carmel will encourage an urban
character similar to an old-fashioned village or Main Street.
Buildings will primarily be designed to front on boulevards
or secondary streets with vehicles de-emphasized by requiring parking in the rear of properties. Ground floor elevations
will generally be transparent glass, and buildings will have
distinct elevations with cornice lines with three-dimensional
details.

Single-Family Attached Design Guidelines

• Residential units should provide a minimum of two offstreet parking spaces, or one if on-street parking is ample.
• Off-street parking should be on a paved driveway or in an
attached or detached enclosed garage.
• All parking should be accessed from the rear of the unit.
• All buildings should face a public street.

Secondary Street Network: As development occurs, secondary streets will need to be installed as depicted on the
Old Meridian Subarea Plan. These streets are intended to
provide additional connectivity instead of dead-end driveways serving a single development. They also provide an
opportunity for buildings to face public streets with parking
in the rear of the property.
Large single-family homes with brick fronts, small yards, and
stoops are a good fit for the Single-family Attached subdistrict.

92

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
• Developments exceeding ten units should provide 15% of
the land area as open space, landscaped for enjoyment by
the residents.
• All local streets should accommodate on-street parking
and sidewalks according to Old Meridian Subarea Plan.
• All units should be vertically separated, between 25 to 35
feet in width, and two and one-half stories tall.
• Front facades should be clad in brick with threedimensional details.
• Front doors should face the street and be two to five feet
above sidewalk level.
• An articulated cornice should be provided where the top
of the facade meets the roof.
• If desired, a “transparent” fence (e.g. wrought iron) should
be allowed in the front yard.

• Use of balconies in the structure’s design.
• Courtyards may be fenced with wrought iron or metal
fences that are no more than five feet tall.
• Freestanding signs should be prohibited. All identification,
directional, or informational signs should be small and
located on the building or integrated onto a fence.

Multiple-Family Attached Design Guidelines

• All units should provide a minimum of two off-street
parking spaces, or one if on-street parking is ample.
• Surface parking or parking garages should not be adjacent
to or face a public street.
• At least 75% of all buildings in a development should
face a public street.
• Developments exceeding ten units should provide 15% of
the land area as open space, landscaped for enjoyment by
the residents.

Row homes are a suitable fit for the Single-family Attached
subdistrict.

• Buildings facing public streets should have a build-to
requirement, with facades being varied between four and
nine feet from the right-of-way. Off-street parking or
driveways should not be permitted in the front setback.
• All local streets should accommodate on-street parking
and sidewalks according to the Old Meridian Subarea
Plan.
• Buildings should be a minimum of 28 feet tall and a
maximum of 55 feet tall, except parking garages which
cannot exceed 35 feet in height.
• All units should be accessible from both the front and
back of the building.
• Front setbacks and courtyards should be finished with
sidewalks and extensive landscaping.

Multiple-family Attached development should face the street and
have on-street parking to accommodate visitors.

Mixed-Use Village Design Guidelines

• All ground floors should be retail, restaurant, or
entertainment uses except for lobby or transitional areas
to upper-floor residential units.
• Upper floors may be residential, office, or commercial
uses.
• Drive-through facilities should be prohibited.
• Parking should be provided at a one per 800 square feet
ratio of gross area in the building.
• Parking should be on-site or within 200 feet of the site
and shared parking will be considered; on-street parking
is encouraged but is excluded from calculations of
required spaces.
• All buildings should face the public street and at least one
main entrance to each ground floor use shall be on the
street side of the building.
• Curb cuts or parking lots should not be allowed on Old
Meridian Street.
• The buildings should sit on the front property line, except
for minor recessed areas (e.g. entrances).
• Pedestrian access to rear parking areas is encouraged and
should be at least eight feet wide.
• No single retail business should have more than 45 feet of
frontage on Old Meridian Street.
• Buildings must be a minimum of two stories and a
maximum of four stories, except parking garages which
should not exceed three stories.
• Ground floor elevations should be a minimum of 80%
transparent glass.
• Buildings should have a distinct cornice line at the top of
the wall and have intermediate horizontal elements.
• The general proportion of the building should be vertical.
• The primary articulation of the building should be threedimensional details rather than massing.
• In general, roofs should be flat or slightly sloped.

CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

93

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
• Ground floor tenants should be allowed one and one-half
square feet of sign area per lineal foot of building frontage
with a maximum of 32 square feet of sign area.
• Building signs should fit within the horizontal and vertical
elements of the building and should not obscure the
building’s architectural details.
• Signs should be mounted perpendicular to the facade
(blade signs) or flat-mounted on the facade.
• Signs should not extend above the height of the building,
but they can be on awnings or painted in storefront
windows or upper-floor windows. Signs on umbrellas or
other product branding should be restricted.
• Retractable fabric awnings may be used, but cannot
exceed the width of the windows or cover architectural
details of the building.
• Individual tenants should strive for a unique graphic identity
rather than be required to conform to a single standard.

Village Office Design Guidelines

• Primary uses should be office related.
• A small percentage of floor area may be dedicated to
small retail or restaurant uses.
• Drive-through facilities should be prohibited.

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
Mixed Medical Design Guidelines

• Primary uses should be inpatient and outpatient care
facilities, medical offices, rehabilitation, physical fitness,
long-term care, and related uses and support services.
• Up to 15% of the gross floor area may be dedicated to
retail or restaurant uses that support the aforementioned
uses.
• Drive-through facilities should be prohibited.
• Parking should be determined on a case-by-case basis due
to the uniqueness of these land uses.
• All buildings should face the public street and at least one
main entrance to each ground floor use should be on the
street side of the building.
• Curb cuts or parking lots should not be allowed along Old
Meridian Street.
• Buildings should be at least two stories, but no more than
five stories in height; except hospitals which may be 10
stories.
• The minimum footprint of any single building should
be 8,000 square feet and a general maximum of 20,000
square feet, excluding a hospital.
• Buildings facing public streets shall have a build-to
requirement, with facades being varied between 20 feet
and 30 feet from the right-of-way. No off-street parking
or driveways are permitted in the front setback.
• Buildings should be faced in brick, trimmed in metal,
stone, precast concrete, wood, or stucco. Large expanses
of glass should be permitted, but the structure should
not be predominantly glass and metal (e.g. curtain wall
construction). Concrete block should not be permitted.
• Facades that are wider than 50 feet shall have offsets
which divide the facade into meaningful sections such as
tenant spaces or entryways.
• Wall or ground signs should also be permitted, as per the
City’s ordinances.

Special Use Design Guidelines

• Primary uses should be public institutions (e.g. places of
worship or civic buildings).
• Commercial or office uses would also be fitting if the
architecture is iconic and contributes to the overall profile
of the corridor.
• Parking should be in line with other subdistricts, but will
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
• Buildings should be oriented to face the roundabout and
be set back 150 feet from the right-of-way.
• Buildings should have at least a 10,000 square foot
building footprint.
• Buildings should be at least three stories, but no
more than five stories, with the exception of certain
architectural elements such as steeples, towers, etc.
• Buildings should be constructed of substantial materials
consistent with an iconic and lasting structure.
• Substantial and attractive landscaping should be installed
in the setback facing the roundabout.

Buildings can be excellent focal points and landmarks at key
locations.

OLD MERIDIAN SUBAREA DETAIL PLAN

CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

97

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
HOME PLACE SUBAREA
Description

Home Place has been identified as a critical subarea because it:
• Is notably impacted by the evolution of the U.S. 31 and
I-465 corridors; and
• Is experiencing redevelopment pressure.
Home Place is particularly important because it is
recognized as a town-like enclave. Although it was never
incorporated as a town or city, many residents in the area,
especially long-time residents, desire to maintain Home
Place’s autonomy and identity.
Over recent years, Home Place has been under increasing
redevelopment pressure. Sites along I-465 have been
purchased and redeveloped into office uses; and other sites
like the Sunrise Golf Club are under increasing pressure to
redevelop.
The Home Place Subarea is inclusive of Central Park, which
will be one of the largest public parks in Carmel. This
substantial investment will be a nice amenity for Home
Place residents. It will likely also raise property values and
desirability of the district.

Critical Area Boundaries

The Home Place boundaries are depicted on the Orientation
Map on the following page.

Strategy

Connection between Pennsylvania Parkway and 96th Street: The
City of Carmel will work to connect Pennsylvania Parkway
to the new roundabout at 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard. This connection is considered an essential connection,
especially as U.S. 31 is upgraded to a freeway configuration.
A grade separated crossing with the Monon Greenway will
be necessary. Multi-use paths will also be essential along
the new street to provide access to the Monon Greenway and
other destinations.
Promote a Neighborhood-Serving Commercial District: At the core
of Home Place (College Avenue and 106th Street) is a commercial district that historically has been home to a grocery
store, gas stations, offices, institutional uses, and miscellaneous retail uses. The current uses do not function well as
neighborhood-serving commercial and are not as bicycle- or
pedestrian-friendly as they once were. The City of Carmel
will work to encourage more mixed-use development that
provides a more bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly environment and that provides goods and services to the residential
community within walking distance.

98

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Soften Transitions: As the U.S. 31 and I-465 develops with
higher intensity uses, the Home Place residential community
should be buffered through the use of transitional office
uses. These transitional areas should have structures that are
two or three stories in height and have roof designs that are
similar to residential developments. Further, parking areas
should be located away from residences and lighting should
be designed to not trespass into residential areas.

Design Guidelines

• Establish regulations to assure smooth transitions between
high intensity office areas and residential areas.
• Ensure development and redevelopment of the Home
Place core is comfortable and safe for bicycle and
pedestrians.
• Require buildings in the core to be built to the front
property line, have ground floor retail or office uses, and
have large transparent windows at ground level.
• Encourage upper story residential or employment uses in
the mixed-use core to support pedestrian vitality at the
street level.
• Protect the lake and woodland west of the Monon
Greenway and north of I-465 and encourage the use of the
land as a park.
• Install grade-separated crossings where the Monon
Greenway intersects with major roadways.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
96TH STREET AND WESTFIELD
BOULEVARD SUBAREA
Description

The 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard area has been
identified as a critical subarea because it:
• Is surrounded on three sides by major corridors: Westfield
Boulevard, 96th Street, and Keystone Parkway;
• Has stable neighborhoods that have been impacted by the
evolution of transportation facilities;
• Will likely be impacted by office/commercial
development of the land south of 96th Street controlled by
Indianapolis;
• Periodically experiences redevelopment pressure from the
private sector;
• Has areas that are not well drained; and
• Has limited bicycle and pedestrian connections to
regional amenities.
In recent years a new roundabout at 96th Street and Westfield
Boulevard was installed, a residential redevelopment project
was approved at 99th Street and Westfield Boulevard, and
the City of Carmel began reconstructing Keystone Parkway
into a grade-separated corridor.
In upcoming years, I-465 is planned to be reconstructed,
including the interchange with Keystone Parkway. The
intersection of Keystone Parkway and 96th Street is being
planned for grade separation and the Westfield Boulevard
bridge over I-465 is slated to be reconstructed. Also, 96th
Street is expected to be widened into a Primary Arterial
between Keystone Parkway and Haverstick Road, and to a
Primary Parkway between Haverstick Road and Westfield
Boulevard. Therefore, in the future, 96th Street will be
configured with a green median from Haverstick Road to
Westfield Boulevard; potentially with one “intersection” in
that segment for the undeveloped land south of the corridor
to have access to 96th Street.

Critical Area Boundaries

The 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard boundaries are
depicted on the Orientation Map on page 103.

Strategy

Connection between Pennsylvania Parkway and 96th Street: The
City of Carmel will work to connect Pennsylvania Parkway
to the roundabout at 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard.
This connection is considered an essential connection,
especially as U.S. 31 is upgraded to a freeway configuration.
Install Side Paths: There is an ever-increasing demand for
bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Carmel. Side paths along
the west side of Keystone Parkway, the north and south sides
of 99th Street, the north and south sides of 96th Street, and
extensions of existing side paths along Westfield Boulevard
to the north and south are critical pieces to add connectivity
100

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

to the region; and especially for recreation. Along 99th
Street, a sidewalk is preferred on the south side because it
has a narrower width and greater design flexibility to avoid
and preserve mature trees.
Side paths connecting the Chesterton Neighborhood to
Westfield Boulevard and Maple Drive from 99th to 96th
Streets will add important connections. Also, a side
path along the east side of Haverstick Road will enhance
pedestrian safety and provide another vital pedestrian link
north and south.
Mitigate Light Trespass and Glare: Strictly regulate on-site
lighting of any new development adjacent to stable neighborhoods to prevent light trespass and glare.
Preserve and Install Tree Canopy: The 96th Street and Westfield
Boulevard Subarea has a significant and well established
tree canopy. The character of this subarea is anchored by the
presence of many mature trees. Carmel will utilize its zoning regulations and processes to reasonably protect existing
tree canopy in the subarea. It will also require installation
of new canopy trees along public streets including Keystone
Parkway, when appropriate, to maintain the “green corridor”
aesthetic which exists in areas north along Keystone Parkway.
Soften Impacts from Major Corridors: As the 96th Street, Westfield Boulevard, and Keystone Parkway corridors evolve,
attention should be given to soften impacts to adjacent residential areas from future increases in traffic, widening of roads,
and new turning limitations at intersections. Specifically, future
roadway improvements should be context sensitive in their
design and improve the ability for residents and businesses to
gain access to the major corridors during peak hours.
Buffer Stable Neighborhoods from Redevelopment: Require permanent and effective buffering to be installed between stable
neighborhoods and areas that redevelop. Trees, landscaping,
decorative masonry walls (i.e. brick or stone, not wood), and
earthen berms should be considered, but the preservation
of residential dwellings within stable areas should also be a
factor.
Protect 99th Street and Haverstick Road as Residential-Character
Collector Streets: Assure that 99th Street and Haverstick Road
remain collector streets with residential character. Aside
from pedestrian facilities along Haverstick Road and 99th
Street, these streets generally remain the same.
Stabilize Hamilton Heights and Forest Glen Subdivisions: As
residential properties in close proximity to 96th Street redevelop, sever Kittrell Drive, Lincoln Boulevard, and Maple
Drive and terminate each in a cul-de-sac at the expense
of the commercial redevelopment. Also, link 98th Street
between Kittrell Drive and Lincoln Boulevard to allow
properties along Lincoln Boulevard and Maple Drive to have
access to Westfield Boulevard. This change would result in
the remaining homes being located on local streets and an
increased degree of neighborhood stability.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
Add Street Lights and Sidewalks: Because much of this
subarea was platted prior to subdivision regulations that
required proper infrastructure, many of the neighborhoods
do not have sufficient sidewalks, street lighting, or drainage facilities. The City of Carmel will utilize its existing
programs for public and private investment in such public
infrastructure.

Transition Area: The area designated as “Transition” on
the 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard Subarea Map,
on page 103, may be utilized for non-building features
associated with commercial redevelopment (e.g. storm water
management or parking), or may be used for medium to
high density single-family dwellings; either of which would
still necessitate buffering to minimize impacts to stable
neighborhoods as described herein.

Improve Surface Drainage: As new development has occurred
in the region, and as roads have been improved, local
residents believe issues with storm water have gotten worse.
The City should continue to study and help resolve these
drainage issues, thus helping to reduce basement flooding
and similar problems that can destabilize neighborhoods.

Growth Management: Redevelopment along 96th Street should
only be permitted when it is contiguous to existing commercial uses and when lots have been assembled into large
enough parcels for the commercial development to be master
planned with organized parking areas, linkages between
parking areas, effective buffers, landscaping and pedestrian
facilities.

Connect Maple Street to 99th Street: As a part of a recent
approval for a residential PUD, the developer committed to
extending Maple Street from 98th Street to 99th Street. This
link is considered important for emergency services to gain
access to residential structures from multiple directions.

Utilize Transitional Land Uses and Form to Soften Impacts of
Potentially Large-scale Office Development South of 96th Street: As
the area south of 96th Street evolves into office and commercial centers (Indianapolis’ jurisdiction), transitional uses and
smaller scale buildings should be used along the north side
of 96th Street to buffer stable neighborhoods to the north.
Similar to landscaping, moderate intensity land uses can
also be used for buffering. These buffering land uses would
be limited to one to two stories in height and would be
required to utilize facades and roof designs that are similar
to or complementary with residential development (e.g.
brick facades, pitched roofs, and dormers). Further, heavily
landscaped parking areas should be required.

Allow Employment Centers along 96th Street: Allow private
sector driven redevelopment (i.e. private negotiation and
willingness to sell) along the north side of the 96th Street
corridor between Keystone Parkway and Westfield Boulevard. Redevelopment projects should result in employment
centers (e.g. general office, medical office, or service business). Neighborhood serving commercial (e.g. small scale
dry cleaners, cafe, or convenience store) will be considered
if it fits the context. Generally, the footprint of new buildings associated with redevelopment should be limited to the
areas shown on the map and labeled “1 to 2 Story Employment Center” on page 103. See the conceptual cross section
drawings below.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
Reduce Curb Cuts along 96th Street: As areas along 96th Street
redevelop, require significant reduction in the number
of curb cuts. Also control where development south of
96th Street gains access to 96th Street. Street access from
the north and south should align with one another when
possible.
Maintain Westfield Boulevard as a Residential Corridor: Westfield
Boulevard between 96th Street and 99th Street will be
maintained as a residential corridor. The City of Carmel will
consider redevelopment along the east side of the corridor
when proposals are for high density single-family detached
dwellings or moderate density townhouses or apartments
that complement the area. Specifically, the cluster of properties on the southeast corner of 99th Street and Westfield
Boulevard and the properties between Kittrell and Westfield
Boulevard would be areas for redevelopment consideration.

Two-story office structures, like the one pictured above, would be
fitting along 96th Street between Haverstick Road and Westfield
Boulevard.

Design Guidelines

• Protect and enhance existing tree canopy.
• Establish safe means for bicyclists and pedestrians to
travel outside of and around the subarea, especially
to 116th Street, Central Park, Marion County, and
employment centers to the west.
• Protect existing residential neighborhoods from light
pollution by strictly requiring cut-off light fixtures and
other lighting standard.
• Evaluate the most effective and beneficial buffering
system to mitigate potential impacts to stable
neighborhoods on a case-by-case basis. Utilize buffering
systems that are aesthetically pleasing, comforting, and
natural in character. Also consider buffer designs that do
not consume large areas which necessitate the demolition
of additional residential structures.
• When redevelopment occurs, require small-scale office
buildings which complement the building mass of
residential properties. Require new office buildings to be
constructed in close proximity to the right of way with
parking areas predominantly in the side and rear yards.
• If neighborhood serving commercial development is
allowed, it should be designed carefully to fit the local
character and should have pedestrian connectivity to the
neighborhoods.

Parking should be primarily located in side yards or rear yards
and the buildings should be pulled forward toward the street. Also,
pedestrian facilities should be installed along the frontage.

High quality townhouses would be appropriate residential
redevelopment along Westfield Boulevard.

A limited amount of small-scale, neighborhood serving commercial
may be appropriate when supported by local residents.

LAND CLASSIFICATION PLAN
INTRODUCTION
Part 3: Land Classification Plan describes and establishes
different land classifications to be applied appropriately
across Carmel’s planning jurisdiction, similar to a future
land use plan. The term “land classification” is used instead
of “land use” because each classification integrates both
land use and development form. This hybrid approach for
classifying land will result in a better system for managing
land development.
The following land classifications are used on the Land
Classification Map:
1. Parks and Recreation....................................... pg 29
2. Estate Residential............................................. pg 30
3. Low Intensity Suburban Residential................. pg 31
4. Suburban Residential........................................ pg 32
5. Urban Residential............................................. pg 33
6. Attached Residential......................................... pg 34
7. Neighborhood Support Center.......................... pg 35
8. Neighborhood Service Node............................. pg 36
9. Institutional Node.............................................. pg 37

Land Classification Map

The Land Classification Map is described on page 44,
followed by the map on page 45.

Land Classifications and Descriptions

Each of the land classifications listed above have a page
dedicated to describing how it can be used to manage
growth and development. Further, the following headings
are used to convey the essence of each classification. These
descriptions are intended to be conceptual.
Purpose: This section gives the reader a brief description of
why the land use classification has been established.
Geographic Location: This section conveys where each
classification is best utilized within Carmel’s planning
jurisdiction. Some descriptions are vague because they
can be widely applied, while others are very specific to
geographic locations.
Land Uses: This section describes the general land uses
that would be permitted in the classification. The zoning
ordinance would indicate specific land uses permitted.
28

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Intensity/Density: This section describes the intended intensity
of commercial uses and density of residential uses that
would be fitting of the classification. The zoning ordinance
may utilize more than one zoning district to regulate each
classification.
Examples: This section strives to convey one or more
developments in Carmel that represent the classification. All
examples may not be exact matches, but represent the most
similar in intensity and density.
Appropriate Adjacent Classifications: This section describes
the land use classifications that are best used adjacent to
the subject classification. Three categories of compatibility
exist. “Best Fit” are classifications that are most suited for
adjacency. “Conditional Fit” indicates land classifications
that are suitable for adjacency if the building orientation,
transitions, and architecture are implemented with
sensitivity to the context. The third category are those land
classifications not listed, which represent classifications
that are not typically appropriate adjacent to the subject
classification.
Structure Features: This section identifies critical structural
features that help achieve the purpose of the classification.
Most statements are in regard to height, mass, or form of the
structure.
Structure Orientation On Site: This section addresses where
the footprint of the structure is located. Options typically
include centralized (setbacks on all four sides), zero lot-line
(front, rear, and one-side setback), build-to (specific front
setback), or no setbacks (the structure can cover the entire
site).
Development Features: This section denotes requirements of
subdivisions, planned unit developments, or development
plan projects. Typically, whole-development standards are
described.
Regulation Implementation: This section describes how the
City’s development regulations will implement the land use
classification’s intent.

PART 3: LAND CLASSIFICATION PLAN
PARKS AND RECREATION
Purpose

• To identify conservation areas, and to establish open space
areas for private and public parks and recreation.

Geographic Location

• Distributed throughout Carmel, especially in proximity to
high and medium density residential areas; and adjacent to
the Monon Greenway, White River, and other greenways.

Land Uses

• Parks, pocket parks, recreation, linear trails, greenways, golf
courses, natural areas, and the like.

The Plum Creek Golf Course is a good example of privately held
property that is classified as Parks and Recreation.

Intensity/Density

• Not applicable.

Examples

• West Park, Central Park, and Hazel Landing Park.
• Village of West Clay pocket parks.

Appropriate Adjacent Classifications

• Best Fit: Any land use classification.

Structure Features

• Sensitive to the natural environment or context.

Structure Orientation On Site
• Not applicable.

Development Features

• Protect existing (pre-development) environmental
features.
• Enhance the natural environment.
• Internal and external bicycle and pedestrian connectivity.
• Promote recreation, including passive enjoyment of nature.

West Park has areas dedicated to passive recreation. Its wonderful
natural features are blended with a playground, shelters, and other
park facilities.

Regulation Implementation

CLASSIFICATIONS TABLE

LAND CLASSIFICATION MAP DESCRIPTION
The Land Classification Map on the following page
designates the general distribution of land classifications
that will help manage land use, community form, and
connectivity; and improve quality of life.

The below table provides a quick reference for determining
land classification compatibility. The information in this
table mirrors the content in each of the land classification
descriptions on the previous pages. “B” stands for Best Fit
and “C” stands for Conditional Fit, meaning it is appropriate
when the more intense development is installed with
sensitivity to the adjacent land classification.

Specifically, the map depicts the community’s land
use and development form goals (land classifications)
in a conceptual manner. It should not be construed as
representing the precise location of land classifications, but
used as a foundation for support and influence with land use
and development form decisions and zoning map changes.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
INTRODUCTION
Part 2: Comprehensive Plan Essence establishes the City’s
planning policies and objectives categorized by geographic
area. Although there are many similarities in each district
there are also significant differences. This approach will
clearly communicate and guide the public and its leaders
in future decision making and share with the development
community the City’s policies and objectives. Further, the
public can base their expectations on the content of this Part.
Merriam-Webster defines essence as “the most significant
element, quality, or aspect of a thing or person.” For this
reason, the term “essence” was chosen for Part 2’s title to
convey the content within contained the core policies and
objectives for the City of Carmel.
To address each geographic area, this Part is divided into the
following five sections:

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
CITY-WIDE POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES
Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Introduction: The purpose of managing form is to achieve
a superior quality built and natural environment in which
people reside, work, and recreate. Managing community
form is the combination of land use planning, transportation planning, urban design, influencing transitions, and
place-making.
The tools used to manage community form take shape as
development guidelines, zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, studies, small area plans,
negotiations, commitments, conditions, covenants,
redevelopment initiatives, policies, education and the like.
No single tool can effectively manage community form.
Managing community form is a departure from purely
land use based regulations that encourage segregation and
challenge the community’s ability to establish essential
connectivity. This model is more permissive of mixed-use
nodes and requires greater sensitivity to transitions between
differing land classifications.
Objective 1.1: Merge form-based regulatory tools into the
traditional zoning and subdivision control ordinances based
on Part 3: Land Classification Plan.
Objective 1.2: Recognize the uniqueness in each planning
district and establish regulations, subarea plans, and/or pattern books to preserve these unique features.
Objective 1.3: Utilize and follow the intent of the C3 Plan
by applying the Plan’s content to development proposals to
leverage the desired outcomes and prevent deviations from
the City’s policies and objectives.
Objective 1.4: Be very sensitive to connectivity and transitions
between adjacent areas. Discourage unplanned or harsh
contrasts in height, building orientation, character, land use,
and density. If there exists contrast, utilize multiple design
principles to soften transitions.
Objective 1.5: Strongly promote mixed-use in areas suitable
for commercial development, and protect residential areas
from unsuitable commercial development.
Objective 1.6: Continue to build the city park and trail system
through targeted acquisition of remaining undeveloped
parcels.
Objective 1.7: Continue to manage commercial signage to
balance the visibility needs of business with the aesthetic
quality which has made Carmel an attractive place to live.

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

Introduction: The expression “Leading Edge City” is applied
to communities that have broad name recognition, notable
culture, a positive image, diversity in housing, broad range
of employment, business vitality, strong architectural presence and character, sense of place, environmental awareness,
effective public transportation, and most importantly a
desirable quality of life.
Objective 2.1: Commit to high architectural energy efficient
and environmental design standards for all municipal buildings and facilities. The intent is to set a precedent for quality
and to establish character goals for private sector development to emulate. Developers will take cues from municipal
improvements and be more likely to follow the City’s lead.
This commitment will also further the City’s competitive
advantage in the region, and increase community pride in the
built environment.
Objective 2.2: Further enhance the amenities, development
opportunities, office-supporting commerce and technology
infrastructure necessary to support current businesses and
to attract additional businesses to Carmel. Concurrently, it
is important to continue investing to enhance community
quality of life to provide a superior place for people in all
socioeconomic classes to live by encouraging high quality
public spaces, interesting parks, plazas, public gardens, treelined streets and boulevards, and trails connecting people
to places. There is significant evidence that high quality of
life is a major attraction for businesses, thus making this a
primary component of this objective.
Objective 2.3: Encourage more diversity in housing types
to better meet the needs of older residents and appeal to
younger and more diverse employees working in Carmel.
As Carmel continues to attract regional and national headquarters, the housing desired by people relocating from
other parts of the country and world is not always consistent
with Indiana’s traditional residential form of single-family
detached homes. The City needs to commission a study on
housing choices.
Objective 2.4: Support local intra-city and regional commuter
transit systems as described in Part 4: Transportation Plan.
Objective 2.5: Enhance a bicycle- and pedestrian-connected
community through expanded installation of side paths,
sidewalks, bike lanes, and off-street trails. It is well established that many of the moderate-sized leading edge cities in
our nation are bicycle and pedestrian friendly communities.
Carmel believes that the further establishment of bicycle
and pedestrian facilities will result in increased mobility,
further enhance quality of life, and be greatly appreciated by
citizens.
Objective 2.6: Recognize the existing limitations of east/west
vehicular, bike, and pedestrian access, and strive to enhance
means for efficient cross-community travel.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
Policy 3: Perpetuate Economic Vitality

Introduction: Vitality is defined in many ways, including
job growth, quantity of jobs, quality of jobs, proliferation
of commerce, entrepreneurship, investment in property,
redevelopment, length of commitment, and degree of risk
being taken. Carmel has strong economic vitality today, and
furthering that trend is of great interest and importance. This
section addresses the objectives that Carmel will utilize to
perpetuate economic vitality.
Objective 3.1: The City will strive to further the “Carmel”
brand as a great place to live, work and raise a family. The
City has already established a notable degree of branding;
branding being positive name recognition and impression.
Branding of a community is important when trying to attract
quality employers and businesses. For instance, wellrespected retail businesses want to be located in well-known
communities.
Objective 3.2: Encourage mixed-use developments where
appropriate. Single-use developments tend to lack vitality
during off-peak times. Mixed-use developments such as
Providence at Old Meridian often combine commercial and
residential uses into a single node. This type of development encourages daytime vitality from employment and
commerce activity, and nighttime vitality when people come
home from work. Also, this development pattern better
utilizes land by allowing compact urban form.
Objective 3.3: Encourage owners through zoning amendments
to retrofit existing single-use centers into mixed-use centers.
This encourages both daytime and nighttime vitality and
creates a compact urban form.
Objective 3.4: Utilize technology to efficiently communicate
City projects and initiatives to the public. Expand existing
lines of communication to reach more households and gain
more public input. Modernize the City’s website to accommodate this objective.
Objective 3.5: Clarify and streamline development procedures and processes. Simplify the development process
without lessening standards, expectations, or results. Create
incentives for development that exceeds expectations and
standards.
Objective 3.6: Plan for local and regional transit by encouraging transit opportunities in new developments where it
would benefit the community. The City should commission
a study to determine the best transit corridors for local transit
and how best to interface a regional system. Such a study
should also analyze how the City would form and benefit
from improved transit options.
Objective 3.7: Promote the advancement of technology to
support city-wide commerce, the workplace, and home
enterprise.

18

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Objective 3.8: Continue to improve overall telecommunication
in partnership with local providers to ensure that cable based
and wireless opportunities are maximized. The City should
commission a telecommunications master plan to ensure the
highest quality system network.
Objective 3.9: Promote Carmel City Center and the Regional
Performing Arts Center by marketing them as community
and regional destinations. Continue efforts to ensure that
properly scaled infrastructure is in place for vehicles,
bicycles, and pedestrians to easily access the Carmel City
Center area from all directions, including from U.S. 31 and
Keystone Parkway.
Objective 3.10: Continue to build upon the economic benefits
of the U.S. 31 Corridor by further maximizing its development potential. Encourage new buildings to be constructed
of high quality materials at the maximum building heights
allowed and encourage parking areas to be structured for the
most efficient use of land in the corridor.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
Policy 4: Be a City of Neighborhoods

Introduction: Neighborhoods are an essential component of
community which helps build and/or reinforce the fabric of
a city. Traditionally, neighborhoods were not recognized
by each individual development’s name as they are now.
Rather, neighborhoods were determined by major physical
boundaries; included a mix of housing styles; and were
within walking distance to neighborhood service centers,
schools, and parks which gave neighborhoods identity. This
document encourages planning for neighborhoods, in the
traditional sense, and also protects these neighborhoods.
Objective 4.1: Carmel is desirous of achieving the quality of
life benefits derived from the principles of traditional neighborhood design principals, in all neighborhoods including
those within the context appropriate to and respectful of each
location, whether estate, suburban, or urban.
Objective 4.2: The City believes it necessary to conduct
planning in greater detail in critical subareas and corridors.
For this reason Part 5: Critical Corridors and Subareas
was created to house those planning exercises within the
C3 Plan. These small area plans are important in communities with redevelopment pressures and in rapidly growing
areas. Oftentimes, critical corridor and subarea plans can
better address transitions, connectivity, and development
form. They can also address character goals and emphasize to
developers a more exact idea of what the resident wants, what
the market can yield, and what the City expects.
Objective 4.3: Establish neighborhood identity based on physical boundaries rather than by each development’s name.
Neighborhoods are more than each development project. A
concerted effort should be established to determine neighborhood boundaries throughout the City, and then promote
their identity and boundaries.
Objective 4.4: Build upon existing neighborhood facilities and
services, such as parks, schools, fire stations, and churches to
help define and maintain neighborhood identity and vitality.

Policy 5: Be an Adaptable City

Introduction: Being an adaptable city is critical in the evolution of a community. Too many communities do not adapt
to local, regional, and national influences and suffer from the
lack of flexibility.
Objective 5.1: Carmel will regularly reevaluate the local,
regional, and national influences that affect development
success and vitality. The City will also strive to predict the
next evolutions in development to better recognize whether
they would have a positive or negative effect on the City.
Objective 5.2: Periodically review and revise the Land
Classification Plan Map to adapt to changes in the built
environment, evolutions in community values, changes in
community policies, and to respond to critical corridor and
subarea plans.
Objective 5.3: Continue to recognize, plan, and update critical
corridors and subareas.
Objective 5.4: Enhance the Monon Greenway to support and
further encourage its use as a non-motorized commuter route
by widening and separating bicyclists and pedestrians in the
most heavily used areas. Also, actively plan and implement
a system of feeder/branch trails and paths to allow more
convenient and safe connection to nearby residential and
employment areas.
Objective 5.5: Adapt the Monon Greenway and adjacent
development between City Center and the Arts and Design
District into an urban trail destination with its own character
and sense of place.
Objective 5.6: Target for acquisition undeveloped parcels
adjacent to the Monon Greenway for future park sites.

Objective 4.5: Consider and encourage “third places” (informal meeting places or the social surroundings which are
separate from the two usual environments of home and
workplace) and neighborhood support centers as building
blocks for neighborhoods. Every trip to the store should
not be a mandatory drive in a car. Residents should be able
to access daily goods and services by walking or bicycling,
thereby having the opportunity to conserve energy, improve
health, and protect the environment. The City should
embark on a “corner store” initiative to define the best locations and distribution of neighborhood support centers.
Objective 4.6: Disallow incompatible site and building designs
and excessive quantity of neighborhood support centers.
Assure that neighborhood support centers provide amenities
and land uses that enhance quality of life and convenience,
and respect nearby residences with quality architecture, landscaping, and appropriate transitions. Also assure that they
are not a destabilizing feature by adopting design regulations and through implementation of a “radius policy” that
prohibits more than one center within proximity to another.

PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ESSENCE
Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Introduction: Community character is the quality(ies) and
feature(s) of a neighborhood, district, or the entire community that distinguish it from other areas. Community
character is desired and often helps build local pride, encourages investment, and improves quality of life.
Objective 6.1: Discourage homogeneous development and corporate brand prototypical architecture. In residential areas,
architectural guidelines should be instituted to discourage
monotonous development. Commercial and residential areas
should be subjected to architectural standards that require
unique and appropriate designs fitting Carmel’s character
goals.
Objective 6.2: Promote a unique community with unique
neighborhoods and subareas. Already the City’s infrastructure and planning investments are bearing fruit in the Old
Town Arts and Design District. The community will identify
appropriate character goals, subareas, and neighborhood
boundaries for the East, North Central, South Central, and
West Carmel Districts.
Objective 6.3: Encourage high quality and well designed
landscaping to help beautify the City and promote healthful
environments.
Objective 6.4: Promote the planting and care of canopy trees
throughout Carmel. Encourage their placement even in
urban streetscapes, parking lots, and other enclosed areas by
promoting proper soil volumes and/or the use of constructed
soil technologies. Canopy trees are desired because they add
a great deal of character and comfort to the built environment. Additionally, they also provide relief from heat, soften
noise and light, help purify the air we breathe, reduce stress,
and increase property values. This is a particularly important objective because so many mature trees are lost through
development.
Objective 6.5: Promote the use of public art in both public
spaces and within private developments. Also, encourage designers to include public art in their buildings and
surroundings.
Objective 6.6: Enable healthy choices through the use of
innovative design and planning. For instance, provide
pedestrian access to parks, recreation, schools, the workplace
and amenity centers so that people do not have to use their
cars. Also, designing structures to capture natural light and
air enhances healthy lifestyles.
Objective 6.7: Encourage electrical utility lines to be buried
throughout the community, especially in urbanizing areas.
Care must be given to the location of underground transformer boxes so pedestrian infrastructure is not precluded by
conflicts with power facilities.
Objective 6.8: Protect the character, safety, and function of the
Monon Greenway.
Objective 6.9: Enhance the aesthetics of employment and
vitality districts by requiring parking lots to be located at
the rear and side of the property, or underground, thereby
encouraging the architecture to be the dominant feature.

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Policy 7: Inspire Environmental Awareness

Introduction: Being environmentally aware includes understanding the benefits of protecting natural areas, emphasizing
use of native plant material into the urban environment,
reducing energy consumption, encouraging energy and
natural resource conservation, and utilizing “green” building
materials to lessen our impact on the environment.
Objective 7.1: Encourage the use of durable materials and
construction methods that prolong the life of buildings. A
paradigm shift is necessary to change the current 30-year life
expectancy of commercial buildings and some production
homes to a more substantial life expectancy. Carmel has
already had some success in encouraging 100-year buildings. For instance, that standard is currently being applied to
several buildings in the City Center and the Old Town Arts
and Design District.
Objective 7.2: Continue the policy emphasizing that City
vehicles be energy efficient and low emission cars and
trucks. With the introduction of hybrid vehicles, the City
now has a viable and visible means for improving the environment through energy conservation. Also, idling should
be discouraged when possible.
Objective 7.3: Develop a bicycle network to allow nonvehicular trips to be made by encouraging small-scale and
requiring large-scale employment nodes to install covered
and secure bicycle parking, and shower and changing
facilities for cycling commuters. Concurrently, ensure that
adequate bicycling facilities exist to allow safe and efficient
bicycle commuting.
Objective 7.4: The City should encourage use of water-saving
devices, and request that citizens reduce water consumption by proper (“smart”) lawn sprinkling and exploring
alternative landscapes which require less water. Encourage
rainwater (i.e. grey water) recycling to reduce potable water
consumption.
Objective 7.5: Strongly encourage developers to build
environmentally sensitive buildings, such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) guidelines or
similar programs. These “green” buildings conserve energy
resources, provide more healthful inside environments, last
longer, utilize products made from recycled material, and
use products that can be safely disposed of or recycled when
the building is eventually dismantled. Green buildings
also strive to use local material to reduce the transportation
impact. For instance, importing marble from overseas has
an enormous environmental impact compared to delivering
Indiana limestone from southern counties.
Objective 7.6: Set the precedent for environmental protection
or re-vegetation when developing municipal facilities like
parks, fire stations, and maintenance facilities.

PART 2: Comprehensive Plan Essence
Objective 7.7: Continue to protect regional surface and
ground water sources to ensure safe drinking water for
Carmel and adjacent municipalities.  Institute regulations
that further protect the delineated wellhead protection areas
from contaminants and land uses that have a higher risk of
contaminating water resources.
Objective 7.8:  Set the precedent for environmentally sensitive
buildings when developing municipal facilities by striving
for the highest feasible level of LEED certification.  Also
encourage other public entities to achieve the same.
Objective 7.9:  Develop and maintain an Environmental Action
Plan to implement actions that reduce pollution, conserve
energy, and preserve the natural environment.
Objective 7.10:  Explore the use of alternate sources of energy
such as active solar, geothermal, and wind.
Objective 7.11:  Reduce heat island effect by preservation of
Carmel’s urban forest and by encouraging the use surfaces
that retard the absorption of heat.
Objective 7.12:  Increase effectiveness of wastewater treatment
and discharge by combining master plans of both sanitary
sewer districts.
Objective 7.13:  Reduce unnecessary removal of trees on lots,
encourage preservation of mature trees, and require replacement of trees that have to be removed for development.
Objective 7.14:  Promote the movement toward sustainable
development and architecture.  Encourage land developments and building designs that use or reuse land responsibly by discouraging patterns of sprawl, conserving potable
water, reducing energy consumption, and utilizing reusable
or recyclable materials.  Encourage architects and designers
to use green design standards, such as LEED (Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design), to promote sustainable
and healthful buildings and neighborhoods for people to
shop, work, eat, recreate, and live.

Policy 8: Inspire Healthful Living

Introduction: Inspiring healthful living is a response to the
obesity rate in Indiana and the Midwest, and also recognizes
increases in cancer rates, lung diseases, heart disease, and
stress related disorders.  
Objective 8.1: Strive to provide multiple types of facilities for
exercise, opportunities to immerse oneself into nature, sport
facilities and leagues, access to recreation programs, access
to health education programs, and encouragement to succeed
in one’s personal health goals.
Objective 8.2:  Work corroboratively with local hospitals to
offer outreach services, health and wellness clinics, screenings, classes, smoking cessation programs, dietary support,
mental health clinics, immunization programs, and the like.
Objective 8.3:  Encourage mixed-use, compact development
making it easier for people to walk or ride their bicycles.  
This will provide a healthy lifestyle by providing the option
for exercise in people’s daily routines.
Objective 8.4:  Develop programs and improve infrastructure
to encourage children to walk or ride their bicycles to
school.  This will increase their physical activity, improve
their health, and will potentially reduce the automobile trips
made to and from school.
Objective 8.5:  Promptly work to obtain park land while
undeveloped land is still available.   

Objective 7.15:  Due to increasing interest in redeveloping
previously-developed areas, the City would like to conduct
inventories, analyses, and cleanups of its brownfields.  This
will serve to facilitate redevelopment in several areas, as
well as making the City healthier and more sustainable.  The
City will also be working with citizens and professionals to
identify and prioritize brownfields.

EAST CARMEL POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Introduction

Objective 6.1: Reinforce suburban character including treelined curvilinear streets, sidewalks separated by tree lawns,
and neighborhood parks. Also, maintain the dominant
presence of high quality single-family residential form.

Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Objective 6.2: Allow density transitions from single-family
residential form along East 96th Street and 146th Street , but
encourage context sensitive buffer development along these
corridors to help soften the visual impact to lower density
residential neighborhoods.

The following sections convey the policies and objectives
for the East Carmel District. It is important to note that
these sections share some of the same policy headings as the
City-Wide section, but the content is specific to East Carmel.
Objective 1.1: Protect the integrity of the suburban form and
land uses. East Carmel is an area where redevelopment
of residential districts is discouraged, and where investment in single-family homes is strongly encouraged. The
City will identify projects, policies, and programs that will
maintain the existing stability and encourage investment by
homeowners.
Objective 1.2: Allow neighborhood service nodes in context
appropriate areas. The objective of these nodes is to allow
limited neighborhood-serving commercial, mixed-use, and
public amenities within walking distance to residents living
in surrounding suburban neighborhoods. Lighting, parking,
architecture, landscaping, size of buildings, and bicycle and
pedestrian facilities will be strictly regulated to help ensure
the nodes blend in with existing residential uses.

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

Objective 2.1: Embrace the White River Greenway and
off-street trail to provide another notable linear park and
non-motorized transportation corridor which connects parks
as well as acting as the foundation for a larger, regional
greenway. More off-street trails are expected to contribute
to the overall network of paths, especially in the natural
corridor of the White River.
Objective 2.2: Promote a high quality mixed-use neighborhood
development on the Legacy property, achieving the same
recognition as the Village of WestClay. Unique uses or a
combination of uses should be designed into the context
of the natural environment and surrounding suburban
development.

Objective 7.1: Aggressively protect the riparian corridor and
floodplain along the White River from encroachment.
Objective 7.2: Continually monitor mining practices to ensure
balance between the legitimate needs of the resident and
regional need for local materials. Also, encourage reclamation planning for quarry sites to better coordinate public
facilities and infrastructure improvements, and public
recreation or residential opportunities.
Objective 7.3: Expand East Carmel bicycle and pedestrian
infrastructure, especially in areas adjacent to institutional
nodes such as schools and churches, and neighborhoodserving commercial.
Objective 7.4: Establish an East Carmel recycling and hazardous materials drop-off station in conjunction with the City’s
sewage treatment facility.
Objective 7.5: Locate an East Carmel satellite facility for Carmel Street Maintenance and other public services. This will
help conserve fuel and distribute manpower more equally
over the community.

NORTH CENTRAL CARMEL POLICIES AND
OBJECTIVES

Objective 2.4: Promote the Arts and Design District and the
Carmel Performing Arts Center.

Introduction

Objective 2.6: Explore opportunities to introduce additional
higher education opportunities into North Central Carmel, if
only a single building or satellite classes.

The following sections convey the policies and objectives
for the North Central Carmel District. It is important to note
that these sections share some of the same policy headings
as the City-Wide section, but the content is specific to North
Central Carmel.

Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Objective 1.1: Encourage compact urban form and mixed-use
development throughout North Central Carmel.
Objective 1.2: Allow the tallest structures in Carmel to be in
the City Center and along U.S. 31.
Objective 1.3: Strongly encourage neighborhood and communityserving commercial nodes in strategic locations to allow people
to walk or bike from their jobs and homes to those amenities.
The objective is to ensure the entire North Central Carmel
District has neighborhood-serving or community-serving commercial development within a short walking or biking distance
of all employment and residential development.
Objective 1.4: Protect stable single-family residential neighborhoods in North Central Carmel as much as possible
through buffering, use of transitional design, strong code
enforcement of property maintenance issues, targeted infrastructure investments (e.g. drainage, sidewalks, and street
lights), and landscaping beautification projects.
Objective 1.5: Strive for additional street connectivity in North
Central Carmel. The City should strive to connect streets
when new development or redevelopment occurs, especially
those linkages shown on the Thoroughfare Plan Map.
Objective 1.6: Encourage connectivity to and through North
Central Carmel by establishing bicycle and pedestrian facilities across Meridian Street and Keystone Parkway.

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

Objective 2.5: Plan for the integration of transit stops near City
Center, Merchants Square, and the U.S. 31 Corridor.

Objective 2.7: Promote and enhance the Monon Greenway as
a non-motorized transportation corridor. Widen the trail in
high use areas to accommodate separated bicycle and pedestrian lanes to create more trail capacity for both recreation
and transportation needs.

Policy 3: Perpetuate Economic Vitality

(no additional objectives apply to North Central Carmel)

Policy 4: Be a City of Neighborhoods

Objective 4.1: North Central Carmel should be planned as a
collection of neighborhoods applying traditional neighborhood design principles to connectivity, transitions, location of neighborhood-serving commercial, bicycle- and
pedestrian-friendly features, and the like.
Objective 4.2: Endeavor to plan neighborhoods, gateways, boundaries, and service areas through more detailed subarea plans.

Policy 5: Be an Adaptable City

(no additional objectives apply to North Central Carmel)

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Objective 6.1: Where appropriate, reinforce urban character in
North Central Carmel. Commission the study of the district to
determine the ideal boundaries, urban patterns, and transitions.
Objective 6.2: Encourage signature buildings on prominent
sites to enhance the district’s character. Signature buildings
can be private or public buildings, but must have architectural flair and be built from durable materials.
Objective 6.3: Establish a Public Art Master Plan. Include
artists in the design process of public spaces.

Policy 7: Inspire Environmental Awareness

Objective 2.1: Establish a well-designed, pedestrian-friendly
(including bicycle-friendly) and vital downtown. To ensure
vitality, significant incorporation of residential and office
uses should be required in upper floors. All ground floors
should be designed for pedestrian comfort and interaction.

Objective 7.1: Where possible, locate new public parks on land
adjacent to or within a short walk from the Monon Greenway.

Objective 2.2: Promote a high quality employment corridor
and technology park along U.S. 31 by discretely integrating
employment-serving commercial uses in existing buildings
or in small nodes to allow workers to walk to restaurants and
other businesses suitable for such a subdistrict. Also allow
for a broader mix of uses, including additional residential
and service retail.

Objective 7.3: Promote compact urban form with densities that
support walkability and alternative transportation.

Objective 2.3: Encourage new buildings along Carmel Drive and
City Center Drive to be a minimum of two stories in height.

Objective 7.2: Tree areas should be conserved and should be
evaluated as part of an overall urban forest network, especially in small parks and squares.

Objective 7.4: Continue to enhance the City Recycling Facilities at the Housing Hazardous Waste Center by increasing
recycling options and adjusting hours of operation to make it
more convenient for people to recycle.

WEST CARMEL POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES

Objective 1.7: Continue expansion of bicycle and pedestrian
infrastructure to connect neighborhoods with schools, parks,
WestClay’s Secondary Core, and other destinations.

Introduction

Policy 2: Be a Leading Edge City

The following sections convey the policies and objectives
for West Carmel. It is important to note that these sections
share some of the same policy headings as the City-wide
section, but the content under each heading is specific to
West Carmel and adds to other City-wide objectives.

Policy 1: Manage Community Form

Objective 1.1: Preserve the estate character of West Carmel
by protecting large-lot residential areas and by requiring
new subdivisions to have large setbacks from and quality
landscaping along perimeter roads. Further, require extensive re-vegetation along perimeter roads and within each
new development. A larger open space requirement should
also be considered.
Objective 1.2: Conservation subdivisions and innovative
residential community designs that protect vegetation, slopes
and are non-monotonous in terms of architecture and material
selection are preferred.
Objective 1.3: Subdivision connectivity and transitions
between proposed developments and existing subdivisions
should be scrutinized to a greater degree in West Carmel.

Objective 2.1: Maintain and protect sub-areas in the City
of Carmel for estate character housing. These areas are
essential to attracting high quality businesses, providing the
desired quality-of-life for senior employees.
Objective 2.2: Encourage more custom home developments
to balance the housing inventory which has been slanting in
recent years toward production homes. Custom home neighborhoods will also add character to West Carmel by reducing
monotony. Concurrently, allow carriage houses and other
compatible forms of accessory dwellings to provide flexibility and a range of housing options.
Objective 2.3: Adopt residential architecture standards to
ensure compatibility, a high quality aesthetic, energy
efficiency, and durability.

Policy 3: Perpetuate Economic Vitality

(no additional objectives apply to West Carmel)

Policy 4: Be a City of Neighborhoods

(no additional objectives apply to West Carmel)

Policy 5: Be an Adaptable City

Objective 1.4: West Carmel has many non-connecting subdivisions. The proliferation of this pattern of development is
more tolerable in this district; however, critical connections
shown on the Thoroughfare Plan will be absolutely required.
Although there is less emphasis on vehicular connectivity,
bicycle and pedestrian connectivity will be strictly required.
For instance, where road connectivity between a proposed
development and an existing development is not required,
bicycle and pedestrian connections will be required.

(no additional objectives apply to West Carmel)

Objective 1.5: With the success of the Monon Greenway,
other off-street facilities are in demand. West Carmel has an
opportunity to utilize portions of several pipeline corridors
for such a trail. These corridors are shown as off-street trails
in the 2020 Vision Plan and in the Alternative Transportation Plan initially adopted in 2001, and are supported in the
C3 Plan as well. Integrating this type of facility in some
areas will be relatively easy, but in already built environments may prove to be more difficult.

Objective 6.3: Require commercial buildings along Michigan
Road to be constructed of durable materials and designed to
reflect “village” character. Continue to strengthen the existing zoning ordinance overlay to implement the requirements.

Objective 1.6: Carmel should partner with neighboring
Westfield and Zionsville to plan and implement a significant
greenway along Little Eagle Creek.

Policy 6: Inspire Community Character

Objective 6.1: Reinforce rural character including tree lines,
fence rows, barns, pockets of open space, and preservation
of wood lots. Residential intensity can exist, but generally
should not be obviously portrayed from perimeter roads.
Objective 6.2: Protect single-family residential character along West
96th Street between Spring Mill Road and Shelbourne Road.

Objective 6.4: Require large setbacks and lot sizes, and only
residential, institutional, and park uses along 116th Street
from Spring Mill Road west to the Boone County Line.
Utilize the existing zoning ordinance overlay to implement.

Policy 7: Inspire Environmental Awareness

Objective 7.1: Strive to protect woodlots, wetlands, and other
valuable natural features in West Carmel. These features
contribute to the district’s rural character, but they also
provide habitat for plants, birds, and other animals.

Policy 8: Inspire Healthful Living

Objective 8.1: Promptly work to obtain park land in the north
western portion of Clay Township while undeveloped land is
still available.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

X. TRANSPORTATION
The City of Richmond intends to have a well integrated transportation system composed of

context sensitive road networks, mass transit and hike/bike trails to allow local residents and
visitors to access employment, shopping, recreation, entertainment, and other destinations
quickly and efficiently with minimal adverse impacts to the environment or neighborhoods.
The City of Richmond intends to evaluate the effectiveness of its transportation system with
the health and safety of its citizens and visitors and sustainability standards as its primary
concerns.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA |

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

X. TRANSPORTATION
A. Introduction
Transportation systems facilitate all motorized and non-motorized movement through a
community. A transportation system determines the interconnectivity that is necessary within a
community, and it includes all of those elements that contribute to its pedestrian and vehicular
circulation. This chapter provides information about this community’s transportation system
and network decisions, so that Richmond’s city officials will be better prepared for the critical
issues in the future. The recommendations made in this chapter are for using as the foundations
of a long-range transportation plan that will help guide Richmond’s transportation investments.
The transportation plan is to meet State and regional planning requirements while addressing
local transportation needs for cost-effective street, transit, freight, bicycle, and pedestrian
improvements. The goals, objectives, and recommendations identified in this chapter provide
transportation choices for residents, employees, visitors, and firms doing business in Richmond.
The ideas presented will suggest opportunities that can make it more convenient to walk,
bicycle, and take transit in order to be a less auto-dependent community. Ultimately, the
transportation plan created from this document will provide a balanced transportation system
that supports neighborhood and countywide connectivity, plus promote economic development,
while not detracting from the welfare of the community.
It is important to understand Richmond’s transportation system and its integral relationship to
land use throughout the city. A basic element of this relationship is the functional classification
of the roadway system. An analysis of Richmond’s transportation system provides insight into
what types of transportation improvements will best meet the needs of Richmond’s residents.
This analysis includes reviewing Richmond’s existing transportation network, vehicular
accidents, and traffic counts. An examination of the existing traffic counts, accident incidents,
planned improvements, and current level of public transportation provided the existing
conditions for this area. The recommendations that are made for improving the community’s
transportation system take into consideration all of the information received from proposals
regarding the addition or management of existing signals and signage, plus intersection and
roadway improvements. Additionally, the expansion of an interconnected bicycle and pathway
system, with connectors into the bike paths of adjoining cities in the region is an important part
of a successful transportation system for this community. Recommendations are listed at the end
of this chapter.
Richmond is located just south of Interstate 70 (I-70), and along major regional highways. These
corridors provide regional and cross-country access to Indianapolis, Dayton, and points beyond.
The area’s proximity to I-70 and regional highways provides employment opportunities to
residents and market opportunities for local businesses. At the same time, residents feel
vulnerable to negative impact of traffic congestion on local streets, primarily during peak traffic
periods. Part of local traffic problems stems from the city’s location and reliance on the car to get
around. City residents would like to minimize the impact of through traffic and create a sense of
identity at primary entranceways into the city. There is also a need to increase regional and local
transportation alternatives to the car. Strong support is voiced for a system of sidewalks, bike
paths, and trails that provided residents with safe and enjoyable access to services, school
campus areas, parks, and downtown area.

B. Goal and Objectives
Goal

Provide for existing and future transportation needs of the City through implementation of
transportation improvements that facilitate local motorized and non-motorized movement,
minimize the impact of regional traffic through the city, and facilitate local business access.

Objectives
1.

System-wide
• The city will develop a balanced transportation system including a completed
motorized and non-motorized network.
• The network of public rights-of-way and easements that create travel corridors
are the primary infrastructure for all modes and will be managed and expanded
in a manner that preserves or improves the capacity and efficiency of all modes.

2. Safety
• Improve safety at locations where safety is deficient, striving to design solutions
that are most consistent with Richmond's city character.
• Provide and design for pedestrian safety, in the form of well-defined crosswalks
and safe, identifiable access to trails and pathways.
• Develop traffic calming measures to reduce speeding and discourage through
traffic on local streets.
3. Investment and Coordination
• Provide and implement a street maintenance program that prioritizes roadway
improvements and coordinates them with economic development initiatives.
• Identify local, state, and federal funding options to implement roadway
improvements that are acceptable to the City.
• Coordinate with neighboring communities to promote an effective and efficient
local and regional transportation system.
• Coordinate with private businesses and quasi-public agencies to develop
potential roadway improvements.
• Utilize traffic volumes along U.S. 40 and U.S. 27 as an opportunity to attract
businesses.
• Coordinate development with roadway improvements.
4. Integrated Design
• Design all transportation facilities to contribute to a positive and attractive
visual image and the desired community character.
• Include streetscape designs that improve the physical appearance of roadways
within the city.
• Develop access management standards to manage traffic flow along corridors.
• Enhance primary entryways to the community.
• Develop and implement design standards that require new development to
provide sidewalks and/or pedestrian and bicycle paths.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 194

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

5. Transportation Impact
• Accommodate regional traffic by providing transportation options that direct
pass-through traffic away from the city’s internal roadway network and onto
regional transportation corridors.
• Discourage pass-through traffic patterns in residential areas.
• Minimize the intrusion of through traffic on Richmond's collector and local
streets.
• Direct trucks to designated routes through the city.
6. Multimodal Strategies
• Create an interconnected street system that facilitates safe travel throughout the
city for pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles.
• Promote the greater use of alternatives to single-occupancy automobile travel
with the objective of limiting the extent and duration of congestion.
7. Congestion Management
• The city will increase the efficiency of travel, promote innovative strategies, and
implement travel demand strategies to limit the increase of congestion.

C. Transportation System
An analysis of Richmond’s transportation system provides insight into the types of
transportation improvements that will improve the quality of life for residents of Richmond.
This analysis includes a review of Richmond’s existing transportation network, vehicular
accidents, and traffic counts. An examination of the existing traffic counts, accident incidents,
planned improvements, and current level of public transportation provides the existing
conditions for this area. The recommendations for improvements to Richmond’s transportation
system take into consideration all of the information from proposals regarding the addition or
management of existing signals and signage, intersection improvements, and roadway
improvements. Additionally, an interconnected bicycle and pathway system, with connectors
into the bike paths of adjoining cities in the region is an important factor for improving this
community’s transportation system. Recommendations are listed at the end of this chapter.
It is especially important to understand the transportation system and its integral relationship to
land use throughout the city. A basic element of this relationship is the functional classification
of the roadway system.

D. Existing Network
Interstate 70 (I-70) is the most important roadway to the City and the region, running east-west
on the west and north sides of the city limits. The I-70 Corridor has emerged as a key location for
new homes and many industries. The western part of the city region attracts more distribution
and manufacturing firms, while the northern section consists of technological companies and
higher education facilities.
Highway 27 runs north-south through the city. This full-access roadway provides the area with a
direct link to Fort Wayne, Oxford, Ohio, and Cincinnati. Highway 40 connects Richmond to all
the region’s major urban communities to the west including Centerville, East Germantown, and
Cambridge City. Urban areas in Ohio can also be accessed via Highway 40 to the east of
Richmond.

E. Street Functional Classification
Streets definition is based on a functional classification, using factors such as capacity, length,
spacing from other streets and the types of traffic served (shorter versus longer distance and the
percentage of trucks, for example). In theory, major streets designed to move traffic are classified
as arterial or collector streets, while streets designed to provide access to adjacent land uses with
little or no through traffic are classified as local streets. In reality, many roadways may serve both
functions in varying degrees. The Transportation Corridors Map illustrates the intended
function of the street system.
Functional classification categories are summarized below. A list of streets by classification is
provided in Table; Roadway Classifications. All of the city’s streets are considered “urban”
within the metropolitan area by the state and federal road agencies for purposes of planning and
funding.
•

Interstates/Expressways. The highest category, interstates/expressways serve most of
the longer distance travel to and through the area and thus are designed to carry the
highest traffic volumes. The designated interstate/expressway in the city is I-70 that is
under the jurisdiction of the Indiana Department of Transportation.

•

Major Arterials. (also referred to as Principal Arterials) This is the highest class of
streets under the city’s jurisdiction. Arterials often have links to the expressways
through interchanges and thus move large volumes of traffic through the city or to and
from major destinations within the city.

•

Minor Arterials. This functional class serves trips of moderate length and moderate
volumes, usually with a lower design speed than the major arterials. Minor arterials are
intended to provide links to and between the major arterials, but have more emphasis on
access to adjacent land uses. Ideally, these streets should not penetrate identifiable
neighborhoods.

•

Collector Streets. These streets serve as a link between local streets and arterial streets.
Collector streets provide both access and traffic circulation within residential,
commercial, and industrial areas. Moderate to low traffic volumes are typical, but they
may have slightly wider pavement or design speeds than the local streets.

•

Local Streets. Local streets make up the highest percentage of streets in the city. The
primary purpose is to move traffic from adjacent land uses to the arterials, sometimes via
a collector street. Design speed is typically low, as are volumes. Through-traffic on these
streets is deliberately discouraged.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

Interstate 70 extends east-west on the north side of the city, and provides access to cities such as
Dayton to the east and Indianapolis to the west. This interstate forms the north border of the
city. Its location has attracted industrial land uses that have quick access to an express route.
Within Richmond, interchanges with I-70 are provided at U.S. 40, U.S. 27, U.S. 35, and S.R. 227.
Mostly vacant land exists along the corridor, but is expected to develop especially with the new
hospital campus and interchange development opportunities. U.S. 27 provides a north-south
route and intersects the city. A mixture of land uses including commercial, service, and light
industrial is located adjacent to the corridor. U.S. 40 provides an east-west route and also
intersects the city. The location of these two roadways creates a separation of areas within the
city but provides both a through route and local access to area businesses, city facilities and
neighborhoods.
The Federal Highway Administration defines level of service as a qualitative assessment of a
road's operating conditions. It is dependent on peak-hour traffic volumes, traffic composition
(vehicle size), vehicle speeds, the number of travel lanes, traffic signals, and on-street parking.
The level of service classifications for primary roadways in Richmond are provided on maps at
the end of this chapter.

Freeway
I-70/U.S. 35 borders the city to the north and east, and provides access to the city via the
Highway 35/Willamsburg Pike, Highway 27/Chester Boulevard, S.R. 227/Middleboro Pike, and
Highway 40 interchanges. The interstate is an important element of the overall transportation
network within the city, and brings local, regional, and national travelers to the area. In 2002,
two-way traffic along I-70 between the Highway 35/Willamsburg Pike interchange and Highway
40 interchange averaged 34,992 vehicles per day, a decrease of 3,648 vehicles per day (38,640
vehicles) in 1998. Signage, landscaping and associated corridor improvements will help to
provide an identity to the area and attract travelers. Diverse and distinct uses around the
interchanges will assist in establishing Richmond as a destination-base instead of a pass-through
area.

Arterial Streets
Highway 40/National Road (West and East) is a principal arterial roadway that extends eastwest through the city. It contains four lanes through the city and is divided by a landscaped
median from approximately Garwood Road/Hayes Arboretum Road to the I-70 interchange.
Highway 40 provides direct access to I-70 and continues into the state of Ohio. It also provides
direct access west to Centerville.
In 2003, two-way traffic along M-40 west of Whitewater River averaged 18,685 vehicles per day,
an increase of 1,318 vehicles (17,367 vehicles) from 1995. East of downtown, two-way traffic
averaged 15,021 vehicles per day, a decrease of 4,084 vehicles from 1995. The heaviest traffic
occurred during peak travel periods, or from 6:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m. Both of
these roadway segments are currently operating at acceptable levels of service for daily traffic
volume. However, as traffic continues to grow additional roadway improvements may be
warranted. As a general rule, as 24 hour traffic volumes approach 15,000+ and 30,000+ vehicles
per day for the two lane and four lane portions, roadway design should be evaluated.

Highway 27/Chester Blvd is a principal arterial that runs north-south through the city. It
contains four lanes through the city, but is divided into 8th and 9th Street from C Street to south
of L Street. Highway 27 provides through routes to Fort Wayne to the north and Cincinnati to
the south. In 2003, two-way traffic along Highway 27 between I-70 and Highway 40 averaged
14,744 vehicles per day, an increase in 364 vehicles from 1995. Between Highway 40 and the
south city limit, two-way traffic averaged 6,380 vehicles per day, a decrease of 1,960 vehicles from
1995. Both of these roadway segments are currently operating at acceptable levels of service for
daily traffic volume, but additional roadway improvements may be warranted with the opening
of the new hospital and medical campus near Highway 27 and Industries Road and residential
growth on the southern portion of the city.
Industries Road is a minor arterial roadway that
serves east-west traffic movement on the north
side of the city. The road is a major route for
vehicles that access industrial properties, the Hill’s
Pet Products facility, Carpenter Manufacturing,
and Midwest Industrial Park from Highway 27 and
Williamsburg Pike. The roadway’s location and
parallel alignment with I-70 is ideal to serve these
uses without requiring motorists to travel on I-70.
Industries Road currently operates at acceptable
levels of service for daily traffic volume, but
additional roadway improvements may be
warranted as land develops along the roadway and Source: LSL

Salisbury Road serves as a minor arterial road that provides a north-south route on the west side
of the city. The road connects to Highway 35 north of the city and continues south through the
city limits. Access is provided to the Midwest Industrial Park and intersects with Highway 40.
Improvements are planned from NW L Street to Highway 40. Salisbury Road currently operates
at acceptable levels of service for daily traffic volume.

Middleboro Pike (the northern part of S.R. 227)
is a minor arterial roadway that provides regional
travel from near the downtown area (12th Street)
to areas northeast of the city. Access is provided
to I-70, and the road runs along the middle fork
of the Whitewater River and Middlefork
Reservoir into the downtown area. In 2003, twoway traffic along Middleboro Pike (S.R. 227)
between I-70 and the U.S. 27 junction area near
North 1st Street averaged 2,805 vehicles per day.
The road currently operates at acceptable levels

New Paris Pike (S.R. 121) provides regional access to Richmond from Ohio. The minor arterial
roadway runs parallel to the east fork of the Whitewater River. Since the road does not access I70, New Paris Pike is designed to provide local and regional traffic access to Richmond and eastcentral Ohio. In 2003, I-70 averaged 5,028 vehicles per day. The road currently operates at
acceptable levels of service for daily traffic volume.
Boston Pike (the southern part of S.R. 227) provides regional access to the airport and
destinations south and east of Richmond. Although only a small portion of the roadway is
located within the city limits, Boston Pike serves as an important roadway to the city and
regional area as the main route to the regional airport. The roadway intersects with Highway 27
on the south side of the city, and provides access to Richmond Power and Light and the nearby
Elks Country Club. In 2003, two-way traffic along Boston Pike averaged 2,030 vehicles per day
from the intersection of U.S. 27 and Union County Line (near the Richmond airport). The road
currently operates at acceptable levels of service for daily traffic volume, but volume should be
monitored if air service increases at the airport.

Williamsburg Pike serves as a key regional travel
route on the northwest side of the city. The
roadway is identified as Highway 35 north of the
city limits and changes to Williamsburg Pike
south of the I-70 interchange, where full access is
provided. The road provides service to industrial
properties, and terminates at NW 5th Street at the
fire station.

Union Pike provides north-south regional access to the city, and changes to NW 5th Street south
of Progress Drive/Sheridan Street. Although the roadway does not provide access to I-70, it does
function as an important roadway to serve industrial properties located between Highway 27
and Salisbury Road on the north side of the city. Union Pike road currently operates at
acceptable levels of service for daily traffic volume, but additional roadway improvements may be
warranted as land develops along the roadway.

F. Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
The table below lists the average daily traffic volumes for count stations located around
Richmond. A traffic count of average daily traffic (ADT) is taken on a road over a 24-hour period
counting in both directions. The magnitude of traffic is used to measure how near maximum
capacity the present road is and over time determine the rate at which traffic is growing. A
general ideal capacity for a two-lane road is about 15,000-16,000 ADT. For those counts where
traffic is counted separately in each direction, the two need to be added to obtain ADT.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

Based on these figures, a decrease in traffic has occurred in the south and east portions of the city,
and along I-70 between the Highway 35/Williamsburg Pike interchange and Highway 40
interchange. Traffic volumes have increased north of National Road (Highway 40) and west of
U.S. 27. It is anticipated that traffic volumes will continue to increase north of National Road,
specifically near the I-70 interchange, with the addition of the new hospital and medical campus
and additional industrial developments. Such developments will cause a need to focus on access
management, truck routing, and traffic flow measures along U.S. 27, Industries Road, and
Salisbury Road. It is projected that traffic levels will increase south of National Road and east of
Whitewater River as new housing developments are built within the southeast portion of the
city; additional industrial parcels are developed near Industrial Parkway and Hodgin Road, and
air service increases occur at the Richmond Airport.

Accidents

Traffic accidents, simply termed “crashes” by traffic engineering professionals, are one factor used
to identify problems in the street system that may require correction: The number of crashes is
compared to the number of vehicles traveling along a segment or through an intersection to
determine the crash rate. High crash rates compared to similar locations may indicate the need
for improvements, especially where there is a trend for a particular type of correctable crash. For
the period from January 1, 2005 to March 31, 2005, there were 485 traffic accidents reported in
Richmond. The top accident intersections within the city during this period were:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

3 on South 16th Street and A Street
3 on North 5th Street and Richmond Avenue
2 on Chester Boulevard and Sim Hodgin
2 on North 8th Street and A Street
2 on South 15th Street and B Street
2 on South 9th Street and E Street
2 on South West 3rd Street and National Road West (Hwy 40)
2 on College Avenue and National Road West (Hwy 40)
2 on South West 5th Street and National Road West (Hwy 40)
2 on Garwood and National Road East (Hwy 40)

Other accidents were dispersed throughout the city. This data indicates that improvements in
terms of access management, traffic signaling, and/or turning movements may need to be
considered in order to improve safety along Highway 40. The development and redevelopment of
parcels along this roadway should be accomplished by including access improvements and
design standards that encourage safe internal circulation.
The severity of crashes is also important. A location with a history of more severe accidents,
which result in personal injuries instead of just “fender benders,” may need special attention
even if the rate is below the thresholds. In addition, the City monitors accident data and
maintains active records through the police department, which will help identify locations
where crash reduction may help to justify the expenditure of improvement funds.

G. Improvements Planning and Scheduling
The City of Richmond does not have a Road Condition Survey or a formalized Road
Management Plan. The plan is based upon complaints, emergencies, new developments,
complexity of the job and the cost. The city paves a specified amount of roadway miles each year.
The city also receives a specified amount of state funds for local projects that occur on state or
federal roads.
Newer roads are built to current specifications for drainage and road width. When older roads
are repaved, they are brought up to current specifications for drainage and width. State and local
funds are used for all major road construction that involves capital improvements, curbing,
culverts, engineering fees, and major overhauls. For state and national roads, the city pays a
maximum of ten (10) percent of up front, design costs, and a total twenty (20) percent for an
entire project. State and federal contributions total eighty (80) percent. This was the case with
modifications to the I-70 and U.S. 27 interchange completed in 2003.
Richmond does not have a mapping system for the city sidewalks, nor is there a sidewalk
condition survey. The installation and maintenance of sidewalks are costly, so the city does not
make this amenity a priority. Often, sidewalks create conflicts occur with personal property.
Sidewalk repairs are scheduled when an adjoining road is repaired. Sidewalks are located in the
city along most major routes, but lack pedestrian signage or designated pedestrian crossings in
some areas. Clear pedestrian crossings with signage are located on National Road West (Hwy
40) and College Avenue to access Earlham College, and in the downtown area. Curbs and
sidewalks are planned as part of upcoming improvements for National Road West, and the I70/Hwy 27 interchange area. Sidewalk maintenance on state roads is the responsibility of the
city.
Currently, the city’s plan is to maintain the existing roadway facilities within the city, because
the funds available for improvements are limited. There are a few major transportation projects
scheduled for Richmond by 2010. Projects include state routes and city roads. Scheduled
projects listed in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program for fiscal years 2005-2007,
and 2006-2008 (draft) include (also see Planned Transportation Improvement Projects Map):
•

I-70 is scheduled by INDOT to add two additional travel lanes between S.R. 1 in Wayne
County to the Ohio State Line (length of 19 miles) in 2010.

•

Industries Road is currently under construction to extend east of Hwy 27 into the
planned medical campus. The road will extend south internal to the development and
connect to University Boulevard. The city recognizes the need to improve Industries
Road from Williamsburg Pike west to Round Barn Road, and from North West 5th Street
to Highway 27 as a long-term project.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 203

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 204

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

The INDOT has also earmarked $215,000 in fiscal year 2007 for navigation and wayfinding
signage on various roads in the City of Richmond.

H. Rights-of-Way
An evaluation of Richmond’s will determine the space available for future sidewalks,
landscaping, streetlights, signage, pedestrian amenities, roadway expansion, and other road
improvements. The rights-of-way along the primary north-south streets tend to vary, while the
rights-of-way along the east-west streets remain fairly constant. Due to the age of many of these
streets, the available right-of-way is limited to the original sixty-six foot width. This condition
inhibits future expansion due to complications and increased costs. The shallow building
setbacks for the existing development reflect the current right of way. In many cases, the existing
right-of-way width will have lane configurations that are sufficient for existing and projected
traffic volumes.

I. Public Transportation
Roseview Transit Service
Roseview Transit provides fixed route bus service in Richmond. Hours of service are Monday
through Friday, 6:15 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., and Saturday 10:15 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Demand (on-call)
service only is provided after 4:30 p.m. and no Sunday service is provided. The system operates
six (6) routes throughout the city (see Route map). Service frequency is one-half hour for all
routes and stops are posted along the roadways and are located past the nearest intersection. No
bus pull-out areas, shelters, benches, or service information are provided at the stops. New signs
were placed at approximately forty (40) bus stops in late 2004/early 2005. All buses are liftequipped for the disabled but not equipped with bike carrying capabilities. Roseview Transit
provides paratransit service for the elderly and disabled population. Paratransit, functionally
defined, is a transportation service, which does not have a fixed route. It is characterized by
many origins and many destinations. It is also known as demand-responsive because all trips are
arranged by appointment. Special stops are also provided at Reid Hospital and State Hospital.
Buses also provide hourly and half-hourly service at five (5) apartment complexes within the city.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 205

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

Roseview Transit Service Map

Roseview Transit does not conduct a six (6) year Transit Development Program to identify a
short-term list of capital and operations and maintenance needs, or a long range transit plan.
Operational, maintenance and administrative costs are primarily dependent on federal funds
rather than state assistance and fare revenues. Generally, transit fares account for up to twenty
(20) percent of revenue generation. Federal grants are the main source of transit funding. The
transit service plans to continue to operate with its existing fleet size and preventive
maintenance plan. Routes are subject to change based on demand and potential reallocation of
vehicles to high-demand areas.
With limited available federal funds, no service increases or route additions are planned with the
exception of shuttle service between the I-70 interchange area and new medical campus and
hospital location at U.S. 27 and Industries Road in 2007. The campus area could potentially
provide Transit Oriented Development (TOD) opportunities with the integration of shuttle
service. Transit Oriented Development areas focus a mix of land-uses, such as residential, office,
shopping, civic uses, and entertainment within easy walking distance from a transit station (1/4
mi., 5-10 minutes). This mix of uses, combined with thoughtfully designed community spaces,
plazas, etc., forms a vibrant village-like neighborhood where people can live, work, and play.
Such a village is compact in size, pedestrian-friendly in design, can be customized to offer a wide
variety of housing options, with convenient access to services, jobs, and plenty of ways to get
around. The U.S. 27 corridor could provide transit connection areas that can serve as hubs for
connecting non-motorized travelers to local transit services.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 206

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

J. Rail
There are two active main rail lines in the city. The northern line runs northwest and southeast,
turning south past Hwy 40. Operated by Norfolk Southern Railroad, this line provides rail
service via a spur line to an industrial park located on South D Street west on Industrial Parkway
on the east side of the city, and via the main line to the Midwest Industrial Park located on the
northwest side of the city. Norfolk Southern is one of four primary operational lines in this
service area, averaging twenty-two trains per day in 2004. The line provides through freight
service from Chicago to Cincinnati, continuing to Atlanta and points south. A rail junction area
exists in the vicinity bordered by Sheridan, Northwest 5th, Northwest J, and Northeast E Streets.
A rail spur also extends north in the area of Hunt Street and serves additional industrial land
uses, while another spur line extends west from Sheridan to Northwest First Street. This line
runs diagonally with the city’s grid street pattern and can cause traffic congestion at rail
crossings. Grade separations exist at North 20th Street, Hwy 27, and Northwest 4th Street.
Norfolk Southern anticipates significant opportunities for growth in rail operations along this
line, with the potential future expansion of between one and two tracks.
The second line is operated by CSX Railroad and is located on the south side of the city, running
primarily north into the city and terminating near the intersection of South 2nd Street and Hwy
40. The rail line follows parallel with the street system with limited crossings. The nearest
Amtrak Station is located southwest of Richmond in Connersville, Indiana.

K. Air
While the Richmond Municipal Airport currently serves small private aviation needs, its
proximity to the City and I-70 corridor, coupled with its location between Indianapolis and
Dayton, suggest a greater future potential as a primary part of the overall local and regional
transportation system. Good vehicular access, a growing industrial/employment base, and a
convenient location offer great promise for the airport facility.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) states that increased passenger traffic and larger
aircraft will severely strain existing airports in the coming years. As a result, the FAA is currently
focusing on new large aircraft, terminal building planning, and facilities and systems for
passenger access to airports. Therefore, the City of Richmond may consider the opportunities
offered to the Municipal Airport by the following trends within the aviation industry:
•
•
•
•
•

Improved market position for newer, lower-cost commercial carriers that
concentrate on short-haul service.
Increased demand by the airlines for smaller 30-100 passenger aircraft.
Growing demand for business, corporate and chartered aircraft.
Increased usage of smaller hub and metropolitan general aviation airports.
The growth of airports that specialize in cargo service.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 207

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

Benefits of a Regional Airport
Aviation services can play a substantial role in the State and regional economy. Indiana’s public
airports contributed an economic impact of $4.8 million in 2001, an increase of approximately $3
million since 1991 (source: Aviation Association of Indiana Economic Impact Study, 2002). The
key economic contributions of having aviation services located close to the City of Richmond
include:
• Operating efficiencies gained by local businesses because of air service.
• A majority of tourists, conventioneers, and business travelers to the region arrive via
commercial air service.
• Potential to attract companies that provide a wide variety of professional services to
both national and overseas clients.
• Airlines, airports, and businesses that support public airports provide jobs and
income within the region.
• Government agencies that are responsible for functions such as fire suppression,
disaster response, and law enforcement rely upon air service and airports to
effectively carry out their missions.
• Aviation generates tax revenue through personal property taxes, taxable aviation
gasoline revenues, taxable aircraft jet fuel, excise tax revenues, and sales tax on
general aviation aircrafts.
In addition to the above benefits, an expansion of aviation services at the Richmond Municipal
Airport could greatly enhance the quality of business, personal and family life. Aviation service
affects life in Richmond in numerous ways, including:
•

Catalyst for Economic Development: Many companies locate in a community because
of the presence of an airport. An increasing number of companies and executives are
avoiding the “hassle factor” of commercial airports and airlines by opting to use
corporate charter air services for business travel, typically operating from smaller
airports. With the expansion of the Richmond Municipal Airport as a regional-serving
facility, the City should consider a marketing effort to try to attract regional or national
corporate headquarters.

•

Convenient Venues for Business Activities: Airports that offer convenient schedules to
and from multiple destinations are efficient meeting venues for government officials,
executives, managers, and decision-makers. General aviation airports serve as offices to
“briefcase businesses.” Expansion plans should include meeting rooms and conference
areas that allow business meetings to take place directly on the site.

•

International Export of Goods and Services: Air transport is critical for those
companies that export goods internationally and participate in a global economy.
Consideration should be made to offer an international shipment center at the Richmond
Regional Airport to serve companies with a global focus.

•

Air Cargo Services: Air cargo, consisting mainly of high-value, time-sensitive documents
and goods, can play a significant role in the vitality of the region’s economy. Expedient
delivery of goods and services is essential to many manufacturing, e-commerce, catalog,
and service businesses. Postal services depend on air transportation for timely delivery
of small packages, and air cargo carriers provide air express service. Air cargo storage
and distribution facilities should be considered in the development of an airport area
plan.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 208

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

•

Agriculture: A regional airport can contribute greatly to the success of the region’s
agricultural industry, providing services for export shipment, corporate travel, crop
dusting, crop storage facilities, and aerial photography. Located in a rural area and
surrounded by agricultural fields, the airport needs to recognize the importance of the
agriculture industry within the area and provide such facilities to assist with the
distribution of local goods.

•

Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response: An airport is critical for providing
emergency response services to areas, and plays an important role in disaster
preparedness and response. As a regional airport, the Richmond Municipal Airport
could serve as a base to conduct emergency preparedness training. A facilities plan
should include areas to conduct such training, including classrooms and outdoor activity
areas.

•

Medical Services: Many emergency and critical medical services are provided through
aviation, including medical and life flights, flights carrying donated organs, and the
retention of specialized medical professionals. An important use of the airport upon
expansion is the ability to handle jets that provide emergency and medical services.

•

Education and Training: Many smaller airports such as the Richmond Municipal
Airport serve aviation-related training and education functions that concentrate on
technological innovation. The students and visitors that take part in these training
programs spend local dollars at hotels, restaurants, shops, and service establishments. A
facilities plan should include areas to conduct such training, including classrooms and
outdoor activity areas.

•

Airports as Civic Partners: The Richmond Municipal Airport could be a destination
facility for special events such as air shows, fundraising events benefiting local charities,
and meetings or services for local non-profit organizations. They may also provide
educational information and events for local schools and youth groups.

•

Managing Airport as a “System”: The Richmond Municipal Airport has the
opportunity to provide a wide range of air services to growing communities within the
region and serve businesses along the I-70 corridor. The airport system could support
businesses from high technology and medical anticipated on the north side of the City, to
small companies and industries located at the Midwest Industrial Park and businesses
located south of U.S. 40 off Industrial Parkway. The airport could also provide a spur
connection to the Norfolk Southern Railroad line as a way to transport goods and
services.

•

Recognition of Historic Significance. The airport is potentially eligible for designation
within the National Register of Historic Places, which would make a small amount of
money available for restoration work. Listing in the Register could make federal
transportation enhancement funds more likely available.

Development of a System Plan
The Indiana State Aviation System Plan (ISASP) (2003 Update) describes the aviation system as
a journey, which begins with ground access to the airport. The ISASP is the principal means by
which the State identifies airports to serve present and future air transportation needs, and to
identify airport development projects, which are consistent with state policies and priorities.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 209

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

The ISASP plan is also designed to allocate federal, state, and local matching funds for airport
improvements.
The development of a system plan for the Richmond Municipal Airport should include the
following considerations:
•

Airport Access: The airport currently has direct access from Richmond along
S.R. 227. Consideration will need to be given toward roadway improvements,
including resurfacing and lane expansion, as demand for aviation services grows.
Direct access via I-70 and an expansion of transit service to the airport should be
considered. An extension of the Norfolk Southern Rail Line or the CSX Railroad
through a rail spur should be considered as an alternative to transport goods to
local businesses.

•

Airport Facilities and Services: The current airport facilities and anticipated
increase in private carrier frequency are conducive to smaller, private carrier use
only. The FAA forecasts suggest that in order to increase capacity utilization
and “stretch” of existing infrastructure, upgrades are needed to accommodate air
traffic and to distribute utilization more evenly given the expected growth of
regional jet service to smaller cities and the availability of smaller “personal” or
micro-jets. As a result, an opportunity may exist to upgrade the Richmond
Municipal Airport to become a “relief” facility and handle regional jet services.

In order to serve the region and become a “relief”
airport for commercial carriers that would otherwise
travel to Indianapolis, Cincinnati or Dayton, the airport
will need to be expanded. A master planning effort will
be needed to determine the space requirements and
design parameters of an expanded facility. Upgrades
such as water and sewer lines, a control tower,
additional runways and hangars, and storage facilities
will likely be needed. A water line is needed to the
airport. There is currently no storm sewer. The current
sanitary hook up is to Boston, Indiana but the overall
capacity is unknown. In general, the site needs a
variety of infrastructure improvements including but
not limited to replacement of the ILS (Instrument
Landing System), repair/replacement of the main
hanger and improvement to the terminal.
Richmond Municipal Airport

•

Airport Vicinity Land Use: Land surrounding
the airport would most likely be developed with expanded and complementary aviation
services. A market study should be performed to assist in identifying future development
opportunities and related uses for adjoining lands. A land planning effort in partnership
with Wayne County would also assist in determining the development design, layout,
and intensity. This may entail the adoption of specific zoning provisions to ensure land
use compatibility surrounding the airport.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 210

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

•

Airspace Access: Within the State of Indiana, the INDOT Aeronautics Section is
responsible for promoting aviation safety. All private and public-use landing facilities are
required to receive a Certificate of Site Approval. The airport is required to have an
approved FAA Airspace Determination. Different applications need to be completed
with the State based on the type of airport planned (public, private, etc.).

Overall, the Richmond Municipal Airport has the potential to be a strong asset for the region to
serve residents and businesses, alike. The intent of the recommendations made in this Plan is to
position the airport to successfully meet the region’s future aviation and economic development
needs, serving as a catalyst for the future prosperity of the community and surrounding region.

L. Land Use/Transportation Linkages
A link between transportation and land use is visible in the historical development pattern of
Richmond (also refer to the existing land use map). Transportation routes and access provided
opportunities for residential development. This residential development, which also occurred
due to factors such as available land supply, lower development costs, and convenient access to
emerging employment centers, and other period-specific social and cultural factors, brought
other land use activities. For example, commercial uses followed residential growth. Further,
larger scale regional commercial centers were attracted by the accessibility to the growing trade
area population and market throughout the area by Interstate 70 (I-70), Highway 40, and
Highway 27. The growing traffic counts attracted still other businesses to the commercial and
industrial areas of the community.
While a variety of factors involving available land, lower development costs, convenience, and
labor markets resulted in industrial land development, industrial development patterns remain
principally related to transportation access. Older industrial uses developed near rail lines. Most
new, significant industrial (and also office) uses have developed along major roadways and
freeways. This historical development trend is readily apparent in Richmond. Industrial and
other intensive land uses have occurred along major street corridors, with interchange access to
freeways and interstates, adjacent to I-70.
Investment in the transportation system to meet the needs of various land uses has been a
priority in the city. Continuous roadway improvements have improved the capacity and traffic
operations to and through the main commercial and employment areas. Several of the more
recent projects include bridges, lane improvements, signage and streetscaping that improve
aesthetics in addition to operational benefits. Progress has also been made toward a nonmotorized system of bikeways and walkways with the support of the Cardinal-Greenway Trail.
In Richmond, transportation investments are intended to ensure a comprehensive transportation
system, to preserve the quality of life for residents and retain a desirable business climate. The
future vision for Richmond involves a balanced and coordinated, multi-modal transportation
system to accommodate ongoing growth and development. Thus, recommendations are provided
both for the street system and modes other than the automobile, such as walking, bicycling, or
use of transit. A convenient, congestion free, safe and multi-modal transportation system will
continue to be an important goal for the community.
While Richmond has control over most of the streets within the city, cooperation from other
agencies is needed. The Indiana Department of Transportation and Federal Highway
Administration control the allocation of state and federal dollars for transportation
improvements.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 211

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

Another document that lists more specific recommendations, using this Plan as the foundation, is
the City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP). The CIP identifies transportation
improvements, along with priorities, estimated costs, and funding mechanisms.
Movement is a defining characteristic of life, and we travel to access our work, school, shopping,
and entertainment opportunities. For most of us, travel itself is not the purpose, but rather it is
the accessibility provided by the transportation system that contributes to our quality of life.
The efficient movement of people and goods through and within Richmond depends on an
organized and well-planned system of highways, roads, walkways, trails, and transit options. A
system of roadways, transit corridors, bikeways and paths tie the city together, creates a system
of movement within which regional centers, neighborhood centers, and residential centers are
located. Major transit corridors connect the city to the region. Primary streets, high frequency
transit corridors, and major bikeways connect the city within itself; and trails and paths connect
the city to its natural surroundings.

M. Strategies and Recommendations
T R 1. Transportation Plan
The City should consider preparing a comprehensive transportation plan. This document should
include complete data collection of traffic counts, road cross sections, signalization and timing
information, and an update of crash statistics. The Plan should be a cooperative effort between
the county, city engineering department, and the police department.
More specific road improvements should be considered including road widening or narrowing
based on traffic volumes and function, intersection improvements based on traffic volumes and
crash data, opportunities to utilize new transportation technology, and a complete study of oneway pairs in the city.
A Coordinated Development Review Process and Committee for All Applications should be
established – City of Richmond/Wayne County
T R 2. Street and Corridor Character
Street width and scale, presence of on-street parking and sidewalks, block length, building
setbacks, design speed, street trees and even pavement markings and signs all contribute to the
functions of the street and the perceptions of the driver. Driver perceptions can affect vehicle
speed and the care used in driving. The character of the roadway corridor as viewed by the
motorist also impacts the image of the community.
Successful commercial corridors should be free of unsightly clutter and easy to navigate to find a
destination. Streets in residential areas should cause speeds to be reduced. In some cases, the
road design elements in the city reinforce the desired image. In other cases, improvements need
to be considered. This Plan relies on a wide range of concepts to help ensure the future
transportation system operates safely and efficiently, but also in context with the character of
the city.
T R 3. Expressway Viewsheds
Visitors’ first perceptions of Richmond are largely created from views along the expressways or
from their experience if exiting at the interchanges. A number of techniques can be used to help
promote the quality image for the interchange areas at I-70 and Williamsburg Pike, Hwy 27,
Middleboro Pike (S.R. 227), and Hwy 40.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 212

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

•

•
•

Work with the INDOT to coordinate improvements to I-70 and use context-sensitive
design techniques to provide diverse materials for bridges and medians, extensive
landscaping and appropriate lighting so the expressways contribute to the urban
landscape.
Promote use of the state’s standard freeway logo signs and informative signs along the
expressways to help direct motorists to local activity areas.
Apply access management and special zoning standards to help ensure uses near
interchanges are well designed in terms of access, landscaping, lighting and signs.

T R 4. Route Designations
The identification of specific routes for types of traffic ranging from truck and hazardous
materials transport routes to bicycle routes should be included in the creation of an overall
transportation plan. Truck and hazardous material routes should be identified along primary
routes to industrial areas and guide traffic from the interstate to such points of destination. It is
important to keep such traffic away from the downtown and residential areas.
Signage and pavement striping can be used to designate on-street bike routes throughout the city
in an effort to facilitate the use of alternative transportation modes and provide an
interconnected motorized and non-motorized transportation system.
T R 5. Major Street Corridors
Travelers along city streets encounter a diverse
mixture of land uses and a range of physical
characteristics. The spectrum ranges from treelined residential streets with sidewalks to
commercial arterials with a complexity of signs,
parking, traffic controls, and turning movements.
Major institutional, research, and industrial uses
usually fall between those two extremes of
intensity.
Land use and transportation are obviously closely
linked. Arterial corridors offer a prime example of
the relationship of land use and traffic. Therefore,
Source: LSL
an evaluation of major streets must consider the
entire “corridor” along that street. A corridor is
defined as not only the street, but also sidewalks, streetscape and the adjacent sites extending
from building face to building face. A “zone of influence” that extends beyond those boundaries
also affects the corridor, such as nearby major land uses with their primary access to the corridor.
Both land use and traffic characteristics along major streets were inventoried to help plan for the
development and redevelopment, as needed. This evaluation considered potential land uses that
would complement the existing character and the traffic carrying capability of the streets.

Using the “character” approach, the major corridors were classified into three categories. Some
corridors can be placed entirely within one category. Other corridors exhibit varying
characteristics and may change category from one segment to another. The category used to
identify the major thoroughfare corridor or segment thereof is particularly important in
identifying and programming planned actions to address problems. The three major thoroughfare
corridor categories are described below and illustrated on the Corridor Character Map at the end
of the chapter.
•

“Preservation Corridors” are streets such as portions of U.S. 27 and U.S. 40, which pass
through areas where the potential for significant redevelopment or conversions from one
land use to another exists. These parcels should be reviewed with an eye toward
preventing land use and thoroughfare conflicts through application of zoning and access
management standards. Streets in this category have the opportunity to contribute
positively to a well- coordinated transportation system in a setting consistent with the
desired character of the corridor.

•

“Correction Corridors” are streets bounded primarily by commercial and/or industrial
uses. Traffic volumes along several of these corridors are well above the capacity
envisioned when the roads and right-of-way were conceived. For example, some
expressway interchanges were not designed for the level of use today. Other corridors,
such as the segment of U.S. 27 between Industrial Drive and North J Street, developed
over a period of years under old street design, subdivision, and zoning/site plan design
standards that did not contemplate today’s volume and did not reflect the city’s current
design philosophy. These corridors are complex, with confusion, traffic congestion,
intensive activity, and/or an incomplete transportation network. These corridors are in
need of multiple actions, such as widening and medians, to correct problems that
resulted from cumulative changes over time.

•

“Expressway Viewshed Corridors” are areas either along a freeway or expressway or
at interchanges that act to serve as a “front door” to motorists traveling along these
roadways. Expressway Viewshed Corridors within the study area are located along I-70.
Key interchange areas are located at Williamsburg Pike Road, U.S. 27, Middleboro Pike
(S.R. 227), and U.S. 40. These interchanges are in need of significant enhancements to
make a dramatic statement that one has arrived in the City of Richmond. Such
enhancements include:
• “Welcome to Richmond” signs;
• Enhanced landscaping including street trees and flowerbeds;
• Ornamental features such as lighting, benches and banners; and
• Extended gateway treatment along the roadways for one or two blocks.
Improvements to the appearance of the corridor along I-70 could include the addition of
landscaping, signs and lighting, and screening of outdoor storage and loading areas.
Some of these corrective actions will occur gradually over time as land uses change. The
zoning ordinance should assure site plans are reviewed when uses change or expand so
that upgrades to the site features can be applied.

T R 6. Specific Major Street Corridor Recommendations
Based on as assessment of existing conditions and public comments, the following specific
improvements are identified for Hwy 40 and Hwy 27, the two main corridors within the city and
also an improvement of Salisbury Road from Industries Road to US 35:
•

Hwy 40 (Main Street). The streetscape should be improved outside of the downtown
area to accommodate a continuous sidewalk system on both sides of the road. A
boulevard with street trees and lawn should be considered for approximately ¼ mile
along Hwy 40 from the city limits. The feasibility of on-street bike lanes should be
considered. The remaining portion of the cross section should be preserved for a
minimum of two lanes of through traffic lanes in each direction. Refer to the gateway
enhancement recommendations for details on entry signage and treatment at the city
limits.

•

Hwy 27 (Chester Boulevard). As mentioned in the existing conditions segment of this
chapter, it is anticipated that traffic volumes will continue to increase on Hwy 27 north
of National Road, specifically near the I-70 interchange, U.S. 27 between University
Boulevard and I-70 Interchange can be expected to increase from 18,210 to 22,570 within
five (5) years (based on the rate of annual increase), with the addition of the new
hospital and medical campus and additional industrial developments. Such
developments and property redevelopments will cause a need to focus on access
management, truck routing, and traffic flow measures. In addition, future improvements
should be coordinated with the I-70/Hwy 27 interchange improvement project from
south of the interchange to North J Street in
2007, and from 1.2 miles north of the
interchange (Tingle Road) to 5.7 miles north
of I-70 in 2007. The city should also
coordinate with Roseview Transit regarding
the potential for bus shelters and pull-outs,
and transfer facilities in anticipation of a
circulator route with increased bus
frequencies.

T R 7. Traffic Calming
Residents expect low volumes of traffic and low
speeds within neighborhoods. Increases in local
traffic, width of streets, and other factors may cause
neighborhood traffic safety and related concerns.

Variation in Speed Humps and Speed Tables

Traffic calming is a way to visually and physically
impede speeding in residential areas. The physical
change in the road parameters and the psychological
change in the “feel” of the road combine to reduce the
speed of vehicles. Some of the most common traffic
calming devices includes:
Street Narrowing, Slow Points or Chokers
Source: LSL

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 215

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

•

Speed humps are vertical constraints on vehicular speed and are designed according to a
safe vehicle speed (15 to 20 mph). They are raised areas that extend across the width of
the pavement and range between 2-4 inches in height and 14-22 ft in length.
Specifications on speed hump design are site specific and dimensions are unique to each
location.

•

Speed tables are vertical constraints, similar to speed humps, constructed with a table
or flat portion in the center. They can create a street environment that is pedestrian
friendly by being used in combination as a raised crosswalk. They provide visual
enhancement, reduce vehicle speed and enhance the use of non-motorized
transportation. Unlike speed bumps, speed tables are designed to allow traffic
movement and can even accommodate snow plowing.

•

Street narrowing, slow points, or chokers include curb modifications, channelization,
and sometimes landscaping features that narrow the street to a minimum safe width.
They are often installed at intersections to reduce speed and/or redirect traffic. They
provide larger areas for landscaping, enhance the neighborhood, facilitate loading and
unloading, and optimize the pedestrian crossing locations.

•

Angle points or chicanes are curbed horizontal deflections in the path of vehicle travel.
They are built along the edge of the travel-way similar to street narrowing treatments.
They use physical obstacles and parking bays, and are staggered so drivers must slow
down in order to maneuver through the street. Trees are often used at the slow point to
restrict driver vision and create a feeling of a “closed” street.

•

Boulevard slow points or channelization include center located islands that divide the
opposing travel lanes at intersections or at mid-blocks, pedestrian refuge treatments, and
the other standard forms of intersection traffic control islands. These are aimed at
reducing speeds while enhancing the pedestrian crossing points and safety.

•

Intersection diverters are features that partially close an intersection to limit the
allowable turning movements and divert traffic. They are used to convert an intersection
into two unconnected streets, each making a sharp turn. This alters traffic flow patterns
and limits the ability of vehicles to cut through residential neighborhoods.

•

Street closures are highly constrictive and affect the network traffic flow by eliminating
neighborhood traffic from cutting through. Closure may be an option where there is a
correctable crash history. Road closures are generally a poor choice, since traffic may
just divert to other streets and repeat the problems elsewhere. Also access by emergency
vehicles is impeded.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 216

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

•

Roundabouts are raised, center rotary
islands that are used as a replacement for
traffic signals and stop signs at intersections.
While these can be used as an effective
intersection control, they also have an added
traffic-calming benefit by deflecting vehicles
out of their normal path, slowing traffic, and
reducing the number of conflict points. They
also improve capacity and safety of the
intersection and improve neighborhood
aesthetics. Modern American roundabouts
Roundabout
are also being used at a growing number of
Source: drivers.com
locations as alternatives to signals along
arterial streets. Smaller scale “traffic circles”
are also being used on non-arterial streets.

•

Perimeter treatments are visual and physical treatments used to communicate a
message to drivers entering a residential neighborhood. Traffic signs, intersection
narrowing, boulevards, textured pavement surfaces such as brick and landscaping
features are often used to create this effect. Entry treatments are used to increase driver
awareness to changes in roadway environment.

Residential developers should be specifically encouraged to incorporate traffic calming measures
during the planning and design phases of new residential areas. Where appropriate, these
concepts greatly reduce future problems and will help maintain the value of the neighborhood.
The cost of a traffic calming measure when incorporated in the planning and design phases of the
project is minimal. However, retrofitting an existing intersection or residential roadway segment
with traffic calming measures could be significantly more expensive.
With regard to existing situations in developed neighborhoods, “retrofitting” traffic calming
measures may also be appropriate. For example, there may be complaints about cut-through
traffic, especially when the adjacent arterial streets become congested, and motorists begin
seeking alternate routes. In some cases, the traffic problems are just a perception, but in other
cases there may be a problem to address. Installation of stop signs is a common response, but
studies have shown they are not always effective in producing desired results.
Alternatives to stop signs could be considered, especially where the location does not meet
“warrants” specified by the State of Indiana. Where such concerns arise, the city may wish to
follow the following three-step sequence used successfully by other cities:
•

Document the problem. This could involve speed studies or evaluation to determine if
there is an unusually high percentage of cut-through traffic. Some communities involve
the residents in this process as an educational element as often they realize their
neighbors are the speeders. The neighborhood can then work to reduce the problem
with help from the city.

•

Where a documented problem exists, such as more than 15% of the vehicles traveling
over 30mph, corrective measures may be needed. The first step is typically enforcement,
speed monitor signs, and other simple methods to slow traffic or direct it to more
appropriate streets.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 217

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

•

Where measures are needed, one of the variety of tools mentioned above can be used to
alter driver behavior and help traffic fit the character of the area.

To conclude, implementing a traffic calming program within new residential developments or to
address circumstances within existing developed areas, should involve the following:
•

Traffic calming measures should be examined from an area-wide traffic calming
perspective.

•

Traffic calming measures should be used as speed controls rather than volume controls
to prevent the diversion of through-traffic to parallel residential streets.

•

It is important to highlight the presence of traffic calming measures by landscaping and
treating the street edges. These measures complement the engineering design by
softening the appearance of speed humps and enhancing the appearance of more
aesthetic measures such as chicanes and traffic circles. Also, landscaping measures can
enhance engineering measures and make them more effective and safer by highlighting
their presence.

•

Traffic calming devices should be designed in coordination with emergency services to
ensure that safe emergency vehicle access is maintained to all areas. Details such as
mountable curbs and gutters can often help resolve access problems.
A risk management program should be implemented to minimize liability issues through
proper location, design, signage, marking and lighting of traffic calming devices.

•

T R 8. Street Capacity & Operational Improvements
Street capacity refers to the capability of a roadway to accommodate the expected traffic flow
with an acceptable amount of delay, i.e. minimal congestion. Traffic engineers measure this
capacity through a comparison of the volumes, usually during the peak hour, to the designed
capacity. This determines the amount of average delay per vehicle. This statistical analysis is
then translated into a “level-of-service” from A-F. Streets with current or projected poor traffic
operations should be designated for improvements. Actual traffic conditions, including crashes,
will need to be frequently monitored to adjust the list of recommended projects in a Capital
Improvement Program.
Future traffic conditions should also consider land use and socio-economic factors. Street
improvement projects typically fall into two major categories: Capacity Expansion Projects and
Capacity Preservation Projects. Capacity Expansion projects include widening major roadway
that will add lanes, new roadways, and new freeway interchanges. Capacity Preservation
Projects include reconstruction without addition of lanes, signal improvements, or enhancement
actions such as bikeways, walkways, landscaping, and historic preservation. Pavement
management, bridge maintenance, and many types of safety improvements are included in the
preservation category.
Major planned transportation improvements are illustrated on maps at the end of this chapter
and a more detailed list of proposed projects including the year that improvements are scheduled
to occur can be found in the existing conditions section under the subsection titled,
Improvements Planning and Scheduling.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 218

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

In addition to street improvements, the city can help manage traffic through a variety of tools to
reduce vehicle trips or lessen their impact. These various “transportation management” tools are
described in the next section.

N. Transportation Management Techniques
The concept of transportation management is simple. Every automobile trip that can be
eliminated by giving people other choices, such as transit or walking will help to relieve the
street system, as will a land use arrangement that shortens trips. Every driveway that is
eliminated or redesigned will help preserve capacity and reduce potential for accidents. Current
streets may be able to operate better with new technology, such as signals that respond to actual
traffic conditions or informing motorists of alternate routes when there is congestion or an
accident. Collectively, these ideas will help address the city’s transportation needs in the future.
Another tool to help address traffic flow is to reduce the amount of travel demand, especially
during the peak travel hours when congestion is most prevalent. This approach, called demand
management, can involve working with major employers to revise shifts or offer flexible hours to
reduce peak demands. Other ideas could be to encourage use of transit for employees by
working with Roseview Transit on scheduling and to ensure site plans are designed in a “transit
friendly” way.
Traffic Impact Analysis
One procedure to help ensure that traffic impacts are properly evaluated is to require a traffic
impact study prior to approving site plans, rezoning, or special uses for significant projects.
Generally, a traffic impact study is recommended for a project that would generate 50 or more
directional (one-way) trips in the peak hour or 500 trips in an average day. A well prepared
traffic impact study will also address site access issues, such as the potential to share access or
use service drives. The study should analyze options to mitigate traffic impacts, such as changes
to access or improvements to the roadway. In some cases, the developer may assist in funding
improvements to help offset the direct impacts of the project.

Access Management
Widening and intersection improvements are not the only ways to improve traffic operations
along a street. One technique to help preserve capacity and promote safety while delaying or
avoiding the need for widening is access management. Access management involves
comprehensive controls to minimize conflict points, reduce the potential for accidents, and help
preserve the street’s ability to carry traffic.
Access management standards could be applied
to new development proposals, and during road
improvements to revise existing access that does
not meet the current standards. A general review
of access management concepts is provided
below, and provides a foundation for a Codified
Access Management Ordinance.

Driveway Spacing from Intersections
Source: LSL

•

Number of Access Points. The number of driveways allowed along major streets affects
traffic flow, ease of driving, and accident potential. Reasonable access must, however, be
provided for each use. If direct access to the adjacent roadway is necessary, the number
of access points should be limited to one where possible. Every effort to limit the number
of driveways; and encourage access off side streets, service drives, frontage roads, and
shared driveways will help.

•

Driveway Spacing from Intersections. The minimum spacing of access points from
intersections should be in accordance with the table below (measured from pavement
edge to pavement edge as shown on the figure):
Signalized locations: *
• along U.S. 27 and Hwy 40
• along other public streets

300 feet
200 feet

Unsignalized locations:
• along U.S. 27 and Hwy 40
• intersections with U.S. 27 and Hwy 40
• other intersections

300 feet
300 feet
150 feet

* Spacing shown for signalized intersections should also be applied at intersections where INDOT
indicates spacing and approach volumes may warrant a signal in the future.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 220

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

Changes to these guidelines should only be
considered if it can be demonstrated by a traffic
impact study that the driveway operation will
not result in conflicts with vehicles at the
adjacent intersection. These guidelines can also
generally be applied to spacing from access
points on the opposite side of the street.
Frontage Road Minimum Setbacks
Preferably, major access points should be aligned Source: LSL
with, or 250 feet from, major access points on the
opposite side of the street. The actual
dimensions will vary depending upon existing
and expected turning movements.
Alternative Access. Alternative access should
be encouraged along arterials, such as shared
driveways, rear service drives, or frontage
roads. Commercial developments and parking
lots should be connected through front or rear
service drives. Frontage drives, rear service
drives, shared driveways, and connected
parking lots should be used to minimize the
number of individual driveways along major
streets, while preserving the property owner's
Frontage roads or service drives should be
constructed in accordance with the following
standards:
A. Service drives and frontage roads
should be set back as far as
reasonably possible from the
intersection of the access driveway
with the public street. A minimum
of eighty (80) feet should be
maintained between the public
street centerline and the pavement
of the frontage road, with a
minimum sixty (60) feet of throat
depth provided at the access point,
as measured from exit lane stop
bar to service drive.
B. The alignment of the service drive
can be refined to meet the needs of
the site and anticipated traffic
conditions, provided the resulting
terminus allows the drive to be
extended through the adjacent
site(s).

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

In areas within one-quarter mile of existing or future signal locations, access to
individual properties should be provided via these alternative access methods rather
than by direct connection to a major arterial. Ideally, this should be through a rear
service drive (a rear service drive has adequate depth for on-site stacking, compared to a
"frontage" road).
In the case of existing, proposed or recommended rear service drives, additional access to
individual properties may be allowed through direct connection to the adjacent arterial
street, provided that movements at these driveways are restricted to right turns into
and/or out of the site, and are appropriately spaced as discussed later in this section.
•

Driveway Spacing from Expressway Ramps. A minimum of 600 feet is recommended
between expressway ramps and any driveway.

•

Driveway Spacing from Other Driveways. Minimum and desirable driveway spacing
requirements should be determined based on posted speed limits along the parcel
frontage, traffic conditions, and sight distance and in consideration of the amount of
traffic a particular use is expected to generate. Guidelines are shown on Table 8-1 but
can be varied upon specific findings and in consideration of published traffic engineering
manuals such as the AASHTO Greenbook.
The "desirable" values provided in Table 8-1 are based on the sight distance necessary to
allow an egressing vehicle to enter the arterial traffic stream without causing oncoming
traffic to decrease their speed by more than 10 mph, and should be required where parcel
size permits. The "minimum" values in the table are based on the distances required to
avoid conflicts between vehicles turning right or left from adjacent driveways. In order to
prevent left turn conflicts, possible driveways should be aligned with those across the
street or offset a sufficient distance from driveways across the street in accordance with
the minimum spacing standards listed in the table. In the case of expansion, alteration,
or redesign of existing development where it can be demonstrated that pre-existing
conditions prohibit adherence to the minimum driveway spacing standards, the
driveway spacing requirements could be modified, but the recommended driveway
spacing should not be reduced by more than 60 feet.

Right-of-Way Preservation

they are expected to handle now or in the future. The right-of-way and development along
several segments limit road widening, intersection improvements, installation of boulevards,
and/or the addition of desired bike paths. Acquisition of additional right-of-way to
accommodate desired improvements can delay projects and escalate costs. The advance right-ofway acquisition process also reduces later disruption to homes and businesses that would
otherwise need to relocate or redesign their site.
A cooperative effort to preserve right-of-way in advance of the planned roadway improvements
could help address this issue. Three methods that could be considered are negotiations to donate
lands during development approvals, advanced acquisition, or preservation through clustering.

APRIL 2006 | RICHMOND, INDIANA | 222

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TRANSPORTATION

1.

Donation. Landowners and developers often understand the benefits of donation of land
needed for right-of-way. Land donation can expedite improvements that will benefit the
landowner. A landowner may also be eligible for tax benefits through donation or
dedication. In some cases, the city may wish to support variances from setbacks where
the setback from the new right-of-way would create a non-conforming situation.
Alternatively, the zoning ordinance could include special standards for such situations.

2. Advance acquisition. Traditionally, right-of-way is purchased after the improvement
has been designed. Advanced acquisition could involve purchase at an earlier date when
costs are lower. Some road agencies maintain funds to purchase right-of-way if a
development is proposed where right-of-way will be needed in the future. Thus, the
right-of-way can be purchased at a lower cost.
3. Density Transfer. The city might allow a developer to transfer the density that could
occur in the future right-of-way to another location on the site through special zoning
provisions.

Multi-Modal System Recommendations
A unified multi-modal system for the city of Richmond with connections between modes could
provide additional transportation alternatives to a vehicle. The following is a brief description of
its components.

Sidewalks and Pathways

The sidewalk and pathway segment includes three different cross-sections to serve their
intended function. These cross-sections are described below along with their relationship to
other aspects of the Comprehensive Plan.
•
•
•

Sidewalks – five foot wide or greater sidewalks
Multi-Modal Paths – six to eight foot wide sidewalk
Greenway Pathway - eight-ten foot wide pathway

Bus Routes

The plan indicates a linkage between established routes and the other modes of travel offered in
the City. The City should continue to work in collaboration with the transit authority so the
system can respond to changing needs and new development projects. A circulator system
should be considered along Highway 27 to service the new hospital campus and higher education
facilities that are located in close proximity to each other. The route could provide high
frequency service between a downtown transit center and the campuses, while providing
connections to existing routes.

Bus Routes and Multi-Modal Pathways

In instances where there is an important link to a community facility, connection to an
additional transportation mode, or along key transportation routes, the bus route and multimodal pathway routes overlap.

Rail

The multi-modal plan links sidewalks, pathways, and bus routes to the historic train station.
The train station serves as a historic feature to the city and enhancements at the train station are
encouraged.

INTRODUCTION
Part 5: Critical Corridors and Subareas has been
established to provide a summary of several planning studies
and small area plans. The following sections represent
the essence of those studies and plans, and add greater
refinement to transportation and growth management goals
and objectives.
The purpose of this Part is to emphasize that there are certain
areas and corridors in the City that require a greater degree
of planning. They also require a greater level of review
when development proposals are being considered.
The following critical corridors and subareas are included in
this Part:

Critical Corridor and Subarea Descriptions

Each of the critical corridors and subareas listed above has
two to six pages dedicated to describing how it should be
used to manage growth and development in these sensitive
areas. Further, the following headings are used, as described
below, to convey the essence of each critical corridor and
subarea. These descriptions are intended to be conceptual.
Description: This section gives the reader a brief description
of the existing conditions, history, and reasons why the corridor or subarea is considered critically important.
Critical Area Boundaries: This section conveys where each critical corridor or subarea is located within Carmel’s planning
jurisdiction.
Strategy: This section describes the implementation steps,
projects, policies, or programs necessary to achieve the
desired result in the critical corridor or subarea.
Design Guidelines: This section establishes the physical goals
for the critical corridor or subarea. It should be referenced
and used to influence decisions made by the Plan Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, and Common Council when
considering a development proposal.

indication that those critical corridors or subareas have had
more extensive study and planning.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
FUTURE STUDIES AND PLANS
The critical corridors and subareas plans included in
Part 5 are the result of detailed studies or planning efforts
previously completed by the City of Carmel. Therefore, the
content in Part 5 is limited to just those previous studies.
The City recognizes that there are several other “critical”
areas in its planning jurisdiction that remain to be studied or
planned for in detail. It is anticipated that the City will work
toward accomplishing those planning processes as time and
budget permit, and based on impending need.

Potential New Critical Corridors and Subareas

The critical corridors and subareas that may be studied and
planned for include, but are not limited to the following (in
no particular order):
1. West 116th Street
2. East 116th Street
3. 146th Street
4. Michigan Road/U.S. 421
5. East 96th Street
6. Downtown Core
7. White River Greenway
8. Transit Integration and Hub
9. 126th Street and Gray Road District
10. Quarry Land Reclamation and Development
11. Pennsylvania Parkway Extension
12. Hazel Dell Parkway and 131st Street District
13. Monon Greenway Corridor
14. Central Park District

Implementation and Incorporation of New Critical Corridor or
Subarea Plans

It is the desire of the City to formalize a general process and
scope of services to be used for each new critical corridor
or subarea planning project. The intent is to assure public
participation and adherence to a document format that will
allow the results to be integrated into the C3 Plan on two to
eight pages. This will help maintain a uniform, compact and
user-friendly comprehensive plan over the years to come.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
KEYSTONE PARKWAY CORRIDOR
Description

Keystone Parkway has been identified as a critical corridor
because it:
• Serves as major north/south arterial;
• Establishes a division between the urbanizing central part
of Carmel and primarily residential neighborhoods in East
Carmel; and
• Is buffered by long stretches of mature trees providing
aesthetic benefit.
The volume of traffic on Keystone Parkway has increased;
additionally, many intersecting streets have experienced
increasing volumes of traffic. The addition of traffic has
increased the time it takes to traverse the township. During
certain parts of the day, the corridor has backed-up traffic
and is noted by residents as being a transportation concern.

Critical Area Boundaries

The Keystone Parkway Corridor boundaries are depicted on
the Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Gain Control of the Right-of-Way: Through an agreement with
the State of Indiana the City of Carmel successfully gained
full control over Keystone Parkway, reverting it to a City
controlled street instead of a State Road.
Install Grade-Separated Roundabouts: Now that the City has
control of the right-of-way, it will achieve grade separation
at key intersections. The most logical design for grade
separation is a roundabout configuration to control the
turning movements of vehicles entering or exiting Keystone
Parkway. This design will require much less right-of-way
acquisition, thereby minimizing disturbance to adjacent
properties. The result will be significant reductions in traffic
congestion, travel times, and vehicular accidents. The flow
of traffic traveling north or south along Keystone will be
uninhibited by stop lights.
Assure East/West Connectivity: As a major arterial, Keystone
Parkway acts as a barrier for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
The City will install grade-separated bicycle and pedestrian
crossings to support east/west connectivity and improve
convenience and safety.
Preserve and Install Tree Canopy: Carmel will maintain the
overlay language in its zoning regulations to protect the
existing tree canopy. It will also require installation of
new canopy trees when appropriate to maintain the “green
corridor” aesthetic.

Install Multi-use Paths: There is an ever-increasing demand for
bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Carmel. The Keystone
Parkway Corridor will provide a tremendous opportunity
for Multi-use paths to be added within the existing rightof-way. With the Monon Greenway functioning at capacity
at times, the Keystone Parkway Corridor would provide
another north-south route for bicycles and pedestrians. With
a connection between the Monon Greenway at the north
(see Keystone Parkway Corridor Plan) and south, a highly
desirable circuit would be created.
Require Connection between Carmel Drive and Mohawk Drive: As
areas between Carmel Drive and Mohawk Drive develop and
redevelop, the City will require a strong street connection to
relieve use of Keystone Parkway. This requirement reflects
the existing and highly used connection (AAA Way) from
116th Street to Carmel Drive.

Design Guidelines

• Protect and enhance the green corridor aesthetic.
• Assure safe means for bicycles and pedestrians to cross
Keystone Parkway.
• Protect existing residential neighborhoods along Keystone
Parkway from conflicting land use encroachment.
• Use Keystone Parkway to soften the effects of
commercial development for residential neighborhoods.
• Add aesthetic character to grade-separated roundabouts so
they maintain a pleasant and context-sensitive corridor.
• Minimize and discourage unplanned expansion
of commercial uses in the corridor. Commercial
character should be buffered from nearby and adjacent
neighborhoods with appropriate landscaping, building
placement, etc.
• Plan for mass transit by encouraging mixed-use hubs with
appropriate residential densities.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
U.S. 31 CORRIDOR
Description

The U.S. 31 Corridor has been identified as a critical
corridor because it:
• Serves as major regional north/south arterial;
• Provides an abrupt transition between the urbanizing
central part of Carmel and sensitive low density
residential neighborhoods and estates;
• Creates an undesirable barrier for east/west vehicular,
bicycle, and pedestrian transit; and
• Is a major employment corridor and economic engine.
U.S. 31 is slated to be upgraded to freeway status, requiring
interchanges as the only access points. This is a positive
improvement to reduce traffic congestion, yet will result
in numerous challenges as well. For instance, Carmel will
likely lose some access points along the corridor.
It will be important for Carmel to maintain sufficient
access to U.S. 31 and to ensure the City’s character is not
compromised. Further, it will be important to provide
numerous means for east/west access for vehicles, bicycles,
and pedestrians.

Critical Area Boundaries

Maintain Strong East/West Connectivity: As a major arterial,
U.S. 31 acts as a barrier for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
When the highway is upgraded to freeway status, it may also
reduce east/west connectivity for vehicles. The City will
work with the State of Indiana to establish six interchanges
and three overpasses for adequate vehicular, bicycle, and
pedestrian access. Two additional bicycle and pedestrian
grade-separated crossings are necessary.
Require 6 to 10 Story Buildings: Require all buildings in the
employment corridor to be 6 to 10 stories in height, and
3 to 5 stories (not to exceed 60 feet) when between 106th
Street and 111th Street west of U.S. 31 (see illustration
below). However, building heights should be reduced as
they encroach on Illinois Street and Pennsylvania Street; and
building heights should not exceed 3 stories when adjacent
to existing residential neighborhoods (see illustration
below). This office and medical corridor provides essential
employment opportunity and portrays a positive community
character. Parking areas should be de-emphasized and, when
appropriate structured to make room for additional buildings.
Limited opportunity for business-serving and employeeserving commercial should be allowed (e.g. restaurants and
print shops) in existing buildings or small nodes along the
corridor.

Design Guidelines

The U.S. 31 Corridor boundaries are depicted on the
Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Utilize Roundabout Interchanges: The City of Carmel will work
with the State of Indiana to ensure the use of roundaboutstyle interchanges. These interchange designs are expected
to save cost, reduce acquisition of land, disturb less of the
built environment, and best match the character goals of the
City. Another expected advantage is efficiency of vehicular
traffic, reducing emissions and fuel consumption.
Extend Illinois Street from 106th to 111th Street: As U.S. 31 is
upgraded, Illinois Street will be necessary to provide north/
south access to the employment corridor on the west side of
U.S. 31. Illinois Street also establishes the transition from
intense office corridor to low density residential areas to the
west.

2 Story Home

• Protect and enhance the green corridor aesthetic created
by large lawns and consistent landscaping.
• Ensure safe means for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross
U.S. 31.
• Transition the scale and mass of structures between U.S.
31 and Illinois Street to minimize impact to residential
development to the west.
• Require high quality, urban office architecture and campus
design between Illinois Street and Pennsylvania Street.
• Prohibit “branded” architecture.
• Allow clearly visible signs for major tenants.
• Encourage “green” architecture for all new buildings.
• Sensitively integrate amenity nodes along Illinois Street
and Pennsylvania Street for convenience and enjoyment
of corridor employees and nearby residents.
• Prepare for a context sensitive mass transit line.
• Respect transitions to adjacent neighborhoods and require
appropriate buffering.
• Integrate bicycle and pedestrian facilities along U.S. 31
Corridor.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
96TH STREET CORRIDOR
Description

The 96th Street Corridor has been identified as a critical
corridor because it:
• Serves as a major east/west arterial;
• Establishes a division between stable residential
neighborhoods and commercial areas; and
• Traverses in and out of sensitive neighborhoods.
Through the early 1960’s, 96th Street was an uninterrupted
cross-county connector between the Boone County line
and the White River. In the mid-sixties, Interstate 465 was
constructed resulting in the current disrupted configuration
near Westfield Boulevard. As northern Marion County
and southern Hamilton County urbanized, 96th Street’s
importance as a major east/west corridor was rekindled.
Today, 96th Street continues to evolve into a major arterial,
especially east of Keystone Parkway. In the study area of
the 96th Street Corridor Plan, there are three segments that
reflect commercial character and correspondingly carry
higher volumes of traffic:
• Between Michigan Road and Shelbourne Road;
• Between Spring Mill Road and College Avenue; and
• Between Westfield Boulevard and Keystone Parkway.
There are also two segments that maintain residential
character and carry lower volumes of traffic:
• Between Shelbourne Road and Spring Mill Road; and
• Between College Avenue and Westfield Boulevard.

Critical Area Boundaries

The 96th Street Corridor boundaries are depicted on the
Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Encourage Redevelopment Along Michigan Road: The City of
Carmel should encourage the redevelopment of property on
the northeast corner of Michigan Road and 96th Street. A
high quality development at this location would enhance this
gateway into Carmel. It is hoped that a quality development
in this strategic location will act as a catalyst for similar
quality to the south, north, and east where several “tired” and
under-utilized buildings are located.
Buffer Residential Areas from Commercial: As commercial areas
near Michigan Road evolve or are redeveloped, special
attention should be given to transitions, or softening potential negative effects, to adjacent residential areas.

Enhance East/West Connectivity: Where 96th Street (the Real
Street leg) connects with Westfield Boulevard south of
I-465, the City of Carmel should look for ways to improve
connectivity to the new roundabout north of I-465 on
Westfield Boulevard. The best solution may be another
roundabout at Real Street (Marion County’s jurisdiction) at
Westfield Boulevard to allow for more fluid, uninterrupted
vehicle flow.
The above described enhancement is most likely the best
alternative when considering financial resources. However,
if the funding could be obtained, the City would prefer
a straight alignment over I-465, eliminating the need for
the Real Street segment (see Alternative Alignment on
the next page). Although this alignment would be more
costly, it would better enhance east/west connectivity, and
restore 96th Street to its original configuration prior to the
construction of I-465.
Connect Pennsylvania Parkway to Westfield Boulevard: This linkage would likely help relieve traffic on 96th Street between
College Avenue and Westfield Boulevard. The right-of-way
for this street extension exists in some locations north of
I-465. An alternate east/west connection is reestablishing
the original alignment of 96th Street by building a new
bridge over I-465.
Install Multi-use Paths: There is an ever-increasing demand
for bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Carmel. The 96th
Street Corridor provides an opportunity for Multi-use Paths
to be added between the Monon Greenway and Keystone
Parkway. With the Monon Greenway functioning at capacity at times, the 96th Street Corridor would provide (once
Multi-use Paths are installed on Keystone Parkway) a highly
desirable circuit.
Maintain Residential Character: In the residential areas noted
on the 96th Street Corridor Plan, the City should maintain
a 2-lane configuration with residential sensitivity (e.g.
minimize right-of-way impacts, and add street trees and
Multi-use Paths) for as long as possible. Based on the 96th
Street Corridor Study (1999), the 2-lane configuration would
result in congestion during some periods, but would be
manageable up to the year 2020.

Design Guidelines

• Protect and enhance residential character in the street
sections between Shelbourne Road and Spring Mill Road.
• Add Multi-use Paths, especially along the north side of
96th Street.
• Sensitively transition between commercial and residential
uses with vegetation, distance, screening, and buffering
land uses.

Because this corridor plan was completed in 1999, some influencing factors have changed.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
CITY CENTER/OLD TOWN SUBAREA
Description

The City Center and Old Town nodes have been identified as
a critical subarea because they:
• Collectively function as the City of Carmel’s core
downtown;
• Are going through substantial redevelopment; and
• Represent the City’s economic and cultural vitality.
Downtowns are special places, and Carmel’s is no exception.
Historically, the downtown functioned as the primary
location for commerce and pedestrian activity. Over time,
commercial development on the outskirts diverted much of
the vitality away from the downtown.
Carmel has recognized the importance of its downtown
and is redeveloping several parcels and encouraging
reinvestment. It is also striving to reintroduce many cultural
activities and capacity to the district.
Architectural character, bicycle and pedestrian amenities,
vitality anchors and connectivity will all be essential to its
success. The City recognizes that any modern downtown
must accommodate vehicles and will strive to include
parking areas in discrete locations.

Critical Area Boundaries

The City Center and Old Town boundaries are depicted on
the Orientation Map on the following page.

Strategy

Form-Based Regulatory Ordinance: The City of Carmel will draft
and adopt a form-based code to regulate massing, scale,
intensity, building orientation and site features required for
new or redevelopment projects in the core. This form-based
regulation should be accompanied by a detailed plan for the
entire subarea.
The form-based code will replace the traditional zoning
ordinance, and will not focus heavily on regulating land use.

88

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Enhance Connectivity: The historic grid system of local streets
was not expanded as growth occurred in the downtown.
Various developments over the years have become obstacles
for proper connectivity in the downtown. As the district
continues to be redeveloped and additional vehicular, bicycle
and pedestrian traffic is realized, the need for additional
connectivity will grow significantly. For this reason, the
City will seek opportunities to expand the grid or to make
new connections, especially with local streets.
Another essential connection is with the Monon Greenway.
The map on the opposite page demonstrates several potential
linkages the City intends to install.
Assure a Bicycle and Pedestrian-Friendly Environment: Downtowns
should be places where people feel comfortable and have
a desire to be. Beyond the obvious need for bicycle and
pedestrian amenities like benches, bicycle racks, interesting
paving material, safe street crossings, and pedestrian-scale
street lights, there are many other factors that make a person
interested in being downtown. The most notable are the
pedestrian interaction and street vitality.
Restaurants with outdoor seating, retail storefronts with
large windows, pocket parks or plazas, and other pedestrianoriented destinations are all essential. Ground floor offices,
some service businesses, and surface parking along the street
edge often distract from the pedestrian environment and will
be discouraged.
Signature Buildings: Carmel will work to achieve the construction of “signature” buildings at key locations in Old
Town and City Center. These building sites are intended to
establish character precedent for the district and to act as a
catalyst for reinvestment and redevelopment. The proposed
building sites for signature buildings are also prominent
locations where a powerful architectural statement will have
a positive impression on visitors. See the following illustration for proposed and existing signature building sites.

Design Guidelines

• Ensure safe environment for bicycles and pedestrians,
especially at road and driveway crossings. A change in
paving material is a preferred method to signal to drivers
that they are in a pedestrian environment.
• Require ground floor elevations to have large transparent
windows for inside/outside interaction.
• Require dedication of right-of-way for the expansion of
the grid system of local streets.
• Encourage upper story residential or employment uses to
support pedestrian vitality at the street level.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
OLD MERIDIAN SUBAREA
Description

The Old Meridian Subarea has been identified as a critical
district because it:
• Is experiencing increased development pressure;
• Has a wide mix of land uses coming together in a small
area;
• Has a significant portion of the land left undeveloped or
underdeveloped;
• Is made up of a few permanent uses (e.g. Street Vincent’s
Carmel Hospital and Carmel Middle School) which
require some sensitivity;
• Has a significant demand for businesses to serve the
corporate corridor along U.S. 31; and
• Lacks a cohesive theme and unifying features.
The City of Carmel conducted a thorough market study of
the Old Meridian Subarea followed by a detailed physical
study (Old Meridian Task Force Report). The result of both
efforts was a vision, physical development plan, and land
use concept for the district.
The City has already improved Old Meridian Street into a
four-lane boulevard with roundabouts at critical locations.
The street improvements include a new landscaped median,
curbs, and sidewalks.

Critical Area Boundaries

The Old Meridian Subarea boundaries are depicted on the
Orientation Map on page 96.

Strategy

Old Meridian Street Boulevard: The City of Carmel upgraded
Old Meridian Street into a boulevard with roundabouts at
Pennsylvania Street, Grand Boulevard and Main Street. This
project sets the character for the district, enhances bicycle
and pedestrian access, and mitigates traffic.
Grand Boulevard and other Radial Boulevards: The City will build
Grand Boulevard and other secondary boulevards in the
locations depicted on the Old Meridian Subarea Plan. These
radial boulevards will offer park-like medians to support
bicycling and walking access to the Village area. They will
also provide cross-circulation for vehicles and high quality
settings for new development.

Townhouse and Multiple-family Uses: The Old Meridian Subarea
Plan envisions both upscale and more moderate units within
townhouses and multiple-family developments. These
residential developments are intended to be located along the
new boulevards.
Office Development: Outside the central retail and residential
areas, new office development is anticipated on the south
end of the subarea. This office development is intended to
be two to five stories, mostly fronting on Old Meridian Street.
Mixed Medical Development: The area north of Main Street
and south of St. Vincent’s Carmel Hospital is intended to
facilitate the development, expansion, and modernization of
a major hospital complex or campus. It is also intended to
include mixed uses that will support such a campus, including retail, restaurants, services, rehabilitation, and fitness
facilities.
Mixed-Use Village: The Old Meridian Village is intended to
be a concentrated mixed-use development with upper-floor
residential units. The Village will be a walkable atmosphere
and will offer cafes and entertainment for residents and
employees of nearby developments. Establishing a critical
mass of retail uses is essential.
District Character: The City of Carmel will encourage an urban
character similar to an old-fashioned village or Main Street.
Buildings will primarily be designed to front on boulevards
or secondary streets with vehicles de-emphasized by requiring parking in the rear of properties. Ground floor elevations
will generally be transparent glass, and buildings will have
distinct elevations with cornice lines with three-dimensional
details.

Single-Family Attached Design Guidelines

• Residential units should provide a minimum of two offstreet parking spaces, or one if on-street parking is ample.
• Off-street parking should be on a paved driveway or in an
attached or detached enclosed garage.
• All parking should be accessed from the rear of the unit.
• All buildings should face a public street.

Secondary Street Network: As development occurs, secondary streets will need to be installed as depicted on the
Old Meridian Subarea Plan. These streets are intended to
provide additional connectivity instead of dead-end driveways serving a single development. They also provide an
opportunity for buildings to face public streets with parking
in the rear of the property.
Large single-family homes with brick fronts, small yards, and
stoops are a good fit for the Single-family Attached subdistrict.
90

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
• Developments exceeding ten units should provide 15% of
the land area as open space, landscaped for enjoyment by
the residents.
• All local streets should accommodate on-street parking
and sidewalks according to Old Meridian Subarea Plan.
• All units should be vertically separated, between 25 to 35
feet in width, and two and one-half stories tall.
• Front facades should be clad in brick with threedimensional details.
• Front doors should face the street and be two to five feet
above sidewalk level.
• An articulated cornice should be provided where the top
of the facade meets the roof.
• If desired, a “transparent” fence (e.g. wrought iron)
should be allowed in the front yard.

• Freestanding signs should be prohibited. All
identification, directional, or informational signs should
be small and located on the building or integrated onto a
fence.

Multiple-Family Attached Design Guidelines

• All units should provide a minimum of two off-street
parking spaces, or one if on-street parking is ample.
• Surface parking or parking garages should not be adjacent
to or face a public street.
• At least 75% of all buildings in a development should
face a public street.
• Developments exceeding ten units should provide 15% of
the land area as open space, landscaped for enjoyment by
the residents.

Row homes are a suitable fit for the Single-family Attached
subdistrict.

• Buildings facing public streets should have a build-to
requirement, with facades being varied between four and
nine feet from the right-of-way. Off-street parking or
driveways should not be permitted in the front setback.
• All local streets should accommodate on-street parking
and sidewalks according to the Old Meridian Subarea
Plan.
• Buildings should be a minimum of 28 feet tall and a
maximum of 55 feet tall, except parking garages which
cannot exceed 35 feet in height.
• All units should be accessible from both the front and
back of the building.
• Front setbacks and courtyards should be finished with
sidewalks and extensive landscaping.
• Use of balconies in the structure’s design.
• Courtyards may be fenced with wrought iron or metal
fences that are no more than five feet tall.

Multiple-family Attached development should face the street and
have on-street parking to accommodate visitors.

Mixed-Use Village Design Guidelines

• All ground floors should be retail, restaurant, or
entertainment uses except for lobby or transitional areas
to upper-floor residential units.
• Upper floors may be residential, office, or commercial
uses.
• Drive-through facilities should be prohibited.
• Parking should be provided at a one per 800 square feet
ratio of gross area in the building.
• Parking should be on-site or within 200 feet of the site
and shared parking will be considered; on-street parking
is encouraged but is excluded from calculations of
required spaces.
• All buildings should face the public street and at least one
main entrance to each ground floor use shall be on the
street side of the building.
• Curb cuts or parking lots should not be allowed on Old
Meridian Street.
• The buildings should sit on the front property line, except
for minor recessed areas (e.g. entrances).
• Pedestrian access to rear parking areas is encouraged and
should be at least eight feet wide.
• No single retail business should have more than 45 feet of
frontage on Old Meridian Street.
• Buildings must be a minimum of two stories and a
maximum of four stories, except parking garages which
should not exceed three stories.
• Ground floor elevations should be a minimum of 80%
transparent glass.
• Buildings should have a distinct cornice line at the top of
the wall and have intermediate horizontal elements.
• The general proportion of the building should be vertical.
• The primary articulation of the building should be threedimensional details rather than massing.
• In general, roofs should be flat or slightly sloped.
• Ground floor tenants should be allowed one and one-half
square feet of sign area per lineal foot of building frontage
with a maximum of 32 square feet of sign area.
CARMEL CLAY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

91

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
• Building signs should fit within the horizontal and vertical
elements of the building and should not obscure the
building’s architectural details.
• Signs should be mounted perpendicular to the facade
(blade signs) or flat-mounted on the facade.
• Signs should not extend above the height of the building,
but they can be on awnings or painted in storefront
windows or upper-floor windows. Signs on umbrellas or
other product branding should be restricted.
• Retractable fabric awnings may be used, but cannot
exceed the width of the windows or cover architectural
details of the building.
• Individual tenants should strive for a unique graphic
identity rather than be required to conform to a single
standard.

Outdoor seating provides street vitality in Mixed-use Village areas.

Village Office Design Guidelines

• Primary uses should be office related.
• A small percentage of floor area may be dedicated to
small retail or restaurant uses.
• Drive-through facilities should be prohibited.
• Parking should be provided at a one per 600 square feet
ratio of leasable area.
• All buildings should face the public street and at least one
main entrance to each ground floor use should be on the
street side of the building.
• Curb cuts or parking lots should not be allowed along Old
Meridian Street.
• Buildings should be at least two stories, but no more than
five stories in height.
• The maximum footprint of any single building should
be 15,000 square feet and a minimum of 8,000 square
feet.
• Buildings facing public streets shall have a build-to
requirement, with facades being varied between 20 feet
and 30 feet from the right-of-way. No off-street parking
or driveways are permitted in the front setback.
• Buildings should be faced in brick, trimmed in metal,
stone, precast concrete, wood, or stucco. Large expanses
of glass should be permitted, but the structure should
not be predominantly glass and metal (e.g. curtain wall
construction). Concrete block should not be permitted.
• A single freestanding monument sign should be permitted
in the front setback and be thoroughly landscaped around
the base.
• An additional, appropriately scaled, wall sign should also
be permitted, as per the City’s ordinances.

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
Mixed Medical Design Guidelines

• Primary uses should be inpatient and outpatient care
facilities, medical offices, rehabilitation, physical fitness,
long-term care, and related uses and support services.
• Up to 15% of the gross floor area may be dedicated to
retail or restaurant uses that support the aforementioned
uses.
• Drive-through facilities should be prohibited.
• Parking should be determined on a case-by-case basis due
to the uniqueness of these land uses.
• All buildings should face the public street and at least one
main entrance to each ground floor use should be on the
street side of the building.
• Curb cuts or parking lots should not be allowed along Old
Meridian Street.
• Buildings should be at least two stories, but no more than
five stories in height; except hospitals which may be 10
stories.
• The minimum footprint of any single building should
be 8,000 square feet and a general maximum of 20,000
square feet, excluding a hospital.
• Buildings facing public streets shall have a build-to
requirement, with facades being varied between 20 feet
and 30 feet from the right-of-way. No off-street parking
or driveways are permitted in the front setback.
• Buildings should be faced in brick, trimmed in metal,
stone, precast concrete, wood, or stucco. Large expanses
of glass should be permitted, but the structure should
not be predominantly glass and metal (e.g. curtain wall
construction). Concrete block should not be permitted.
• Facades that are wider than 50 feet shall have offsets
which divide the facade into meaningful sections such as
tenant spaces or entryways.
• Wall or ground signs should also be permitted, as per the
City’s ordinances.

Special Use Design Guidelines

• Primary uses should be public institutions (e.g. places of
worship or civic buildings).
• Commercial or office uses would also be fitting if the
architecture is iconic and contributes to the overall profile
of the corridor.
• Parking should be in line with other subdistricts, but will
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
• Buildings should be oriented to face the roundabout and
be set back 150 feet from the right-of-way.
• Buildings should have at least a 10,000 square foot
building footprint.
• Buildings should be at least three stories, but no
more than five stories, with the exception of certain
architectural elements such as steeples, towers, etc.
• Buildings should be constructed of substantial materials
consistent with an iconic and lasting structure.
• Substantial and attractive landscaping should be installed
in the setback facing the roundabout.

Buildings can be excellent focal points and landmarks at key
locations.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
HOME PLACE SUBAREA
Description

Home Place has been identified as a critical subarea because it:
• Is notably impacted by the evolution of the U.S. 31 and
I-465 corridors; and
• Is experiencing redevelopment pressure.
Home Place is particularly important because it is
recognized as a town-like enclave. Although it was never
incorporated as a town or city, many residents in the area,
especially long-time residents, desire to maintain Home
Place’s autonomy and identity.
Over recent years, Home Place has been under increasing
redevelopment pressure. Sites along I-465 have been
purchased and redeveloped into office uses; and other sites
like the Sunrise Golf Club are under increasing pressure to
redevelop.
The Home Place Subarea is inclusive of Central Park, which
will be one of the largest public parks in Carmel. This
substantial investment will be a nice amenity for Home
Place residents. It will likely also raise property values and
desirability of the district.

Critical Area Boundaries

The Home Place boundaries are depicted on the Orientation
Map on the following page.

Strategy

Connection between Pennsylvania Parkway and 96th Street: The
City of Carmel will work to connect Pennsylvania Parkway
to the new roundabout at 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard. This connection is considered an essential connection,
especially as U.S. 31 is upgraded to a freeway configuration.
A grade separated crossing with the Monon Greenway will
be necessary. Multi-use paths will also be essential along
the new street to provide access to the Monon Greenway and
other destinations.
Promote a Neighborhood-Serving Commercial District: At the core
of Home Place (College Avenue and 106th Street) is a commercial district that historically has been home to a grocery
store, gas stations, offices, institutional uses, and miscellaneous retail uses. The current uses do not function well as
neighborhood-serving commercial and are not as bicycle- or
pedestrian-friendly as they once were. The City of Carmel
will work to encourage more mixed-use development that
provides a more bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly environment and that provides goods and services to the residential
community within walking distance.

96

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

Soften Transitions: As the U.S. 31 and I-465 develops with
higher intensity uses, the Home Place residential community
should be buffered through the use of transitional office
uses. These transitional areas should have structures that are
two or three stories in height and have roof designs that are
similar to residential developments. Further, parking areas
should be located away from residences and lighting should
be designed to not trespass into residential areas.

Design Guidelines

• Establish regulations to assure smooth transitions between
high intensity office areas and residential areas.
• Ensure development and redevelopment of the Home
Place core is comfortable and safe for bicycle and
pedestrians.
• Require buildings in the core to be built to the front
property line, have ground floor retail or office uses, and
have large transparent windows at ground level.
• Encourage upper story residential or employment uses in
the mixed-use core to support pedestrian vitality at the
street level.
• Protect the lake and woodland west of the Monon
Greenway and north of I-465 and encourage the use of the
land as a park.
• Install grade-separated crossings where the Monon
Greenway intersects with major roadways.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
96TH STREET AND WESTFIELD
BOULEVARD SUBAREA
Description

The 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard area has been
identified as a critical subarea because it:
• Is surrounded on three sides by major corridors: Westfield
Boulevard, 96th Street, and Keystone Parkway;
• Has stable neighborhoods that have been impacted by the
evolution of transportation facilities;
• Will likely be impacted by office/commercial
development of the land south of 96th Street controlled by
Indianapolis;
• Periodically experiences redevelopment pressure from the
private sector;
• Has areas that are not well drained; and
• Has limited bicycle and pedestrian connections to
regional amenities.
In recent years a new roundabout at 96th Street and Westfield
Boulevard was installed, a residential redevelopment project
was approved at 99th Street and Westfield Boulevard, and
the City of Carmel began reconstructing Keystone Parkway
into a grade-separated corridor.
In upcoming years, I-465 is planned to be reconstructed,
including the interchange with Keystone Parkway. The
intersection of Keystone Parkway and 96th Street is being
planned for grade separation and the Westfield Boulevard
bridge over I-465 is slated to be reconstructed. Also, 96th
Street is expected to be widened into a Primary Arterial
Street between Keystone Parkway and Haverstick Road,
and to a Parkway Arterial Street between Haverstick
Road and Westfield Boulevard. Therefore, in the future,
96th Street will be configured with a green median from
Haverstick Road to Westfield Boulevard; potentially with
one “intersection” in that segment for the undeveloped land
south of the corridor to have access to 96th Street.

Critical Area Boundaries

The 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard boundaries are
depicted on the Orientation Map on page 101.

Strategy

Connection between Pennsylvania Parkway and 96th Street: The
City of Carmel will work to connect Pennsylvania Parkway
to the roundabout at 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard.
This connection is considered an essential connection,
especially as U.S. 31 is upgraded to a freeway configuration.
Install Multi-Use Paths: There is an ever-increasing demand
for bicycle and pedestrian facilities in Carmel. Multi-use
paths along the west side of Keystone Parkway, the north
and south sides of 99th Street, the north and south sides
of 96th Street, and extensions of existing Multi-use paths
along Westfield Boulevard to the north and south are critical
pieces to add connectivity to the region; and especially for
98

CITY OF CARMEL, INDIANA

recreation. Along 99th Street, a sidewalk is preferred on the
south side because it has a narrower width and greater design
flexibility to avoid and preserve mature trees.
Multi-use paths connecting the Chesterton Neighborhood
to Westfield Boulevard and Maple Drive from 99th to 96th
Streets will add important connections. Also, a Multi-use
path along the east side of Haverstick Road will enhance
pedestrian safety and provide another vital pedestrian link
north and south.
Mitigate Light Trespass and Glare: Strictly regulate on-site
lighting of any new development adjacent to stable neighborhoods to prevent light trespass and glare.
Preserve and Install Tree Canopy: The 96th Street and Westfield
Boulevard Subarea has a significant and well established
tree canopy. The character of this subarea is anchored by the
presence of many mature trees. Carmel will utilize its zoning regulations and processes to reasonably protect existing
tree canopy in the subarea. It will also require installation
of new canopy trees along public streets including Keystone
Parkway, when appropriate, to maintain the “green corridor”
aesthetic which exists in areas north along Keystone Parkway.
Soften Impacts from Major Corridors: As the 96th Street, Westfield
Boulevard, and Keystone Parkway corridors evolve, attention should be given to soften impacts to adjacent residential
areas from future increases in traffic, widening of roads, and
new turning limitations at intersections. Specifically, future
roadway improvements should be context sensitive in their
design and improve the ability for residents and businesses to
gain access to the major corridors during peak hours.
Buffer Stable Neighborhoods from Redevelopment: Require permanent and effective buffering to be installed between stable
neighborhoods and areas that redevelop. Trees, landscaping,
decorative masonry walls (i.e. brick or stone, not wood), and
earthen berms should be considered, but the preservation
of residential dwellings within stable areas should also be a
factor.
Protect 99th Street and Haverstick Road as Residential-Character
Collector Streets: Assure that 99th Street and Haverstick Road
remain collector streets with residential character. Aside
from pedestrian facilities along Haverstick Road and 99th
Street, these streets generally remain the same.
Stabilize Hamilton Heights and Forest Glen Subdivisions: As
residential properties in close proximity to 96th Street redevelop, sever Kittrell Drive, Lincoln Boulevard, and Maple
Drive and terminate each in a cul-de-sac at the expense
of the commercial redevelopment. Also, link 98th Street
between Kittrell Drive and Lincoln Boulevard to allow
properties along Lincoln Boulevard and Maple Drive to have
access to Westfield Boulevard. This change would result in
the remaining homes being located on local streets and an
increased degree of neighborhood stability.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
Add Street Lights and Sidewalks: Because much of this
subarea was platted prior to subdivision regulations that
required proper infrastructure, many of the neighborhoods
do not have sufficient sidewalks, street lighting, or drainage facilities. The City of Carmel will utilize its existing
programs for public and private investment in such public
infrastructure.

Transition Area: The area designated as “Transition” on
the 96th Street and Westfield Boulevard Subarea Map,
on page 103, may be utilized for non-building features
associated with commercial redevelopment (e.g. storm water
management or parking), or may be used for medium to
high density single-family dwellings; either of which would
still necessitate buffering to minimize impacts to stable
neighborhoods as described herein.

Improve Surface Drainage: As new development has occurred
in the region, and as roads have been improved, local
residents believe issues with storm water have gotten worse.
The City should continue to study and help resolve these
drainage issues, thus helping to reduce basement flooding
and similar problems that can destabilize neighborhoods.

Growth Management: Redevelopment along 96th Street should
only be permitted when it is contiguous to existing commercial uses and when lots have been assembled into large
enough parcels for the commercial development to be master
planned with organized parking areas, linkages between
parking areas, effective buffers, landscaping and pedestrian
facilities.

Connect Maple Street to 99th Street: As a part of a recent
approval for a residential PUD, the developer committed to
extending Maple Street from 98th Street to 99th Street. This
link is considered important for emergency services to gain
access to residential structures from multiple directions.

Utilize Transitional Land Uses and Form to Soften Impacts of
Potentially Large-scale Office Development South of 96th Street: As
the area south of 96th Street evolves into office and commercial centers (Indianapolis’ jurisdiction), transitional uses and
smaller scale buildings should be used along the north side
of 96th Street to buffer stable neighborhoods to the north.
Similar to landscaping, moderate intensity land uses can
also be used for buffering. These buffering land uses would
be limited to one to two stories in height and would be
required to utilize facades and roof designs that are similar
to or complementary with residential development (e.g.
brick facades, pitched roofs, and dormers). Further, heavily
landscaped parking areas should be required.

Allow Employment Centers along 96th Street: Allow private
sector driven redevelopment (i.e. private negotiation and
willingness to sell) along the north side of the 96th Street
corridor between Keystone Parkway and Westfield Boulevard. Redevelopment projects should result in employment
centers (e.g. general office, medical office, or service business). Neighborhood serving commercial (e.g. small scale
dry cleaners, cafe, or convenience store) will be considered
if it fits the context. Generally, the footprint of new buildings associated with redevelopment should be limited to the
areas shown on the map and labeled “1 to 2 Story Employment Center” on page 101. See the conceptual cross section
drawings below.

PART 5: CRITICAL CORRIDORS AND SUBAREAS
Reduce Curb Cuts along 96th Street: As areas along 96th Street
redevelop, require significant reduction in the number
of curb cuts. Also control where development south of
96th Street gains access to 96th Street. Street access from
the north and south should align with one another when
possible.
Maintain Westfield Boulevard as a Residential Corridor: Westfield
Boulevard between 96th Street and 99th Street will be
maintained as a residential corridor. The City of Carmel will
consider redevelopment along the east side of the corridor
when proposals are for high density single-family detached
dwellings or moderate density townhouses or apartments
that complement the area. Specifically, the cluster of properties on the southeast corner of 99th Street and Westfield
Boulevard and the properties between Kittrell and Westfield
Boulevard would be areas for redevelopment consideration.

Two-story office structures, like the one pictured above, would be
fitting along 96th Street between Haverstick Road and Westfield
Boulevard.

Design Guidelines

• Protect and enhance existing tree canopy.
• Establish safe means for bicyclists and pedestrians to
travel outside of and around the subarea, especially
to 116th Street, Central Park, Marion County, and
employment centers to the west.
• Protect existing residential neighborhoods from light
pollution by strictly requiring cut-off light fixtures and
other lighting standard.
• Evaluate the most effective and beneficial buffering
system to mitigate potential impacts to stable
neighborhoods on a case-by-case basis. Utilize buffering
systems that are aesthetically pleasing, comforting, and
natural in character. Also consider buffer designs that do
not consume large areas which necessitate the demolition
of additional residential structures.
• When redevelopment occurs, require small-scale office
buildings which complement the building mass of
residential properties. Require new office buildings to be
constructed in close proximity to the right of way with
parking areas predominantly in the side and rear yards.
• If neighborhood serving commercial development is
allowed, it should be designed carefully to fit the local
character and should have pedestrian connectivity to the
neighborhoods.

Parking should be primarily located in side yards or rear yards
and the buildings should be pulled forward toward the street. Also,
pedestrian facilities should be installed along the frontage.

High quality townhouses would be appropriate residential
redevelopment along Westfield Boulevard.

A limited amount of small-scale, neighborhood serving commercial
may be appropriate when supported by local residents.
