Crossings

SW10.01 Purpose
The primary function of a roadway is for safe movement of traffic. When a
drainage structure crosses a roadway or railroad (railroads are treated as
roadways in this section), design of the crossing shall comply with the
standards and specifications of the agency having jurisdiction over the
roadway. Design should consider the structural integrity of the roadway and
safe movement of traffic in addition to hydraulic capacity of the structure.

SW10.02 General Design Considerations
1.

Jurisdictional Agencies
Design of drainage structures which cross a roadway shall comply with
the standards and specifications of the agency having jurisdiction over
the roadway.

2.

Hydraulic Capacity
Drainage structures crossing roadways shall be designed with sufficient
hydraulic capacity to prevent runoff water from a 100-year event from
over topping the roadway.

3.

Minimum Pipe Diameter
The minimum diameter of a storm sewer crossing a public roadway shall
be 12 inches.
The minimum diameter of a culvert crossing a public roadway shall be
15 inches.

4.

Structural Design
Drainage structures crossing a public roadway shall be designed to carry
an AASHTO HS-20-44 design load. Structures crossing a railroad shall be
designed to carry an E80 design load.
Drainage structure installation depths shall comply with the minimum
and maximum cover height for the type of structure installed.
Structures shall have a minimum depth of cover of 3 feet.

5.

Skew Angle
The drainage structure crossing angle or skew shall not exceed 45
degrees measured from a line perpendicular to the roadway.

6.

Culvert Length
The length of a culvert with end treatment for a roadway crossing shall
fit the existing or design roadway front slopes. End treatment shall, as
much as practical, be flush with the slope and not cause the roadway
front slope to vary from the typical section.

SW10.03 Roadway Crossing Design
1.

Hydraulic Design
Refer to Chapter SW5 - Hydrology and Chapter SW9 - Culverts for
hydraulic design of roadway crossing culverts.

SW10.04 Length Design
1.

General
Culvert length shall be designed to fit existing or design roadway front
slopes. Roadway safety shall be considered for culvert replacement
projects where roadway shoulders are narrow and front slopes are
steep. Consideration should be given to widening shoulders and
flattening slopes where right of way width permits.

2.

Regulated Drain Crossings
A culvert in a regulated drain crossing a roadway may extend beyond
road right of way into the drainage easement. The additional culvert
length provides an opportunity for roadway safety improvements at an
open channel crossing. Additional right of way may be acquired if the
culvert is in a non-regulated drain which is not in a drainage easement.

3.

Length Calculations for Perpendicular Crossing of Roadways or Railroads
LP = Sd (left) + W + Sd (right)
LP = Total crossing length
Sd = Slope distance between shoulder break and end of culvert or end
treatment.
Sd = H X S
H = Height from shoulder break elevation to culvert or end
treatment invert elevation.
S = Rise/Run (eg. 3:1 slope = 3/1 = 3)
Note: 1. When end treatment is not used, Sd is determined at the
point of intersection between the front slope and culvert
invert.
2. When end treatment is used, Sd is determined at the point
of intersection between the front slope and end treatment
invert.
3. When end treatment is used, end treatment length must be
subtracted from Total Crossing Length to determine Culvert
Length.
W = Distance between left and right shoulder breaks.

Length Calculations for Skewed Crossing of Roadways or Railroads
LS = LP / cos(a)
a = angle of skew measured left or right from a line
perpendicular to the road centerline.

SW10.05 Roadway Safety
1.

Clear Zone
The designer shall comply with clear zone requirements of the agency
having jurisdiction over the roadway.

2.

Guardrail and Handrail
A guardrail or handrail may be required if a drainage structure, which
crosses a roadway, creates a situation hazardous to traffic. The
guardrail or handrail shall comply with the standards and specifications
of the public agency having jurisdiction over the roadway or trail.

SW10.06 Construction
1.

Traffic Control
Drainage structure crossing installation may require traffic control
measures.
Permitting for construction signage or a road closure and establishment
of a detour route must be obtained from the public agency having
jurisdiction over the roadway.

2.

Open Trench Installation / Jacking and Boring
Permitting, traffic control, pavement removal, excavation, culvert
material, bedding, backfill, pavement patching and restoration and
seeding shall comply with the standards and specifications of the public
agency having jurisdiction over the roadway. City Utilities’ standards
and specifications for structure material, bedding and backfill are
required if more restrictive than the roadway agency standards and
specifications.

SW10.07 Permitting
Roadway crossing construction may require approval and/or permitting from
the agency having jurisdiction over the roadway. Each public agency may
have design criteria which must be complied with for permitting.
1.

Private Agencies
Private agencies include railroad companies.

Public Agencies
 City of Fort Wayne Street Engineering Department for work
within City street or road right of way.
 Indiana Department of Transportation, Fort Wayne District for
work within State, Federal, or Interstate Highway rights of way.
 Allen County Highway Department for work within County road
right of way.
 Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation Department for work
affecting the River Greenway or trail and bicycle system.

Early coordination for projects affecting stream channels
or wetlands.
Stream crossings.
Work within a floodway or flood plain.
All culverts and bridges, public or private, with a drainage
area equal to or greater than 1 square mile.

Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) for
Early Coordination for projects affecting stream channels,
including regulated drains.
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for Early
Coordination for projects affecting wetlands or stream channels
including regulated drains.

After Early Coordination is submitted to IDNR, IDEM and USACE (It is
advisable to copy affected local public agencies) a field check is
scheduled. The field check will determine which agency/agencies have
jurisdiction and what permitting will be required.
