NEWS RELEASE
Mayor Dick Moore announced the City has received final loan approval and closed on the
State Revolving Fund (SRF) bonds for the CSO 6&7 Tank Project. The SRF bond is a State of
Indiana funding source providing low interest loans to communities. Because of the low interest
loan the City will save $5,000,000 in interest payments over the life of the loan.
The $7,000,000 project will be consist of construction of a one million gallon
underground storage tank to hold a mixture of raw sewage and stormwater during rain events
thus preventing raw sewage from entering the Elkhart River. When completed, the project will
eliminate 8 million gallons of raw sewage from entering the Elkhart River every year.
Grand River Construction won the bid for this project and has experience with large
projects in the City of Elkhart. GRC was the contractor who built the CSO 14 High Dive Park
underground storage tanks in 2011. GRC received notice of award on June 28th and has begun
their preparations for the project. As part of the preparation they have provided a construction
schedule. In projects such as this the schedule and completions of individual tasks can vary
from month to month depending on weather and other unforeseen complications. We have
merged the early action items from the GRC schedule into the following anticipated time line for
the next four months.
July 14, 2014 Preconstruction Meeting
July 21, 2014 GRC will begin modifications and striping for temporary parking areas. In
addition GRC will begin bringing personnel to the site in anticipation of a full
mobilization starting the 28th.

July 25, 2014 11:00 Ground Breaking at Burton upon Trent Park
July 28, 2014 GRC will close the Gause lot, start bringing in larger equipment, begin
work on the Lexington Ave. water main, and complete temporary parking striping on
Waterfall.
August 27, 2014 Contractual limit for Lexington closure
August 28, 2014 Close Jackson Blvd, remove pavement complete structure and piping
under roadway and restore roadway
October 10, 2014 Contractual limit for Jackson Blvd closure
The City and the Contractor are committed to moving as quickly as is prudent to
complete the work outlined above safely and correctly. In some cases the closings may be
shorter and the rest of the schedule may move up. The City will provide weekly updates if any
changes occur. More information about this project and updates may be found on the City
website at www.elkhartindiana.org/projects. Updates will also be provided via Twitter at
https://twitter.com/ElkhartPubWorks. Downtown Elkhart, Inc. will also be providing
information on their website at http://www.downtownelkhart.org.

Most Auburn citizens understand the value of the construction going on in our
city. While it can be an annoyance to have traffic delays or closed streets,
everyone I talk to agrees the work will be a real asset to our city for many
decades to come. What people may not understand is why there [&hellip;]

Next month, Auburn Electric will begin to upgrade its current electric meters
with automated ‚Äúsmart‚Äù meters capable of transmitting robust usage data.
Because these smart meters are networked to the electric utility, they combine
to create Automated Meter Infrastructure (AMI) that allows us to understand
power consumption in real-time so that we can distribute power [&hellip;]

Home &gt; SOUTH BEND FIRE SPONSORS CAMP FOR AREA GIRL SCOUTS
===============================================================================
***** SOUTH_BEND_FIRE_SPONSORS_CAMP_FOR_AREA_GIRL_SCOUTS [1] *****

The South Bend Fire Department will sponsor ‚ÄúCamp All In, Girls Fire Camp‚Äù
where they will introduce area Girl Scouts to firefighting and emergency
medical services from 5pm Friday, July 24 to 5pm Saturday, July 25 at the
city‚Äôs Luther J. Taylor Fire Training Center, 710 E. Sample Street.
Twenty Girl Scouts, between the ages of 6 and 8, will participate in this
first-time community outreach program. The camp provides insight into this
male-dominated profession, and is designed to teach the value of working with
others to achieve common goals and objectives.
The girls will learn how to initiate the 911 system in an emergency, how to put
together aid kits and tend to someone in need, how to deploy a fire hose and
extinguish a fire. They will also participate in fire and storm drills.¬ 
‚ÄúWe hope this event empowers girls and shows them that firefighting is a
possible career,‚Äù says Fire Chief Steve Cox. ‚ÄúNationally only three percent
of firefighters are women. Here in South Bend we‚Äôd like to have more females
on the force, and consider this camp a good introduction to the profession.‚Äù

Home &gt; NEW OWNER FOR NEW ENERGY PLANT
===============================================================================
***** NEW_OWNER_FOR_NEW_ENERGY_PLANT [1] *****

The City of South Bend has announced a new owner for the former New Energy
plant. Noble Americas South Bend Ethanol LLC (NASBE) has purchased the plant
and plans to restart it in late 2013 or early 2014.
The 70-acre facility is expected to employ 50. The facility is Indiana‚Äôs
longest running ethanol plant. New Energy began operating the facility in the
mid-1980s.
‚ÄúWe are pleased that this firm has chosen South Bend as the right place to
make this investment,‚Äù Mayor Pete Buttigieg says. ‚ÄúThroughout this process,
we have wanted to see this plant operated, not liquidated, employing residents
in the new economy.‚Äù
NASBE is a subsidiary of Noble Americas Corp (NAC) which is an energy marketing
and trading company headquartered in Stamford, Conn. with large offices also in
Calgary and Houston. NASBE and NAC are indirectly, wholly owned subsidiaries of
the Noble Group Ltd. (NGL). NGL, founded in 1987, specializes in commodity
supply chain management services for the agricultural, petroleum products/crude
oil, industrial metals/coal, logistics and shipping, and energy sectors. Its
energy trading business is focused on arbitrage trading and asset management in
the natural gas and power sectors.¬ 
‚ÄúThis acquisition will help complement Noble‚Äôs existing ethanol business in
the United States.¬  The idea is to organically grow this into a major physical
ethanol business,‚Äù says William Cronin, president of NASBE.¬
