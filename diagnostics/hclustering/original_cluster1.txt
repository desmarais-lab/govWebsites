COMMUNITY AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
The Community Affairs Committee of the City-County Council met on Wednesday, April
14, 2010. Chair Christine Scales called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m. with the following
members present: Susie Day, Aaron Freeman, Maggie Lewis, Doris Minton-McNeill and
Marilyn Pfisterer. Absent was Paul Bateman.
PROPOSAL NO. 371, 2009 - amends the Code with respect to nonsmoking areas
Chair Scales stated that the sponsors of this proposal and others have been in
conversation, but are not ready to move the proposal forward at this point. Chair Scales
stated that to allow more time for discussion and allow it to stay on the docket to be heard
in the future, she would like to entertain a motion to table.
Councillor Pfisterer moved, seconded by Councillor Freeman, to “Table” Proposal No. 371,
2009. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Presentation on the Marion County Fair Board
Ron Phillips, President
Dick Switzer, Board Member
Bill Dowden, Board Member
Mr. Phillips stated that the Marion County Fair started 80 years ago in downtown
Wannamaker that was then called New Bethel. He said that the fair sits on 120 acres that
were acquired in the 1950’s. Mr. Phillips stated that they have been working on the capital
improvements at the fair.
Mr. Switzer stated that a couple of years ago, the fair was on well and sewer systems. He
said that they constantly had to have their wells checked by the Board of Health, and that
was creating some problems. He said that two years ago, they were able to have city
water brought onto the grounds for $50,000 dollars. He said that this past summer, they
added sewers to the property at a much larger expense. Mr. Switzer stated that they
always try and pay for the projects when they do them, but the sewer project was so large
that they had to take a mortgage out on the property. Mr. Switzer stated that the electrical
systems have been there forever, particularly in the concession area, which pulls more
electricity. This year, the fair is in the process of upgrading the electrical system. Mr.
Switzer stated that the funds they receive from thecity will be able to pay for those repairs.
He said that there are a lot of ongoing problems with the buildings. There are three
buildings that will be used extensively for 4-H during the fair, and the roof leaks on every
one of them. He said that it is quite expensive to repair.
Mr. Phillips stated that the fair has formed a great partnership with the Indiana Job Corp
out at Camp Atterbury. There will be painting, new windows and glazing on the windows in
the colliseum. He said that they are also in partnership with Keep Indianapolis Beautiful
(KIB), and they have planted trees and done some landscaping.
Mr. Phillips stated that the Fair runs from July 22 – 31, 2010, and opening night will be
their second Town Hall Meeting honoring veterans. He said that they have a lot of ideas
that have not all materialized as of yet. He said that some new events coming to the fair
will be Doc Dogs (water sports competition for dogs) and the United States Auto Club

Community Affairs Committee
April 14, 2010
Page 2
(USAC) Off-Road Truck Race. Mr. Phillips stated that rentals are up, and they have
something going on every weekend.
Councillor Pfisterer thanked Mr. Phillips for all that he does. She said that the fair is the
central core for the county that provides a lot of entertainment for quite a few people. She
stated that with regards to the leaky roof situation, that would be a great place to advertise.
She asked if there is any thought to having someone pay for the replacement of the roof in
return for advertising on the roof. Mr. Phillips stated that as far as getting sponsors for
large dollar amount advertising, they have to compete with the Indiana State Fair. He said
that a lot of people with sponsor dollars are looking for a bigger bang for the buck at the
million plus attendance venue, versus the hundred thousand attendances. Mr. Phillips
stated that they continue to try and pursue every lead they can get for sponsorships.
Councillor Pfisterer stated that she travels through that area a lot, which is close to I-74,
and she would think that would be a selling point for the advertiser, and it would not have
to be fair-related.
Mr. Switzer stated that a club called R Cars, which are radio controlled cars, wanted to use
the track located on the eastside of the fairgrounds for the summer months. He said they
then approached them to use the 4-H building. He said that they have done wonders to
the building. They painted and upgraded the building, and it has been a real asset to
bringing in money. Mr. Phillips stated that his goal is to have life out at the fair year-round.
Councillor Minton-McNeill asked if all of the building roofs are leaking, and if the cost is
$16,000 to replace each roof or to stop the leaks. Mr. Switzer stated that they do not
replace the roofs; someone comes in and coats them with some type of material. He said
that it cost them $16,000 to have three buildings done.
Councillor Pfisterer thanked all of the companies and people that go out to the fairgrounds
and donate their time, efforts and materials to make it a better place.
Councillor Minton-McNeill stated that some years ago, there was a group of students who
built houses. She asked if the fair has considered looking into some groups like that which
could come out and do some type of renovation at a discounted. Mr. Phillips stated that
they are also working on grant money for environmentally green projects to be placed on
the property.
Councillor Scales stated that she has been able to attend the fair during the summers and
it is such a do-able fair for young families, especially because it is not an overwhelming
space. She said that it is a very inexpensive evening with parking and admission.
Councillor Day asked if the fair still has their pre-opening night party. Mr. Phillips answered
in the affirmative, stating that this year, the fair will host the younger people from Noble
Center for a couple of hours before the main population gets too crowded.
Mr. Dowden stated that county fairs are part of the heartbeat of Indiana. He said that in
many counties, the taxpayers are burdened with the entire ownership operation of the
fairgrounds. He said that in Marion County’s case, the Council and the Commissioners
agreed that since they were not burdened with ownership, they would help with some of

Community Affairs Committee
April 14, 2010
Page 3
the expenses. Mr. Dowden stated that it is a real savings to the taxpayers, because
operating expenses alone are about $600,000 per year. He said that they have always
used the money from taxpayers toward capital projects, improvements and maintenance.
The actual operating expenses are born by the board through the rentals of the
fairgrounds and the events. Mr. Dowden stated that they are doing the best they can to
maintain the heritage of Marion County.
Councillor Day asked how much they received last year from the Council. Mr. Dowden
stated that it was $100,000.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Community Affairs
Committee of the City County Council was adjourned at 5:51 p.m.

PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE
The Public Works Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, January 19, 2017.
Chairman Zach Adamson called the meeting to order at 5:32 p.m. with the following members
present: Susie Cordi, Monroe Gray, Janice McHenry, Jeff Miller, William Oliver, Vop Osili and
David Ray. Representing Council staff was Fred Biesecker, General Counsel.
Chair Adamson asked each Councillor to introduce themselves and tell which district they
represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 513, 2016 - appoints Mark Lee to the Air Pollution Control Board
Mr. Lee stated that he is a life-long resident of Indianapolis and has been a photographer for
over 30 years. Mr. Lee said that the recent election spurred him to want to do something to help
make the community better. He said that the recent illness and death of his father from
emphysema emphasized his commitment making the air cleaner for the environment.
Chair Adamson stated that this particular board has several requirements, and one of those
requirements is that the Council appointment has to be a small business owner. Mr. Lee will be
filling that requirement.
Councillor Oliver stated that there has been some improvement in air quality and there are
some vibrations from the incoming Administration regarding the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) that regulates the quality of air. He asked if Mr. Lee has given any thought
regarding that. Mr. Lee said that his understanding is that they are trying to do away with air
quality qualifications, but he thinks that they should emphasize those and make them stronger.
Councillor Miller asked about Mr. Lee’s role on the board. Mr. Lee said that he has observed
and written about this board, but he wants to learn more about it. Councillor Miller asked if this
board is more of a complaint or license-driven board. Mr. Biesecker read what the power of the
board does: Sec. 511-209. – Powers of the board
The board may:
(1) Adopt, amend and repeal regulations pursuant to Article IV and establish, by
regulation, prima facie violations of these regulations;
(2) Enforce this chapter and its regulations as provided in Article VI;
(3) Initiate investigations, consider complaints and direct the office to enforce this
chapter and its regulations;
(4) Hold hearings, decide appeals, grant and deny variances and issue direct orders to
comply with this chapter and its regulations;
(5) Appoint a hearing officer or officers for public hearings required in this chapter and
its regulations;
(6) Approve or disapprove office policies submitted to the board by the administrator
Chair Adamson stated that on the City’s website there is a specific definition of the Air Quality
Board.
Councillor McHenry asked if Mr. Lee is appointed to this board, if there would be a possibility to
educate the public on the dangers of smoking and being in a household of smokers, even

Members of the Public Works Committee

though that is not part of air quality. Mr. Lee answered in the affirmative, stating that it could be
a platform for that discussion.
Councillor Oliver moved, seconded by Councillor Gray, to send Proposal No. 513, 2016 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 2, 2017 - appoints Dr. Richard Nass to the Air Pollution Control Board
Dr. Nass stated that he has lived in Indianapolis for nine years. He said that he is an Associate
Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at Indiana University School of Medicine. In his role,
he would use work experience determining the role the environment plays and contributes to
neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Dr. Nass stated that he does a
lot of outreach with different delegations when he travels. He said that his interest in serving on
the board is being able to contribute to his immediate environment and the City. Dr. Nass stated
that he appreciates the aspect of education and communication with the public.
Chair Adamson stated that another requirement for a Council appointment to this board is that
there is a Toxicologist appointed; and Dr. Nass, if appointed, will fill in at that capacity.
Councillor Oliver moved, seconded by Councillor Cordi, to send Proposal No. 2, 2017 to the full
Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Works Committee of
the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:50 p.m.

RE: Asbestos Building Inspection for 305 East Florida, Evansville, Indiana – CES Project
#116-1023.
Dear Mr. Beane:
On June 28, 2016 Caprice Mattingly of Crane Environmental Services, LLC conducted
an Asbestos Building Inspection to determine if there was any Asbestos Containing
Material (ACM) present at the subject property. The site is a vacant house with a
basement and finished attic which is scheduled to be demolished.
Great care was taken to account for all spaces within the building. Hidden spaces were
evaluated by physical or visual inspection as reasonably accessible. Hidden spaces
include inaccessible pipe chases, sub-walls behind exposed walls, layers of tile under
carpet or other tile, roofing materials under impenetrable surfaces, inaccessible sections
of the building, etc. All hidden layers accessible through minor alterations were observed
and tested if suspected for ACM’s. Some hidden areas were assumed to contain the
same materials as accessible areas that were observed.
Nine bulk samples and one duplicate sample of suspect asbestos containing material
were collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis. None of the samples were Asbestos
Containing Material (ACM) defined as any material which contains more than one percent
(1%) asbestos. The laboratory results are attached, and summarized as follows:

There is Regulated Asbestos Containing Material (RACM), Category I, and Category II
ACM located in the house as indicated in the table below. Regulated ACM means (a)
Friable asbestos material, (b) Category I non-friable ACM that has become friable, (c)
Category I non-friable ACM that will be or has been subjected to sanding, grinding,
cutting, or abrading, or (d) Category II non-friable ACM that has a high probability of
becoming or has become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by the forces
expected to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation operations. All
floor tile, sheet vinyl flooring, asphalt roofing products, and flashing present was
presumed to be Category I non-friable Asbestos Containing Material (ACM). The
quantities of RACM and Category I and Category II ACM are summarized in the table
below.

Inhomogeneous samples are separated into homogeneous subsamples and analyzed individually. ND means no fibers were detected. When
detected, the minimum detection and reporting limit is less than 1% unless point counting is performed. Floor tile samples may contain large
amounts of interference material and it is recommended that the sample be analyzed by gravimetric point count analysis to lower the detection
limit and to aid in asbestos identification.

Wayne County Interim Report
The significance of each inventory entry was evaluated by a professional architectural
historian at Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana and was measured against the
National Register Criteria for evaluation. Properties were assessed in terms of their
historical significance, architectural merit, environment, and integrity before being placed
in one of the rating categories...
In assessing integrity, an attempt was made to determine how much of the original
architectural fabric remained. A property’s rating may have been lowered if it
experienced extensive alterations, such as the application of artificial siding, removal of
trim or porches, later additions, changes to windows, or structural modifications.

Rating System
After considerations of these factors, one of the following ratings as assigned to each
property:

Outstanding (O)
The ‘O’ rating means that a property has enough historic or architectural significance that
it is already listed, or should be considered for individual listing, in the National Register
of Historic Places. “Outstanding” resources can be of local, state, or national importance.

Notable (N)
The rating of ‘N’ means that the property did not quite merit an “Outstanding” rating, but
is still above average in its importance. Further research or investigation may reveal that
the property could be eligible for National Register listing.

Contributing (C)
A ‘C’ rating was given to any properties meeting the basic inventory criterion of being
pre-1950, but that are not important enough to stand on their own as individually
“Outstanding” or “Notable.” Such resources are important to the density or continuity of
the area’s historic fabric. “Contributing” properties can be listed in the National Register
of Historic Places if they are part of a historic district, but would not usually qualify
individually.

Non-contributing (NC)
Properties rated ‘NC’ were not included in the inventory unless they were located within
a historic district. Such properties are usually either built after 1950 or are older
structures that have been badly altered and have lost historic character or are otherwise
incompatible with their historical surroundings. These properties are not eligible for the
National Register.
Of the 6,766 entries made in the Wayne County inventory, 269 were rated
“Outstanding” and 1,040 rated “Notable.”
These ratings should be viewed as advisory recommendations based on the information
available to the survey. Change in location, sensitive restoration, additional research,
extensive physical damage, or inappropriate remodeling could affect the entry’s
significance and rating at a later date.

****** BUTTIGIEG, CITY TO HOLD PANEL DISCUSSION ON STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE ******

Mayor Pete Buttigieg and the City of South Bend will host a panel discussion on
strengthening the relationship between the community and the police on
Thursday, September 8th at 6:30 pm. The event, which will take place at the
Kroc Center at 900 W. Western Ave., will discuss the public perception of race,
legitimacy of law enforcement and the historical view of race relations between
police and communities of color.
“This is an exceptionally important topic, and South Bend can lead the way in
addressing the issues that all diverse communities are facing right now.”
Mayor Buttigieg said. “Like every diverse American community, we have a lot
of work to do, but our city has shown it is capable of coming together to make
progress.”
Panelists will include:
    * Scott Ruszkowski, Chief of the South Bend Police Department
    * Darryl Boykins, SBPD Captain
    * Travis Teague, SBPD Patrolman Officer
    * Dr. Richard Pierce, Notre Dame professor and author of Polite Protest:
      The Political Economy of Race in Indianapolis
    * Savino Rivera Jr., Bilingual Education Specialist at Adams High School
    * Taloni Reese, Artist, Activist and Student at Indiana Wesleyan University
    * William Horton, Rising Senior and member of B.R.O.T.H.E.R.S. group at
      Adams High School
Chief Ruszkowski is committed to developing strong relationships between SBPD
and the community it serves.
“What is it that police can do to help our family? What is it that our family
needs? What is it that our family wants?” Ruszkowski said. “That’s how
we’re going to operate. Come to me with those answers and I will help, and so
will my other brothers and sisters that are part of your family, too.”
Eric Love, Director of Staff Diversity and Inclusion at the University of Notre
Dame, will serve as moderator for the event.

City of Elkhart

ElkhartWood Program
ElkhartWood is a community-supported urban forest outreach and education program. It challenges us to think about the city
forest as more than just the trees that are growing along streets and in parks, but to think creatively about how we as citizens
can contribute to our urban canopy and how we can make the best use of city trees after they come down. The ElkhartWood
program connects people to the urban canopy of our city by finding the value of community-grown trees and putting it towards
planting the next generation of tree canopy in the city. ElkhartWood is full-circle urban forestry; finding value and increasing
capacity for trees that are here, trees that are gone and the trees that are yet to grow.

Program Components
Urban Wood Utilization

The backbone of ElkhartWood is urban wood utilization. The
concept is straightforward. High-quality sawlogs that come
from trees removed by the city forestry division as part of
their normal operations are made available for purchase by
local sawyers and woodworkers for value-added processing,
keeping the product local and its unique history intact. Thus
when the city has to remove trees, this program allows them
to be put to their highest and best use. These trees are part of
the stories and places of Elkhart and as open-grown trees
many have unique and special characteristics that allow them
to be made into one-of-a-kind furniture and other items.

Community Tree Planting

This program component serves as the crucial outlet for the
funds generated though log sales. These funds go directly to
purchase trees for community greening projects. Essentially,
trees that come down within the city have a value and by
capturing that value through the log sales we can invest it
directly into planting more trees in the city. The trees planted
help replace trees lost to disease including Emerald Ash Borer
(EAB), storm events and natural senescence.

Education, Workshops, and Events

Providing educational opportunities is an important part of
this program that allows us to maximize the benefits of the
trees in our urban forest. Programs and workshops are offered
to expand the capacity for individuals to utilize and value
Elkhart-grown logs and wood products, support proper tree
planting and care, learn more about trees, and gain green job
skills. The city’s annual Arbor Day is an opportunity to raise
awareness within the community about the important of trees
and the urban forest as well as create awareness and support
for the ElkhartWood program.

Program Goal
Our goal is a self-sustaining, comprehensive urban natural
resources program that provides increasing, long-term
benefits to the city and its citizens through an urban wood
utilization program that creates access to this unique raw
material and generates funds for community tree plantings
and educational opportunities that enhance and strengthen
the community.

The Elkhart Wood Products Network
The Elkhart Wood Products Network includes
woodworkers, sawyers, and others involved in wood
products. These individuals have given their time and talent
to the development of the urban wood utilization
program. They provide insight and feedback for developing
and improving the program as well as purchase logs that
come from city trees.

Contact Us
Please contact the program coordinators for more
information about this program and how you can get
involved.

The meeting was called to order at 9:30 a.m.
Minutes:
A motion was made to approve the July 19, 2005 IT Board minutes. The motion was seconded and passed
unanimously.
ISA Report
Mr. Banning, CIO, stated that Premis Consulting Group was hired to review the NG maintenance contract. He
complimented Premis on their ability in getting staff to this point. They facilitated a one hour customer
satisfaction project attended by a focus group. The issues fell into 7 major categories:
Understanding of the customer’s business
Lack of rigor/poor technical homework
Financial value
Communication
Contractual Issues
Structure
Technical
Mr. Banning emphasized the importance of Northrup Grumman and ISA hearing what customers concerns are.
Premis suggested 27 action steps. Mr. Geis will be the BRM assigned to facilitate the recommendations.
Major Ball thanked Premis and the participants in the focus group. He thought the group was energetic and
very vocal. He appreciated the openness of those that participated. It provided the CIO and Project Manager
good input on the current customer impressions of ISA/NG.
Mr. Banning stated in the 30 days the staff will review the recommendations. Issues identified will be forwarded
to the BRMs and on to Project Management and to NG. Meetings are scheduled to work on an action plan.
Ms. Sadler stated this is more than just a challenge. Customer satisfaction is very low.

Information Technology Board
Meeting Minutes
Mr. Banning stated that the group that attended the workshop represents ‘super users’. They are the individuals
that drive technology. There are six thousand customers which are surveyed on a regular basis. Mr. Banning
stated he understands the results are not up to par and communication needs to improve.
ISA Financial Report
Ms. Patel stated the report describes the financial position of ISA in four areas: 2004 vs. 2005 budget
comparison, Year to Date Revenue Statement, July 2004 vs. July 2005 Contract Comparison, and 2005
Application Maintenance and Support Expenditures.
ISA expenditures for July 2005 totalled $15.9 million or 52%. ISA has collected $14.5 million dollars or 51% of
our projected revenue for YTD July 2005, which includes payments received for the 4th quarter 2004 billings.
Ms. Patel stated the BRMs have been instrumental in relaying to the departments where they stand.
2006 Budget
ISA Expenses are charged back to City and County agencies through chargeback, pass through, and telephone
billing. The ISA budget is in the City-County budget twice, first in the Department/Agency’s budget, and again in
ISA’s budget.
ISA has been able to reduce its budget by restructuring the outsourcing contract, consolidating some internal
functions, and reviewing reductions in our capital expenditures.
Ms. Enders asked if the capital expenditures noted were for infrastructure. Mr. Banning clarified that they were
for security, infrastructure, Justis.Net, property tax system and items such as pc upgrades and licenses.
Mr. Rodman asked that in dollars what is the amount quantified and what significant changes may be in store for
2007 ½ million or 7 million. Mr. Banning stated that ISA has yet to scope the property system’s test,
development, and production environment, voter registration additional desktops, etc. Ms. Sadler stated the
voter registration will not have hardware requirements. They will be paid for by State. Mr. Ricketts asked about
budgeting for a 2-year refresh program. Mr. Banning stated that would be included in the equipment budget.
Mr. Ricketts asked if any reserves have been planned for in the event a major piece of hardware fails or is ISA
just going to wait until something goes wrong. Mr. Banning requested 1 month to research and reply to Mr.
Ricketts.
Major Ball stated that with other agencies adhering to budget cuts he is not happy with ISA’s increase. He
would like ISA to hold down costs as other agencies have. Ms. Patel stated that maintenance agreement
increases forced ISA expenses up and cuts were made in other areas. Mr. Clifford stated moving forward with
standards policies will work toward fixed costs of hardware and software and allow for continuity. He added that
IPD is doing a great job managing their funds.
Civic.Net
Ms. Biddinger presented the Civic.Net update to the Board. She stated they have collected 1.7 million in
revenue which is a 16% increase. They added 2 new services. Two agencies installed the over-the-counter
credit card processing systems: Corporation Counsel and Department of Metropolitan Development.
Corporation Counsel, City Collections, Division, is now accepting credit card payments for Court 13 fines. DMD
is accepting credit card for zoning fines and violations.
Resolution 05-17
Resolution 05-17 to reimburse the Marion County Clerk, the Marion County Treasurer, the Marion County
Justice Agency for expenses incurred related to the Provision of Enhanced Access to Public Records.

Meeting Minutes
A motion was made to approve Resolution 05-17. The motion was seconded and passed unanimously.
Introduction of Northrup Grumman Program Manager
Mr. Grazda introduced Mr. Jeff Clancy as the new Northrup Grumman Program Manager. Mr. Grazda
acknowledges it was a priority with this Board to hire a permanent Program Manager. Mr. Clancy has many
years experience and background in information technology. Mr. Grazda stated he has been on site for 2
months as Director of Public Relations. He reports to Hernan Vera. He intends to facilitate best practices,
adding personnel, and developing methods to improve delivery.
Ms. Enders welcomed Mr. Clancy to the ISA team. Mr. Clifford stated he is glad corporate (NG) is paying
attention to what is happening here in Indianapolis.
Northrup Grumman Update
Mr. Banning discussed the SLRs. The proposed SLRs would reduce the number from 124 to 59 with the overall
dollar value remaining the same. ISA and NG worked together to ensure that the remaining SLRs would cover
all of the critical systems to the level that was expected from day one.
The process would include combining a number of SLRs, clarifying a large number of SLRs, fold a number of
hardware-based SLRs into the application-based SLRs that reside on the hardware, work with NG management
staff to modify a couple of the existing SLRs, delete SLRs that do not make financial sense or are not our
responsibility (i.e. responsibility of SBC), adjust the weights of some of the credits, and sign a letter of
understanding.
July SLR Report
10 SLRs were not reported (8 with credits, 2 without credits)
11 were missed for July
NG will pay credits for 8 SLRs for the month of July ($73,553)
Ms. Sadler stated she has two issues. First is the issue of reducing the SLRs. The second is the credit issue.
She did not believe the board gave the CIO the authority to change the SLRs. She received Mr. Banning’s
memorandum dated July 26 and has reviewed it. When this contract was approved it was recognized as one of
the most advanced IT contracts. It nailed down so specifically the large number of requirements. She had
concern that the people that negotiated that contract, specifically Corporation Counsel and Lewis and Kappes
have not been involved in this reconfiguration of the SLRs. They may be able to provide some explanation for
why there are 125 SLRs. She did not believe the Board gave the CIO the authority to modify the contract when
the contract presented was so specific for a reason. There is a reason why there are 125 SLRs. Those reasons
need to be examined. Ms. Sadler did not agree with the reasons given by NG to lower the dollar amount. NG
should abide by the contract they agreed to. Regarding the Feb-June credit issues she stated these are difficult
financial times. Budgets are being cut. NG entered this contract knowing what the SLRs were. Ms. Sadler
does not agree with the strategy to avoid dispute resolution by simply agreeing to a dollar amount. The Board
gave authority to negotiate that amount. She hoped to receive a recommendation from Mr. Banning.
Mr. Banning stated he would like to avoid the cost of dispute resolution. The 13 points were directly from NG
and were not edited. There are 250 projects for users. The focus group and staff have met with Premis to gain
an understanding of the customer service needs. Mr. Banning would like to focus on those types of issues as
well. NG is our partner. They have proposals to save this enterprise money. Mr. Banning discussed with legal
extensively his recommendation and believes it serves the best interest. Mr. Ricketts stated he would
appreciate Mr. Banning taking the time and effort to gain an insight to the reason for the 125 SLRs. He stated
he appreciates Mr. Banning working hard with NG but to reduce the SLRs from 125 to 50 is not doing a service
to tax payers.

Meeting Minutes
Mr. Clifford asked if Mr. Banning received responses to his 16 page proposal.
Ms Enders stated she supports managing contracts through change management. She was shocked at the
proposal to reduce the SLRs from 125-59 but believes it in a practical, realistic environment will support the
decision of the CIO.
Ms. Sadler was concerned the City of Indianapolis-Marion County would be at risk by reducing the required
SLRs. She offered that she is not unwilling to consider changing those SLRs but why did NG agree to 125
SLRs if they were unattainable. The other vendor involved in the best and final offer negotiations stated they
could not meet the 125 SLRs. Ms. Sadler stated this is more than ‘tweaking the contract’. The SLRs are just an
indication of the service that is supposed to be provided to our users. Our users are unhappy. The Justis
system was down for 18 hours. Ms. Sadler added that we have only been in this contract a few months. NG
has a contractual obligation if they do not produce. She recommended the board request additional details and
push the vendor harder.
Mr. Poulakidas stated he did not believe the City/County were liable. The contract was awarded as a result of a
best and final offer. The selection was based on what each party negotiated. This is after the fact and separate
from the bid process. As for the CIO having the authority to reduce the SLRs according to Municipal Code 281222 and the NG contract section 1.10.4 allows ISA and NG to have discussions as a process of managing their
relations.
Mr. Rodman stated this is a policy making board and why are we not enforcing the penalties that are due per
contract. He expressed how concerned he was about waiving the credits. He stated they should be enforced
for two reasons. If in a contract there should be a penalty then there should be a penalty. Second, these are
tough financial times and to not collect what is due is not being a responsible steward of the taxpayer’s funds.
All that aside, he stated the Board picked Mr. Banning as CIO and should not micro-manage. Mr. Rodman
expected that if a penalty is not truly a penalty when discussion turns to bonuses he would hope that they be
negotiated also.
Mr. Ricketts agreed with Ms. Sadler that the City/County would be vulnerable if the Board agrees to reduce the
125 SLRs. Mr. Ricketts suggested the Board agree to a letter of understanding that legally supersedes what is
in the contract.
Mr. Clifford commented that no document had been drafted. The agreement is between the CIO and NG. He
stated continuing to arbitrate would result in internal and external costs. The original contract was the result of
three separate winners. He believes the consolidation makes sense in a long term partnership. He stated that
we are trying to provide service and move forward.
Ms. Enders stated not taking a hard stance on the $200,000 credit is a hard pill to swallow especially when ISA
is proposing a budget increase. She recommended to go back to drawing board and increase the settlement
through change management documents.
Ms. Sadler requested a very detailed written explanation be provided how that amount was determined and very
specific justification for that be presented.
JUSTIS.NET
Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Renner presented an update on the JUSTIS.NET project. Mr. Renner had presented an
update to the JTAC stakeholders last week. Mr. Renner describes the overall JUSTIS.NET project as 2
separate projects. The infrastructure project. The second is the conversion of .Net in relationship to JTAC. It
has been identified as the module for the State CMS project. Our partners DAI & CA are working with JTAC to
make sure the identical tools are being used so that when completed it will have the same look and feel as the
state-wide system. Another benefit is that as a result of this project direct support from Microsoft has been
made available. This is a huge benefit that everyone will gain from. The test and development site that was set

up off site was done with zero (additional) dollars to the County. Mr. Clifford asked if there are any potential
obstacles and when is the project proposed to go into service. Mr. Thamba stated the production environment
is a challenge but it is robust enough to handle the users. Mr. Banning commented that at the IT Team Mr.
Grigsby addressed some of the risks associated with a .Net environment.
Property System Update
Mr. Rutherford presented the Property System Update to the Board. He stated the following:

ISA Report
Operations
ISA teamed with Northrop Grumman, IPD, MCSD, CPI, Brighthouse
Cable Communications, and Best Buy to provide IT services for
evacuees being housed by Red Cross at the Indiana State Fair
Grounds. When the request for help came in from Mayor Bart
Peterson, everyone responded. Thanks to everyone for all of their
help and support.
Northrop Grumman demonstrated several backup and storage
solutions. The current equipment in the Intel Server farm will not be
able to keep up with expected storage demands. Adding additional
storage to older equipment will result in higher maintenance costs. We
are using three different back-up solutions. It would be beneficial to
consolidate these solutions into one platform.
ISA has been developing a spreadsheet listing major infrastructure
costs that are forecasted for the next five years.
Northrop Grumman has established server outage alerts for requesting
customers. The designated representatives will receive an automated
text page when the specified server is down.
The GroupWise 6.5 client rollout is ahead of schedule. All agencies
have been installed except IFD. The final rollout should be complete
9/27.
Operations staff met with Kirk from Cannon IV to discuss how printer
service will work on printers purchased from them under the new “Big
Deal” pricing. We will be working with NG to get them up to speed and
to ensure we have processes and procedures in place to make this a
smooth transition.
Dell Rep Brett Felton presented to our customers an 18 month
roadmap of where technology is going in the PC, laptop, printer, and
server realm. We discussed with IPD an initiative where they will be
adding cameras to light poles. We discussed bringing a partner of Dell
in to talk to both IPD and DPW to see how we may be able to share
and leverage our technology investments.

We are working with several external agencies to provide service for
the new Fusion Center. This project will be funded by Homeland
Security grants. The team would like for the center to be operational
by December.
Northrop Grumman announced a Deputy Program Manager for the
Northrop Grumman City/County engagement, Roger Murphy. Roger is
from Franklin, IN and has an extensive background in Information
Technology.
The Operations team successfully implemented kiosks in the remote
offices for Probation. These kiosks will be used by probationers to
verify that they have completed their visit to the site.
We have continued to work on refining the design of many of our HP
Openview reports that monitor service levels. This tool continues to
increase in productivity.
Northrop Grumman has tested many SPAM solutions. Several have
proven to be effective in our environment. MailFrontier and
Proofpoint appear to be viable solutions. Currently, we are finishing
the trial with Proofpoint. We will be determining which product to
recommend implementing for the enterprise.
ISA has been awarded three Homeland Security grants to provide new
technology. A Fiber Optic Infrastructure will provide self-healing, high
speed, fault tolerant fiber optic rings. These rings will provide for well
managed, secure, encrypted high speed connections for Public Safety
in Marion and Hamilton County. A Cyber-Security installation will
provide various types of network security tools used in a layered
approach to apply a defensive posture around information technology
assets. And, we will be adding the voice network to the SONET ring for
survivability and disaster recovery. This will offer voice backup in the
event of catastrophic failure.
We have been reviewing patch management tools that can deliver
patches to the desktop, servers, routers, and mobile units. This
automation would provide faster service in providing security to the
environment. Additionally, it will free up resources to use in other
areas of implementation and service.
We are working with Indy Parks to provide IT services to their learning
facilities. Northrop Grumman has been working with broadband
providers for solutions to implement internet connectivity for many
different agency requests. These services will be kept separate from
our network and will provide a vehicle for many different application
requirements.

The refining of the Northrop Grumman contracted SLR’s is complete.
And the final outstanding Milestones are being addressed.
Northrop Grumman continues to identify problem areas that result in
the performance of their SLR’s. They have been focusing on the
continuation of improvement in meeting their goals.
Indy Parks Customer Service was successfully moved to their new
location at 601 E 17th St.

Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Major IT Project Expenditures
At the August 16, 2005 IT Board meeting, several Board
members asked for estimates on large City County IT expenditures
that could be expected over the next several years. The attached
spreadsheet reflects ISA’s and Northrop Grumman’s best estimate at
these expenditures. These figures are rough estimates and do not
reflect actual budget submissions for the years indicated. These costs
are considered enterprise costs or upgrades and do not reflect specific
requests for new systems.

Please note: The YTD August 2004 expenses for ACS totaled $7,541 million. This expense for ACS does not
include the following:
A). The cost for the Business Consultants (currently reclassified as Business Relationship Managers within ISA).
B). Any Pass through charges & New Application Development. (In 2005 no new application dollars budgeted.)
It does however; include the cost for Maintenance and Support. In 2004 the contractual dollars allocated for
Application Development included Maintenance & Support along w/ New Development. This breakdown was
75% for Maintenance and Support and 25% for New Development for 2004. Prior to 2004, the split was more
50% for Maintenance and Support and 50% for New Development.
Based on the chart above there is a contract savings of $654K for year to date 2005, and based on this trend,
we are projecting a contract savings of approximately $981K by the end of calendar year 2005.

CIVICNET HIGHLIGHTS
Reminder: Financial data is reported on a one-month delay. This means that
financials for August 2005 will be detailed in the report distributed in October
2005.

With more than 38,000 transactions logged in August, CivicNet
set a new one-month record for activity. Increases were seen in
every service area, and the total funds collected for the
city/county have topped $2.3 million for the year. In August
alone, the Division of Compliance collected nearly $150,000 in
fees, while various agencies using the Over-the-Counter credit
card service for their walk-in customers collected more than
$75,000 – at no cost to the city/county.
The Treasurer’s Office is testing the new Bulk Search Service
with anticipated deployment in mid-September, which will
alleviate the strain of large customer requests for parcel
information that are currently processed manually. CivicNet is
assisting the office in marketing the service to its existing
customers – a “Coming Soon” notice was developed for
inclusion in invoices mailed in early September, and a letter with
detailed information about using the new online service will be
mailed later in the month.
CivicNet will deliver the Division of Compliance’s Online Craft
License Renewal service to the agency to begin testing in early
September, with deployment scheduled for October. The
CivicNet marketing team has developed a direct mail notification
for all craft contractors that will be mailed last week of October.
All current craft licenses expire at the end of 2005. This project
is expected to save thousands of staff hours each year, eliminate
the manual data-entry process for license renewals and get
licenses into contractors’ hands earlier.
CivicNet is working with the MCSD to develop an online service
that will allow users to deposit money into an inmate’s
commissary account at the Marion County Jail and Jail Annex.
This project is in the requirements-gathering phase.
In August, posters were delivered for the Office of Corporation
Counsel to promote their new OTC service. The marketing staff
also worked with DPW to design and produce a version of their
agency brochure in Spanish. New office signage was delivered
for Citizens Services and the Division of Compliance -consisting of a combined total of seven new posters.

Credit Claim Form
(To be submitted when credits are claimed by
Information Services Agency towards Northrop Grumman)

In accordance with the Contractual Agreement between Northrop Grumman and the City-County (ISA),
Northrop Grumman has been charged credits in the amount(s) stated below:
Section 6.8 (Incentives and Schedules), “Schedule D Specifies certain, Incentives and Credits that may be
imposed in the event of any failure or earn back in respect of the Provider’s actual performance of Services
as measured against the Critical Milestones or the Critical SLR’s. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Credits set forth in Schedule D are intended to reflect the diminished value of Services as a result of any
service level failure. City/County and Provider agree that Credits do not constitute penalties or damages,
but rather are intended to equalize the fee for services to a level of fair-market value…,” and;
Section 16.1.2, (Invoices and Reports) "Any credits in accordance section 6.8 of the agreement may be
applied against the provider's invoices with appropriate information attached."
Note: Formula for Credit claims: Total contract value / 12 (monthly contract value) / 630 points (total number of points assigned to SLR’s) = single point value or
($8,826,300 / 12) / 630 = $1168 per point.

Northrop Grumman
Input to the IT Board
Monthly Status Report
September 20, 2005
Northrop Grumman is proud to announce that Roger Murphy has accepted the
offer to become the Deputy Program Manager for the Northrop Grumman
City/County engagement. Roger has a rich Information Technology background
from a senior management standpoint and has held senior Information
Technology leadership positions in outsourcing engagements for major
outsourcing organizations. We are pleased to have Roger as a part of our team.
Northrop Grumman has had several members of the senior management team
visit the site, interact with the staff, and attend meetings with members of the IT
Board. This effort is the Northrop Grumman commitment to understand the
issues and provide immediate corrective action whether that is in the form of
additional resources or specific skills located elsewhere in the company. This
practice will continue on a month to month basis throughout the term of the
agreement.
Continuing through the month of August, the focus has been on improved SLR
performance in the help desk administration area and adding tools to facilitate
the data gathering and reporting process.
The E-Service feature has been added to Siebel. E-Service allows end users to
submit and monitor status of their help desk tickets from their desktops. It is also
the facility that will be used to gather end user satisfaction with I/T services. The
E-Service facility has been extended to a pilot group of users of Indianapolis
Information Technology during the month of August. The result of the pilot will
determine how to proceed with the broader user audience.
A new Siebel reporting tool, “Analytics”, has been implemented. This tool will
allow on the spot reporting of performance to SLR’s. The prior method was to
aggregate the monthly ticket data manually and then report by the 10th of the
month. During the month of August we ran parallel tests with the manual method
of gathering data and Analytics do ensure consistency and integrity of reporting.
Once we have completed our analysis Analytics will be used on a day by day
basis to view help desk performance and make corrections to failing trends
before impacts are seen by the end user.
Northrop Grumman has developed an SLR Dashboard Application. This
application will allow Northrop Grumman and ISA staff to be able to have a day to
day view of all of the SLR performance data. This tool will receive daily
performance data from the Siebel Help Desk tool, the HP Openview tool,

1

mainframe systems statistical information and other data sources. The tool will
perform the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

At the close of business on each day, all SLR data is extracted into a
single repository.
Intranet-based, graphical display of all SLR performance measurements is
readily available for management and staff review.
Eliminates the need for manual data extraction and formatting.
Allows user to view performance at a high-level or to “drill-down” for more
details.
Browser based - no desktop software to install.
Reports can be printed or exported via Crystal Enterprise.

The SLR dashboard application is currently being tested. Northrop Grumman will
demonstrate the features of this important tool at the October 2005 IT Board
meeting.
Bob Mount from our Siebel Corporate support team has been onsite all month to
address Siebel issues. He has established the contact directory for all
City/County users. He has also assisted in automating the reporting process so
that immediate access to performance data is readily available.
The help desk staff that was added in July and August has helped improve SLR
trends that were previously unfavorable. Expectations are that while some of the
same SLR’s are being missed the gap is closing. The additional staff is giving us
the encouragement that these SLR’s will not be missed during the month of
September 2005.
Northrop Grumman is pleased to announce that an offer has been extended and
accepted by Celina Oblinger. In past months, Celina has assisted the
Indianapolis Help Desk operations in a consulting capacity. Celina comes from
the Northrop Grumman Unocal account. The Unocal account has been using the
Siebel product for over three years. During this time Celina has gained a great
deal of experience with the product, implementing best practices and statistical
reporting. Celina will be joining the Northrop Grumman Indianapolis team on a
full time basis in September.
Northrop Grumman has had Donna Guido, Sr. Project Manager, visit the site to
understand the project workflow process and the project portfolio. Donna has
made some recommendations on a Portfolio Management system that will
facilitate project resource planning and consumption. Donna will also be visiting
the site in September to work with ISA in defining the Service Request and
Project workflow process.
Hewlett Packard OpenView (HP OpenView) is a network-based product that will
sample the health of all network-connected devices and send health reports for
2

technical staff review. This product has now been installed on the City/County
network and is monitoring network and server events on a proactive basis. The
tool is now producing reports for the data center, server and network
components. Rick Altosino from the Northrop Grumman architecture team has
been onsite in Indianapolis to assist in the ongoing operation of this critical tool.
Gerald Mc Garvin from Hewlett Packard Corp. has been onsite assisting Rick.
Gerald will continue to assist to ensure that all expectations are met. These
individuals are analyzing the tool deployment and making recommendations to fill
any reporting gaps that may exist. It is anticipated that this level of expertise will
be onsite in the months to come as the tool matures.
Northrop Grumman has had Billy Edmondson, another corporate resource,
assisting in the asset management area. Billy has been instrumental in
developing procedures for the new assets being installed and keeping those
under control.
Two contract milestones are being deferred. These are the Technology Refresh
Plan, which is dependent on an accurate asset data, and the Technology Plan,
which is dependent on the Information Technology Strategy. NGC is working with
ITSA on these milestones, as plans need to be in place for future technology
deployment. A re-scoping of these plans seems to be the favored approach so
that something of value can be delivered rather than wait.
Northrop Grumman has signed and executed an agreement with Mathews and
Company to perform an end user Information Technology Services satisfaction
survey. Mathews and Company has performed these services on other Northrop
Grumman accounts. Mathews and Company has been onsite August 12 and
performed a workshop. The workshop identified the demographics and the
content of the survey to be utilized. Mathews and Company has delivered the
first set of survey questions for review and comment. This review process will
continue until the question set is solidified. The process going forward will be to
finalize the question set, implement the survey on the internet and push out
emails to the end users reminding them of the survey and soliciting feedback.
The SA3 Applications group completed the DMD Cashier Module
implementation. In addition Northrop Grumman is wrapping up the major
enhancements to the ePAR application. The target date for delivering this
application for user acceptance testing was in early December. This function will
be delivered approximately 3 months early. Northrop Grumman is also
developing the Coroner Case Management System. This project continues to
progress nicely and slightly ahead of schedule. Regular meetings with the client
and ISA BRM have gone very well and everyone seems to be pleased with the
progress and the product.

1 Background
The IT Outsourcing contract between Indianapolis/Marion County and Northrop Grumman
includes 61 Service Level Requirements (SLR). There are several tools utilized to measure
and track Northrop Grumman’s performance, each of which store information in their own
database(s). It was a very tedious and time consuming task to extract and gather the
required information and format it into an easily readable and detailed report.
In addition, it was very difficult to monitor performance on a daily basis. Management needed
to be able to quickly access performance data on a daily basis to identify areas that needed
improvement.
An intranet based, graphical, digital dashboard was suggested. The dashboard application
would extract the required performance data from all of the disparate data sources and store
them in a single repository. It would display a high-level view of the SLR performance data
with the option to “drill down” to the detailed data, if desired.

Siebel Field Service is fully integrated with all Siebel applications and can be seamlessly
integrated with existing third-party applications and legacy systems to provide service
organizations with a comprehensive, multi-channel solution that allows them to better satisfy
their customers.
Siebel stores information regarding help desk tickets (response time, resolution time, etc.) in
an Oracle database. In addition, an image copy of the database, with nightly incremental
updates, along with additional calculated fields, exists for Analytics reporting.
2.2

HP OpenView

The HP OpenView portfolio of management solutions helps you take control of your IT and
telecommunications resources. By giving you tools to troubleshoot problems, adapt quickly to

HP Openview stores information related to network performance (availability, response time,
resource utilization, etc.) in a Microsoft SQL server database.
2.3

ASG-TMON for MVS

ASG-TMON™ for MVS is a dynamic solution for monitoring every area of IBM's MVS,
OS/390®, and z/OS operating systems across every partition in your enterprise. It provides
real-time performance information on important software and hardware resources and longterm online data for after the fact analysis of resource usage trends, service levels, I/O
contention, job delays, exceptions, and more. It is designed specifically for systems
programmers, performance analysts, application tuners, and operations personnel, and it
includes powerful exception processing and productivity-enhancing utilities.

4 PROPOSED SOLUTION
An intranet-based, C#.net application with a SQL Server backend will be designed. This
application will extract the required data from all of the disparate data sources on a nightly
basis (the extract can take place around midnight, when there is little activity). It will store
this data in the dashboard repository database. (Refer to Table 3).

TABLE 3 - Proposed Solution Flowchart
Utilizing a combination of ASP.net and Crystal Reports, a series of screens will be developed
to display the SLR performance by category, with the ability to drill down to the specific
details related to an SLR. These screens will be available on the Indygov intranet.

7 RESOURCES REQUIRED
The following resources are required to develop the proposed solution documented above.
Developers:
This project will require 2 full-time .net/Crystal developers for approximately 40
man-hours each. They are currently in the midst of a major development
project for the Coroner. If they are ahead of schedule, I will pull them off for this
project.
File Access:
The developers will need to have ODBC access to the Siebel database and/or
the Analytics copy of the Siebel database located in Lafayette, Colorado. This
is critical to the success of this project, the current method of manually
exporting data from Siebel to Microsoft Excel is NOT an option. The file is too
large and the process takes too long.
We MUST be able to directly run queries and Crystal against the database,
read-only, in order to extract the required data.
Tools:
Business Objects sells a Siebel Integration Kit that makes the development of
Crystal reports against the Siebel database much quicker and easier. At this
time, the cost of this tool is unknown. This tool is not critical to the success of
the project, it would just speed it up.
HP has an Openview SDK available. This would make the extraction of
information from the HP Openview database easier and quicker. The cost of
this SDK is unknown at this time. We are not sure if we can extract the
information without this tool. It may be critical to the success of the project.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1
BETWEEN
INFORMATION SERVICES AGENCY
AND
NORTHROP GRUMMAN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES CONTRACT
Acknowledging that the Information Services Agency Indianapolis Marion County (ISA) and Northrop
Grumman Information Technologies Inc, (NG) entered into an contractual relationship for information
technology Services (Original Agreement) on September 1, 2004; and
Acknowledging that both ISA and NG wish to broaden their cooperation within the confines of the
original agreement to improve customers service.
ISA and NG intend to initiate additional administrative changes to facilitate the improvement of
customer services as described below:
Overall Objective
The overall objective of this Letter of Understanding is to streamline Service Level Requirements
(SLR’s) to a more manageable, market driven balance, in accordance with Section 6.8 of the original
agreement. “The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Credits set forth in Schedule D are intended
to reflect the diminished value of the Services as a result of any service level failure. City/County and
Provider agree that Credits do not constitute penalties or damages, but rather are intended to
equalize the fee for services to a level of fair market value net of City/County’s expenses incurred as
a result of Provider’s failure to delivery the Services as bargained.”
The ongoing review of SLR’s, and possible modifications thereof, will occur from time to time when
both parties agree, in accordance section 1.10.2 of the original agreement, “Provider shall meet with
City/County at least quarterly, or more frequently if requested by City/County, to review Provider’s
actual performance against the SLRs and shall recommend remedial actions to resolve any
performance deficiencies,” The documentation of such administrative actions will occur with the use
of a Letter of Understanding (LOU).
Service Level Requirements
Pursuant to section 1.10.4 of the original agreement, “The Parties shall review and discuss the SLRs
and Fees from time to time, but not less frequently than once each Contract Year. Upon mutual
agreement, after any such review, the SLRs and Fees may be adjusted, for the benefit of
City/County,” Both parties hereby agree to modify the SLR’s in accordance with mutually agreed
upon parameters. Attachment A, containing all SLR’s cited in the original agreement, has been
added to this LOU for reference purposes. Attachment B contains the modified SLR’s which have
been mutually agreed upon as being feasible by ISA and NG.
Claiming of Credits
NG Agrees to credit ISA, in accordance with the procedures detailed in the Original Agreement,
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000). The mentioned credit is for missed Milestones and
SLR’s accumulated from February, 2005 through and including June, 2005.
Additionally, NG agrees to provide a Deputy Project Manager for up to six (6) months. NG’s price for
the additional Deputy Project Manager is approximately twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) per month.
Also, NG will absorb all costs for transferring SA3 staff to SA1 through December 2005. Additionally,
NG agrees to provide an Asset Manager to the City/County at no additional cost, for the period of
January through August. NG’s price for the mentioned Asset Inventory Manager, including travel, is
estimated at twenty-four

The ElkhartWood Program
The ElkhartWood Program is a
community-supported urban forest
outreach and education program. The goal is
a self-sustaining, comprehensive, full-circle
program that provides increasing, long-term
benefits to the city and its citizens through
an urban wood utilization program that
generates fund from the sale of a unique
raw material, city logs, which is reinvested in
the community through the purchase of
trees for community tree plantings and
educational opportunities that enhance and
strengthen the community.
Since 2014, ElkhartWood has contributed to enhanced urban areas within
the city where trees has been lost due to disease including the Emerald
Ash Borer (EAB), storm events and natural senescence. Amazing examples
of what can be made from urban and reclaimed logs can be seen in the
annual Elkhartwood Showcase at the EEC and at EnviroFest. ElkhartWood
logs have been also been incorporated into some of the beautiful wood
structures you can see around the Wellfield Botanic Gardens.

staff should come after a recommendation by the Rules and Public Policy Committee. She
moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to refer these appointments to the Rules and Public
Policy Committee. President Vaughn said that his understanding is that the initial appointment of
these senior staff members should come at the recommendation of the committee, but these are
reappointments, and all Council members are familiar with these individuals. Councillor Sanders
said that the Rules clearly state that they should should first go before the committee.
Councillor Coleman moved, seconded by Councillor Lutz, to suspend the Rules and vote on these
reappointments this evening.

4

January 11, 2010

President Vaughn stated that the motion to refer the item to committee takes precedence over a
motion to suspend the Rules. Councillor Hunter asked why reappointments even need to be
considered, as the original appointments should change unless replacement is needed. He asked
if there is anything in the Rules requiring an appointment on an annual basis. Councillor Sanders
said that other appointments to various boards and committees come before the Council and
Council committees on an annual basis, and she believes the same should hold true for Council
staff. President Vaughn said that as a matter of expediency and convenience, he would rather
they vote on the issue tonight, but to be in strict compliance with the Council Rules, he would
encourage the support of referring the item to committee. Councillor Cockrum said that a couple
of years ago, the Council actually took a recess so that the committee could meet and consider the
appointments, and then the Council reconvened to consider the committee’s recommendation.
Councillor Sanders said that there is already a motion on the floor to refer the item to committee.
Councillor Cockrum moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, for a brief recess. The motion
carried on the following roll call vote; viz:
17 YEAS: Brown, Cain, Cardwell, Cockrum, Coleman, Day, Hunter, Lutz, Malone, McHenry,
McQuillen, Pfisterer, Plowman, Scales, Smith, Speedy, Vaughn
12 NAYS: Bateman, Evans, Gray, Lewis, MahernB, MahernD, Mansfield, Minton McNeill,
Moriarty Adams, Nytes, Oliver, Sanders

President Vaughn called for a 20-minute recess at 7:35 p.m. President Vaughn reconvened the
City-County Council at 7:55 p.m.
Councillor Lutz stated that the Rules and Public Policy Committee could not meet to make a
recommendation on the item, as there was not proper notification of the meeting. He stated that
the Rules and Public Policy Committee reviewed these appointments in January of 2008, and
there is nothing in the Rules to suggest the appointments need to be done on an annual basis. He
said that they did not review the appointments in 2009, and it is his understanding, that many
multiple year term appointments continue to stand until successors are appointed and qualified.
He said that if the Council wishes to refer the item to committee, however, he will be glad to take
up the discussion at the next meeting.
Councillor Sanders said that Sec. 151-100 of the Rules also repeats that the General Counsel is
appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Rules and Public Policy Committee,
subject to approval by the Council. She said that it does not specifically say these appointments
need to be done annually, but because it is silent on this matter does not automatically assume it
does not have to be done annually. She said that because these appointments are tied to the
leadership of the Council, and those elections take place annually, they should also occur
annually.
The Reappointment of Senior Staff was referred to committee on the following roll call vote; viz:
25 YEAS: Bateman, Brown, Cain, Cardwell, Day, Evans, Gray, Lewis, Lutz, MahernB,
MahernD, Malone, Mansfield, McHenry, McQuillen, Minton McNeill, Moriarty Adams,
Nytes, Oliver, Pfisterer, Plowman, Sanders, Smith, Speedy, Vaughn
4 NAYS: Cockrum, Coleman, Hunter, Scales

Councillor Hunter asked for consent to explain his vote. Consent was given. Councillor Hunters
said that many other board and committee appointments state that these individuals serve at the
pleasure of the body, and by the absence of this language, it does not imply that it should be done
annually.

January 11, 2010

WHEREAS, pursuant to Indiana Code § 36-3-3-8 and Section 103-73 of the “Revised Code of the
Consolidated City and County,” a mayoral appointment of a hearing officer to preside over the
administrative adjudication of parking citations on behalf of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and
Marion County is subject to the approval of the City-County Council; and
WHEREAS, the Mayor of the City of Indianapolis has submitted to this Council the name of
Darrell R. Fishel to serve as hearing officer at his pleasure for a term of one (1) year; now, therefore:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. Darrell R. Fishel is approved and confirmed by the City-County Council to serve as
hearing officer at the pleasure of the Mayor for the term of one (1) year.

Councillor Smith reported that the Metropolitan Development Committee heard Proposal Nos.
476-479, 2009 together. He asked for consent to vote on these proposals together. Councillor
Sanders asked to vote on the proposals separately.
PROPOSAL NO. 476, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Smith, reappoints Timothy
Ping to the Metropolitan Development Commission. By a 7-1 vote, the Committee reported the
proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor B. Mahern stated that a few months ago, there was a matter related to the development
of the Bank One Operations property, where a parking garage purchase for more than it was
worth was approved by the Metropolitan Development Commission (MDC). He said that he was
told the proper process, instead of getting involved in all of the deals the MDC is involved in, was
to work through the appointments made to the MDC, and therefore, he opposes this appointment.
Councillor Smith said that each appointee should be weighed individually, and not the committee
as a whole. He said that Councillor Mahern should look at Mr. Ping’s votes, as his are not always
a direct reflection of the outcome of an MDC decision. He said that Mr. Ping’s appointment
should not be tied to Councillor Mahern’s dissatisfaction with one decision the commission made.
Councillor Plowman said that while he agrees with the thought process of Councillor Mahern
regarding the Council having additional authority on some of these economic development deals,
that is not what this proposal is about, and Mr. Ping has served honorably and should not be used
as a pawn in this process.
Councillor Oliver said that he did not see the hearings but understood that Mr. Ping responded
that he did not think the deal was good for taxpayers, and therefore he will also rise against the
appointment.
Councillor Smith moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, for adoption. Proposal No. 476,
2009 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
16 YEAS: Cain, Cardwell, Cockrum, Day, Hunter, Lutz, Malone, McHenry, McQuillen, Nytes,

Neighborhood Associations (MCANA) regarding their feelings on appointments, and she cannot
find this report. Councillor Smith said that he does not have the report with him. Councillor
Malone stated that she looked at the report today, and the summation of that report seemed to be
not so much about the individuals, as it was about these individuals not just being a rubber stamp
and following staff recommendations. She said that the report does not necessarily reflect the
individuals, as some of them had voted against staff recommendations on some issues and in
coordination with the staff on others.

follows:
CITY-COUNTY GENERAL ORDINANCE NO. 1, 2010
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL ORDINANCE to establish a Division of Metropolitan Planning
Organization in the Department of Metropolitan Development.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND OF MARION COUNTY, INDIANA:
SECTION 1. Section 231-301 of the "Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County" regarding the
divisions of the Department of Metropolitan Development, as amended by G. O. No. 63, 2009, hereby is
amended by the deletion of the language that is stricken-through, and by the addition of the language that
is underscored, to read as follows:
Sec. 231-301. Divisions established.
The department of metropolitan development shall be composed of the following divisions:
(1) Division of neighborhood services;
(2) Division of planning;
(3) Division of administrative services;
(4) Division of community economic development; and
(5) Division of regional transportation authority.; and
(6) Division of metropolitan planning organization.
SECTION 2. Chapter 231 of the “Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County,” regarding the
Department of Metropolitan Development, hereby is amended by the addition of a NEW Section 231-308
establishing the division of metropolitan planning organization, to read as follows:
Sec. 231-308. Division of metropolitan planning organization.
(a) The division of metropolitan planning organization is responsible for staff activities of the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization, whose responsibilities and powers are defined by federal
regulations as “carrying out the metropolitan transportation planning process” in cooperation with the Indiana
Department of Transportation and local transit providers (23 CFR 450.312). The division will provide
administrative support for the Indianapolis Regional Transportation Council, the oversight body for the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization, including the development of annual or biannual work
programs, transportation improvement programs, conformity analyses, congestion management processes,
and other duties requested by the Indianapolis Regional Transportation Council or required by federal
regulations.
(b) This division shall have other powers and duties granted by statute or ordinance, or delegated by
the Indianapolis Regional Transportation Council.
SECTION 3. The expressed or implied repeal or amendment by this ordinance of any other ordinance or part
of any other ordinance does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred, or proceedings
begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Those rights, liabilities, and proceedings are continued, and
penalties shall be imposed and enforced under the repealed or amended ordinance as if this ordinance had not
been adopted.
SECTION 4. Should any provision (section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or any other portion) of this

19

Journal of the City-County Council

ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, the remaining
provision or provisions shall not be affected, if and only if such remaining provisions can, without the invalid
provision or provisions, be given the effect intended by the Council in adopting this ordinance. To this end
the provisions of this ordinance are severable.
SECTION 5. This ordinance shall be in effect from and after its passage by the Council and compliance with
Ind. Code § 36-3-4-14.

PROPOSAL NO. 481, 2009. Councillor Day reported that the Parks and Recreation Committee
heard Proposal No. 481, 2009 on December 17, 2009. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors
Day and Gray, authorizes public-private operating agreements by and between the Department of
Parks and Recreation and various business entities for the management and operation of cityowned golf courses. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the
recommendation that it do pass as amended.
Councillor Nytes thanked the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) for getting and keeping
the First Tee program here in Indianapolis, and she is pleased to see all golf courses participating.
Councillor Oliver said that some parks have been restored to attract new owners, but many other
parks still need restoration and maintenance, and he asked if other community programs will be
continued and expanded. Stuart Lowry, director of DPR, stated that the revenues are included in
the management contracts, and some of the parks had revenues for restoration, while others did
not. Partnering those non-revenue-generating parks with other courses and with programs such as
First Tee helps to give all courses revenues.
Councillor Coleman said that he is not a fan of the city being involved in the golf course business,
but he received some e-mails regarding certain bids netting more money for the city. Mr. Lowry
said that some bids exceeded the capital needed for the capital investment. He said with the
management contracts, those capital needs are borne by the operators, giving the city a very
strong return and insuring the courses remain in great shape.
Councillor Sanders asked if Pleasant Run and Sarah Shank courses are not party to these
contracts. Mr. Lowry said that they are part of the contract with Denny Ford and are part of the
proposal. Councillor Sanders asked about Eagle Creek. Mr. Lowry said that Eagle Creek is not
included because their contract does not end until 2014. Councillor Sanders asked Mr. Lowry to
provide an accounting as to how lucrative these contracts are for individuals. Mr. Lowry said that
he will provide Councillors with a revenue breakdown.
Councillor Speedy said that there have been lots of inquiries, and he investigated the process to
see that it was done adequately and fairly and is assured that it was. He said that there are eight
people who will be happy simply because their bids were not accepted. He added that even some
of those who won a bid may not be happy with aspects of their contracts, and it is simply
inevitable in a bid situation that not everyone will come out happy with the outcome. He said that
DPR followed the standard purchasing procedures and bidding process, and there was integrity in
the process.
Councillor Pfisterer said that everyone is aware that sometimes contracts can go awry in the
future, but there is strong language in these contracts with clawback clauses and termination for
non-compliance.
Councillor Day moved, seconded by Councillor McHenry, for adoption. Proposal No. 481, 2009
was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

                           Marion County, Indiana

                                2013 TAX SALE

                         Information and Procedures

  Please review the entire contents of this guide!

NOTE:  The Tax Sale item list will be available on the Treasurer’s web page
August 15th.
More information about this feature can be found on page 3 of this guide.



The following information and procedures apply to Marion County only.  The
statute governing tax sales in Indiana (I.C. 6-1.1-24 &25) affords the
County Auditor and County Treasurer options regarding the manner in which
the Tax Sale may be conducted.  Therefore, the exact procedures by which a
county conducts a tax sale for properties with delinquent taxes and special
assessments may differ from county to county.

This public auction or “Tax Sale” of real property is required by Indiana
law.  While some unfortunate circumstances may exist which result in some
properties being offered for sale, it is nonetheless required

           that all properties with delinquent taxes, penalties, and
           special assessment liens for unpaid sewer user charges,
           delinquent weed cutting fees, delinquent solid waste service
           fees, delinquent storm water fees, delinquent health and
           hospital liens, delinquent nuisance fees and DMD liens as
           specified by law, be auctioned at the Treasurer's Tax Sale.


The Tax Sale enables the Treasurer to collect the revenue that has been
levied for the operation of 42 governmental units and school districts
within Marion County. The staffs of the Marion County Treasurer and Marion
County Auditor appreciate the attention of prospective bidders and buyers
to the procedures governing this Tax Sale. Thank you for your
participation. Your comments are welcome.

                                                                       [pic]

5.  Eligible Parcels In Sale
Parcel Identification
The seven digit “parcel number” identifies a property and identifies the
exact property being offered. While the owner and/or common address is
advertised and/or read at the sale it is the parcel number that must be
used to establish the exact property and location.   All sales are final;
the bidder is responsible for determining the parcel location.

Item Number Order of Sale
Parcels will be offered for sale in Item Number sequence, as identified in
newspaper ads.” C” items will be offered first, followed by “A” items.
Every parcel has an item number and all item numbers start with either
“49A” or “49C” followed by the assigned numeric number.

Difference between “A” and “C” items
“C” items have a maximum redemption period of 120 days rather than the one-
year redemption that applies to “A” items.  There are no C items for this
years tax sale.

Combined Parcels
Combined parcels will be announced by the auctioneer.  A list of
combinations will be distributed before the sale and posted at
www.indy.gov/egov/county/treasurer/sale   The minimum price presented is
the total of charges on all the parcels that are combined.  Certain
parcels, usually abutting and/or for which they must be combined to offer
the entire improvement, have the same ownership and are sold together and
must be redeemed together.




List of Available Parcels
A complete list of Tax Sale items is available as follows:
Newspaper:  The list will appear in The Indianapolis Star and the Court &
Commercial Record.  It is updated for each advertisement and will be
published on the following Wednesdays:
                       July 31, 2013
                       August 7, 2013
                       August 14, 2013
CD:  A CD in Microsoft Excel format can be purchased for $20.00 from the
Treasurer’s office beginning July 31st.  The parcels list on the CD is the
same as that which appears in the most recent newspaper advertisement.
Web page:  Beginning Wednesday, July 31, 2013, a PDF file to view or
download will be available and is updated nightly.  The file is in the same
format as the newspaper list.  The Web address for viewing and/or
downloading is www.indy.gov/egov/county/treasurer/sale
Paper list:  A list of only the available item numbers is updated nightly
and can be purchased for $5.00 from the Treasurer’s office beginning
Wednesday, July 31st through the end of the tax sale.  Only the Tax Sale
Item Number will appear on the list, it is necessary to have one of the
original listings to be able to obtain other information about the parcels.

6.  All Sales Are Final!
All sales are final, if purchased there is no refund or exchange.  The
office of the Marion County Treasurer provides only the seven digit parcel
number and minimum bid amount for it.  Bidders are responsible for
determining any and all information regarding the parcel and its
suitability.  Bidders are urged to thoroughly research the available tax
sale properties to aid in identifying the exact piece of property
identified by the parcel number.  Research may include, but not necessarily
be limited to, a review of:

      liens recorded with the Marion County Recorder;
      plat maps in the County Assessor's office;
      orders of the Department of Metropolitan Development and/or Health
      and Hospital concerning demolition orders and unsafe buildings;
      sewer user charges, solid waste service fees, and/or weed cutting
      charges that have not been certified to the Treasurer by the
      Department of Public Works; and
      Health & Hospital charges that have not been certified to the
      Treasurer.
      Nuisance Fees by Department of Code Enforcement that have not been
      certified to the Treasurer.

If a successful bidder buys a “pig in a poke”, the buyer will get just
that.

7.  Bidding Procedure
Parcels will be offered in groups of 25 items such as items A1 through A25.
At time of sale some items will not be available; bidders should confirm an
item of interest is shown in the group.  Any registered bidder may call out
an item number within that range. A call for a specific item number is an
offer to purchase that item at the minimum advertised price. Once the
minimum bid is made, that item is auctioned to the highest bidder. Bid
paddles must be raised high to be visible to the auctioneer and should
remain up until no longer bidding.  Following the sale of an item another
item number within the group of 25 parcels can be called out and auctioned.
 This procedure continues until there is either no calls for item numbers
within the group or all items in the group have been auctioned.  At that
time, the next group of 25 item numbers will be offered.

Once bidding commences on a particular item number the bidding increments
will be set as deemed appropriate solely by the auctioneer based on the
number of bidders.

Minimum Bid
A call for a specific item number is an offer to purchase that item at the
minimum advertised price. The minimum bid is the total of all delinquent
taxes, penalties, and special assessments presently due on the parcel, the
2012 pay 2013 Fall taxes and special assessment fees (if any) and the
$450.00 Administrative Cost.
The Administrative Cost includes $267.00 for the advertising expenses, pre
sale title search and actual administrative costs and $183.00 for the after
Title Search Fee that is charged with each sale.  The Title Search enables
the Marion County Auditor to notify all interested parties of public record
that their office may be informed by the Auditor of the impending issuance
of a Tax Deed to a different owner. The title search remains the property
of the County Auditor.

Reoffer of Unsold Parcels
All unsold “A” parcels will be offered for sale again on the second day at
the conclusion of the first offering of parcels.

Full Payment Due the Day of Sale
Bidders must have the correct type of payment at the time of becoming a
successful bidder. A high bidder who fails to immediately pay the bid price
in acceptable funds must pay a penalty of 25% of the amount of the bid per
IC. 6-1.1-24-8.

8.  No Rights to Property During Redemption Period
A bidder is purchasing the tax lien; the tax lien buyer’s interest in the
property is limited to the tax lien until one of the following occurs: 1)
the property is redeemed, or 2) the redemption period has expired and the
court has approved the issuance of a Tax Deed by the County Auditor, or 3)
the tax lien buyer has not surrendered the lien to the County Auditor
within the prescribed 6 month period.

Redemption Period
Sold
“A” items:  one year period following the date of sale.
“C” items: 120 days following the date of sale.
Unsold
“A” items:  120 days following the date of sale.
“C” items: 120 days following the date of sale.

During the redemption period the delinquent owner, occupant, or person with
a substantial property interest of public record may “redeem the property”,
a term meaning to retain possession by paying all monies owed to the county
plus required fees, penalties and interest.  Redemption of the tax lien
sold at tax sale results in the parcel remaining in the current owner’s
name.

Tax sale buyers are trespassing if they attempt to enter the premises or
exercise any ownership rights during the redemption period and prior to the
Tax Deed being issued in the buyer’s name.

9.  Obtaining Tax Sale Certificate
Tax sale certificates are prepared by the Marion County Auditor and
approximately four weeks after the sale the Auditor’s office will notify
the lien buyer that the tax sale certificate is available.  The lien buyer
must present the tax sale receipt and photo ID to the Marion County
Auditor, Room 841 of the City-County Building, in order to receive a Tax
Certificate evidencing the buyer's lien against the property.

10.  Optional Payment of Taxes During Redemption Period
A Tax Sale buyer may pay any taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments
which become due on the parcel subsequent to the Tax Sale but before the
redemption period expires. Such payments can be made by requesting a bill
in person from the Marion County Treasurer and recording the payment with
the Marion County Auditor.

If the property is redeemed, the buyer will be reimbursed for recorded
payments of subsequent taxes, penalties, and/or special assessments plus
interest at the rate of 10% per annum.  It is the Tax Sale Buyer’s
responsibility to record any such payment in the Auditor’s office if the
buyer expects to be reimbursed when the property is redeemed.

11.  Title Transfer after Redemption Period
The property will be transferred to the successful tax sale bidder if the
owner does not redeem the property during the redemption period.  If the
property is not redeemed within the redemption period the Tax Sale buyer
may present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor and receive a Tax
Deed to the property granting title to the property to the buyer or
assignee of the buyer.

If the parcel is not redeemed and the Tax Sale buyer surrenders the Tax
Certificate to receive a Tax Deed, all delinquent taxes, penalties, and/or
special assessments which became due subsequent to the Tax Sale must be
paid before the Auditor will petition the court to issue a Tax Deed to the
Tax Sale buyer.

The Tax Sale buyer’s lien expires six (6) months after the expiration of
the redemption period.
If the tax lien buyer wants title to the property the lien buyer must
present the Tax Certificate to the County Auditor during the 6 month
period.  After 6 months the lien is void and worthless.

12.  Voided Sales
If, before redemption or the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the
sale is invalid, the Tax Sale buyer is not entitled to a Tax Deed, but
shall be entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus 6% per annum
interest.

If, after the execution of a Tax Deed, it is found that the deed is invalid
pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-25-12, the Tax Sale buyer is entitled to a lien on
the property in the amount of the purchase price, any taxes or special
assessments paid subsequent to sale, and any amount due the Tax Sale buyer
as an occupying claimant plus interest at 10% per annum.

13.  Statutory Payment to Lien Buyer of Redeemed Property
If a property is redeemed the Tax Sale lien buyer receives:

    A. On the Minimum bid:
      110% of the minimum bid if redeemed not more than 6 months after the
      date of sale, or
      115% of the minimum bid if redeemed more than 6 months but not more
      than one year after the      date of sale.


      B. On the difference between the successful bid price and the minimum
bid (referred to as Tax Sale
            Overbid):
      10% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of
      redemption.

      C.  On any taxes and special assessments paid by the Tax Sale buyer
subsequent to the sale:
      10% per annum interest from the date of payment to the date of
      redemption

A buyer who is to receive a payment as a result of redemption will be
required to complete Form W-9 if a signed form is not on file. The W-9
provides the County Auditor sufficient information to issue a 1099-INT for
the amount of interest and redemption fee received.

any reports on inmate re-entry. Ms. Hipple answered in the affirmative. She said that
she has a publication with Ed McGarrell based on Marion County inmate re-entry that
came out in 2002.
Councillor Nytes asked how many people are on this review team. Ms. Hipple said that
she is not sure. She said that she has been volunteering with this board since August
of 2010. She said that there are monthly meetings and there are 12 to 15 people that
attend regularly but then there are spaces for representatives from the Crime Lab, the
Coroner’s Office, the Prosecutor’s Office, IMPD and many other agencies.
Councillor Brown asked if Ms. Hipple has completed any research on juvenile crime
based recidivism. Ms. Hipple said that she was a part of a project where they looked at
juveniles who were first-time offenders. She said they followed them looking at
recidivism rates. She said that there are some things in the works that they are looking
at, including neighborhood disorder, census track data, and if the juveniles come from
single parent homes. Councillor Brown said that his opposition is only because Ms.
Hipple does not live in Marion County. He said that she has all the experience
necessary to sit on this board. Ms. Hipple said that she understands that concern.
Councillor Freeman thanked Ms. Hipple for volunteering to help with this board.
Chairman Lutz asked what the pay is for this position. Ms. Hipple said that there is no
pay for this position. She said that this board meets monthly, and she works from home
and would be able to attend the meetings.
Councillor Freeman moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, to send Proposal No. 5,
2011 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a
vote of 6-1, with Councillor Brown casting the negative vote.

Juvenile detention Alternative Initiative (JDAI) started in Indianapolis in 2006, as
a system reform effort focused on eliminating the overuse of secure detention.
JDAI is also focused on ensuring the right kid is detained.
JDAI’s focus in Marion County has created a Reception Center, re-engineered
the way Initial Hearing Court works, expanded alternatives of detention and
reduced the detention population.
The Reception Center started as a pilot project in 2007 in the northeast district
that involved low-risk youth entering into the system that needed some type of
diversion program that would provide those services.
Eligible offenses allowed at the Reception Center include status offenses, B and
C misdemeanors, shoplifting, and intra-family disputes as long as there are no
injuries.
The Initial Hearing Court approves filing of petitions based on probable cause
and the best interest of the child or the public.
There is a variety of Pre-trial Release Continuums and alternatives to Detention.
The 2010 promising outcomes include a 1.1 percent failure to appear rate, and a
13 percent re-offense rate on felonies and misdemeanors only.
The detention statistics show a 67.7 percent reduction in total admissions from
2000 to 2010.

Judge Chavers said that there has been a lot of interest by committee members in what
is going on at the Juvenile Court and the Juvenile Center.
Chairman Lutz asked what the daily cost to the taxpayer is to have a child in the
detention center. Ms. Ball said that the cost is approximately $200.00 per day.
Councillor Minton- McNeill asked if there is a cost to the kids on daily reporting or home
detention monitoring. Ms. Ball said that there is no cost to the families.
Councillor Brown asked who funds the cost for the programs and their equipment. Ms.
Ball said it varies by alternative. She said that some of the programs are funded by the
state and the Department of Children’s Services (DCS). She said they fund day
reporting, which is $80.00 a day, and shelter care, which is $130.00 per day. Ms. Ball
said that the evening reporting centers are paid out of the court budget, and they are
$25.00 per day. Judge Chavers said that the shelter care is for kids who do not have a
relative or parent that they can go to. The advantage of the shelter care facility over
keeping a child in the detention center is that they are transported to their home school.
Councillor Sandlin asked if someone is under the age of 16 and has been expelled from
school and there is no alternative, what will happen to that child. Judge Chavers said
that they would try to use programs such as the day reporting. He said that most of the
school systems do have various alternatives for expulsion.

Councillor McQuillen asked what the staff- to-youth ratio is at the Juvenile Center. Ms.
Ball said that she is not sure but she can get that information to the committee at a later
time.
Councillor Nytes asked if the Reach for Youth Teen Court Program is one of the
community based programs that some of the youth would be referred to. Ms. Ball
answered in the affirmative. She said that they defer a lot of the diversion cases to that
program. Judge Chavers said that these types of reforms have been able to keep the
detention center population down, and it has also enabled the Juvenile Court to be more
efficient. This also helps with the probation caseloads.
Ms. Ball invited all the committee members out to the facility to take a tour and see the
operations.
There being no further business, and upon motion duly made, the meeting was
adjourned at 6:17 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,
