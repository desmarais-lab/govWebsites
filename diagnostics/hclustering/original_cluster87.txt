Petitioner & County both made a few viable arguements showing vacancy & repair issues, however the County failed to make a prima facie case to sustain the
value, therefore in the Examiner's reveiw of submitted evidence, additional obs are applied for vacancy & repair issues, resulting in a reduced AV.

Petitioner & County both made a few viable arguements showing vacancy & repair issues, however the County failed to make a prima facie case to sustain the

Minutes:
Assessment Sustained: County burden was satisfied, as the increase came from a correction in acreage and adjustment of the lands influence factor, shifting the
burden back to the Petitioner. The Petitioner's Representative failed to make a prima facie case by submitting only one comp, and that is not similar in location;
one comp does not make a comparable.

Petitioner argued his additional parcel of which his home partially straddles, is legally deemed curtilage, and shall be recognized as primary to the home;
Petitioner is correct; all land remains under 1 acre, therefore the 1% cap shall apply to entire parcel, not the 3% cap. Additional argument regarding the land value
is unsupported, entire neighborhood on the same base rate, therefore no change in Assessed Value. Peitiioner is responsible to follow up with the District for any
due refund per the change in cap.

Exemption Disallowed. Per the Indiana Supreme Court decision in Oaken Bucket the property must be owned, occupied, and used for an exempt purpose. The
applicant has failed to show that the owner owned the property for an exempt purpose when only 11% of the building was rented to non-profits. Further, the
owner would have to show they had their own exempt purpose, seperate and independent of the non-profit tenants to receive an exempt, and no information was
provided which would show this was the owners intention.

Exemption Disallowed. Per the Indiana Supreme Court decision in Oaken Bucket the property owner must show they have their own exempt purpose indepedent
of the tenant. Failed to show meet the requirements under IC 6-1.1-10-16 of owning the property for a charitable purpose. Renting below market rent is not
enough to justify the loss in tax revenue

EXEMPTION DISALLOWED. Applicates burden to show fall under the statutory requirements for an exemption. Implicit in the requirement that education be the
"substantial equivalent" of instruction offered in Indiana's tax-supported insitutions is the notion that education benefits the public not the presenter. Dpt Local Gov
Finance v. Roller Skating Rink Operators Assoc. Education that primarily serves the private interest of an organization's members does not warrant public
subsidy. Roller Skating Rink Operators. Applicant supplies promotional literature, and the purposes and activities of the organization are advocacy and lobbying
activities to advance the interest of their members.

EXEMPTION DISALLOWED. Applicates burden to show fall under the statutory requirements for an exempt. Implicit in the requirement that education be the
"substantial equivalent" of instruction offered in Indiana's tax-supported insitutions is the notion that education benefits the public not the presenter. Dpt Local Gov
Finance v. Roller Skating Rink Operators Assoc. Education that primarily serves the private interest of an organization's members does not warrant public
subsidy. Roller Skating Rink Operators. "Programs of a trade association directed to the development of the private businesses of its members, though
"educational" in some sense, do not qualify for property tax exemption as educational activities." Roller Skating Rink

Corrected building square footage. Petitioner's request to have 842 square foot changed from primary to roadway. This is a subjective issue not objective. The
land in question is support land for the driveway to the parking garage and therefore is assessed as primary land.

multiple individuals views of value; the reduction(s) submitted by the County are accepted.

County Analyst met the burden by remaining consistent providing a prima facie case for the Assessed Value (AV), less the appealed AV; Petitioner/Rep
continued to disagree but failed to submit specific consistent subject evidence to support claims or warrant request for lesser AV, being less uniformed with
multiple individuals views of value; the reduction(s) submitted by the County are accepted.

Minutes:
County Analyst met the burden by remaining consistent providing a prima facie case for the Assessed Value (AV), less the appealed AV; Petitioner/Rep
continued to disagree but failed to submit specific consistent subject evidence to support claims or warrant request for lesser AV, being less uniformed with
multiple individuals views of value; the reduction(s) submitted by the County are accepted.

7171 E TWIN OAKS DR INDIANAPOLIS 46226
Per counsel: I.C. 6-1.1-12-37 provides that a homestead deduction, among other things, is provided to an individual who is “entitled to occupy as a tenant
stockholder (as defined in 26 USC 216) of a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in 26 USC 216).” These individuals who reside at these residences are
not tenant stockholders as defined by statute, thus, they are not entitled to a homestead deduction and no error has occurred. Assessment is sustained.

7171 E TWIN OAKS DR INDIANAPOLIS 46226
Per counsel: I.C. 6-1.1-12-37 provides that a homestead deduction, among other things, is provided to an individual who is “entitled to occupy as a tenant
stockholder (as defined in 26 USC 216) of a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in 26 USC 216).” These individuals who reside at these residences are
not tenant stockholders as defined by statute, thus, they are not entitled to a homestead deduction and no error has occurred. Assessment is sustained.
