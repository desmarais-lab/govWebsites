      An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission
      Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (&quot;TCP/IP&quot;) network, such as
      the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information
      based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address

      are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your
      computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to
      communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
