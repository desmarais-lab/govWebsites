settled, dismissed or resolved in some other manner, or an exigent case loses its exigent status, before the applicable
trial date, the parties will not be allowed to fill the newly vacant slot in the trial setting with another case.
D. C. This Court has determined that generally no more than eight cases shall be set for each trial setting. Of these

is only one or are no exigent cases for that trial setting.
2. All non-exigent cases are only tentatively set for trial, and are subject to displacement by cases that are rolled
over from the previous trial setting for the same plaintiffs' counsel.
3. This POST is intended to allow the parties to begin preparing the tentatively scheduled cases for trial and
alleviate the burden the parties bear in litigating entire cases in very short time frames.
F. E. Final order setting trial. -- No less than five months prior to a trial date, the parties shall submit to the Court a
proposed Final Order Setting Trial (FOST) for that trial date which confirms the cases set for trial pursuant to the trial

H. G. Stayed cases.
1. Definition and Designation of Stayed Cases. -- A "stayed case" is one that is currently not set for trial or one
that is not exigent under Rule 712. The stayed case designation shall be lifted automatically when the case is reached in
FIFO order and set on a POST of or FOST. Otherwise, a party may move the Court to lift the stayed case designation,
which the Court may order for good cause shown.
2. Effect of Stayed Status. -- No formal activity is required in a stayed case, other than the filing of plaintiffs'
pleadings, appearances, and the gathering of information provided in Rules 708(D) and 708(E). Those filings must be
made regardless of stayed status. Other filings are permitted by any party, but the time for response shall not begin until

for response is the time set forth in Rule 714.

Rule LR49-TR40-712. Exigent cases and expedited trial settings.

A. EXIGENT CASES.
1. "Exigent Case" shall mean the allegedly injured plaintiff has been diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma,
any other asbestos-related Stage IV condition, or can show other compelling circumstances that justifies deviating from
the strong presumption that all cases shall be handled in FIFO Order.
2. Any case that does not meet the definition of an "exigent case" shall be a non-exigent case. In the event the
plaintiff in an exigent case dies before the deadline to file summary judgments and the Court grants a party's motion to
remove the case from an expedited trial setting, the case will no longer be considered exigent for purposes of
establishing deadlines and trial settings.
3. To obtain exigent status and an expedited trial setting, a plaintiff must:
(a) File with the Court a Motion for Expedited Trial Setting showing good cause why the plaintiff should be
afforded the preferential treatment; and,
(b) Attach to The Motion for Expedited Trial Setting shall contain a statement that the Plaintiff has a confirmed
pathological diagnosis and/or clinical diagnosis of the disease mesothelioma or a stage IV cancer. The Motion shall
reference that the confirming medical documentation is available through counsel for plaintiff and/or Sims & Associates
and shall not be attached to the motion to maintain privacy of the medical documentation. an affidavit from a qualified
physician speaking to the deteriorating health of the plaintiff and indicating that the plaintiff meets the definition of
exigent. The qualified physician's affidavit must unequivocally state that the physician has read the Court's definition of
an "exigent case" and that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the plaintiff meets the Court's definition. In the
event that Plaintiff seeks exigent status on a basis other than the Plaintiff's serious medical conditions stated above,
Plaintiff shall attach a detailed affidavit that demonstrates facts supporting the need for an expedited trial date.
4. Following a Motion to Expedite Trial, the case shall proceed as if exigent pending the Court's ruling on that
Request
5. Plaintiff shall make all reasonable attempts to make the affiant available for deposition within thirty (30) days
of the filing of such affidavit. A deposition of the affiant for the purposes of challenging the exigent status will be
limited solely to the facts and circumstances surrounding the determination that Plaintiff qualifies for exigent status.
6. 5. Defendant(s) shall file any objection to Plaintiff(s) request for an exigent trial setting on or before 60 days
after the date of the Motion for Expedited Trial Setting was filed, or within 30 days of service upon that Defendant,
whichever is later.
7. 6. An exigent case shall remain exigent and receive expedited treatment only so long as:
(a) the Plaintiff remains living; or,
(b) the parties and the Court have invested substantial amounts of time and effort in preparing the case for trial
and the deadline for filing motions for summary judgment has passed such that in the interest of judicial economy the
case should continue to receive expedited treatment and remain in place on the upcoming trial calendar.
8. 7. At no time will an expedited trial setting be granted for any exigent case less than eight months after the date
on which plaintiff requests the exigent status and expedited trial setting.
9. 8. This Rule is only for the purposes of determining trial setting priority, and designation of a case as "exigent"
shall not constitute evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by or related to asbestos.

delinquency. In case the Lessee shall in good faith desire to contest the validity of any such tax
or assessment, and shall so notify the Lessor, and shall furnish bond with surety to the approval
of the Lessor conditioned for the payment of the charges so desired to be contested and all
damages or loss resulting to the Lessor from the nonpayment thereof when due, the Lessee shall
not be obligated to pay the same until such contests shall have been determined. The Lessee
shall pay as further rental the amount calculated by or for Lessor as the amount required to be
rebated or paid as a penalty in lieu of rebate to the United States Treasury, after taking into
account other available moneys, to prevent the Bonds issued to refinance the BANs from

4

becoming arbitrage obligations under Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.
4.

Abatement of Rent. In the event the Leased Premises shall be partially or totally

destroyed, whether by fire or any other casualty, or are taken under the exercise of the power of
eminent domain, so as to render them unfit, in whole or part, for use or occupancy by the Lessee,
it shall then be the obligation of the Lessor to restore and rebuild the Leased Premises as
promptly as may be done, unavoidable strikes and other causes beyond the control of the Lessor
excepted; provided, however, that the Lessor shall not be obligated to expend on such restoration
or rebuilding more than the amount of the proceeds received by the Lessor from the insurance
provided for in Section 6 hereof or the condemnation proceeds received by the Lessor,
whichever is applicable.
If there is in force on the date of partial or total destruction or taking, insurance on the
Leased Premises and the rental value thereof, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6
hereof, the rent shall be abated for the period during which the Leased Premises or any part
thereof are unfit or unavailable for occupancy and shall be in proportion to the percentage of
floor area which is unfit or unavailable for occupancy.
5.

Maintenance, Alterations and Repairs. The Lessee assumes all responsibility for

maintenance, repairs and alterations to the Leased Premises. At the end of the term, Lessee shall
deliver the Leased Premises to Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term,
reasonable wear and tear only excepted. Equipment or other personal property which becomes
worn out or obsolete may be discarded or sold by Lessee. The proceeds of the sale of any
personal property shall be paid to the Trustee. Lessee may trade in any obsolete or worn out
personal property or replacement property which replacement property will belong to Lessee

5

upon payment to the Trustee of an amount equal to the trade-in value of such property. Lessee
need not replace worn out or obsolete personal property, but may replace such property at its
own expense, and the replacement property shall belong to Lessee.
6.

Insurance. Lessee, at its own expense, will, during the full BAN Term of the

Lease and the full Bond Term of the Lease, keep the Leased Premises insured against physical
loss or damage, however caused, with such exceptions as are ordinarily required by insurers of
buildings or facilities of a similar type, with good and responsible insurance companies
acceptable to Lessor. Such insurance shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) one hundred
percent (100%) of the full replacement cost of the Leased Premises; or (ii) one hundred percent
(100%) of the redemption price of the outstanding bonds on the effective date of such insurance
and on or before April 1 of each year thereafter as certified by the Lessor Representative (as
defined in the Indenture). During the full BAN Term of this Lease and the full Bond Term of
this Lease, Lessee will also, at its own expense, maintain rent or rental value insurance in amount
equal to the full rental value of the Leased Premises for a period of two (2) years against physical
loss or damage of the type insured against pursuant to the preceding requirements of this clause.
During the full BAN Term of this Lease and the full Bond Term of this Lease, Lessee will also,
at its own expense, carry combined bodily injury insurance, including accidental death, and
property damage with reference to the Leased Premises in an amount not less than Three Million
Dollars ($3,000,000) on account of each occurrence with one or more good and responsible
insurance companies. The public liability insurance required herein may be by blanket insurance
policy or policies.
The proceeds of the public liability insurance required herein (after payment of expenses
incurred in the collection of such proceeds) shall be applied toward extinguishment or

6

satisfaction of the liability with respect to which such insurance proceeds are paid. Such policies
shall be for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the Leased Premises, and shall
be made payable to the Lessor or to such other person or persons as the Lessor may designate.
Such policies shall be countersigned by an agent of the insurer who is a resident of the State of
Indiana, and such policies (or certificates of insurance for each policy) shall be deposited with
the Lessor. If, at any time, the Lessee fails to maintain insurance in accordance with this
Section, such insurance may be obtained by the Lessor and the amount paid therefor shall be
added to the amount of rental payable by the Lessee under this Lease; provided, however, that
the Lessor shall be under no obligation to obtain such insurance and any action or non-action of
the Lessor in this regard shall not relieve the Lessee of any consequence of its default in failing
to obtain such insurance, including its obligation to continue the rental payments in case of total
or partial destruction of the buildings as provided in Section 4 hereof.
7.

Eminent Domain. If title to or the temporary use of the Leased Premises, or any

part thereof, shall be taken under the exercise of the power of eminent domain by any
governmental body or by any person, firm or corporation acting under governmental authority,
any net proceeds received from any award made in such eminent domain proceedings (after
payment of expenses incurred in such collection) shall be paid to and held by Lessor.
Such proceeds shall be applied in one or more of the following ways:
(a)

The restoration of the Leased Premises to substantially the same condition as it
existed prior to the exercise of said power of eminent domain, or

(b)

The acquisition, by construction or otherwise, of other improvements suitable for
the Lessee’s operations on the Leased Premises and which are in furtherance of
the purposes of Indiana Code, Title 36, Article 1, Chapter 10 (which

7

improvements shall be deemed a part of the Leased Premises and available for use
and occupancy by the Lessee without the payment of any rent other than as herein
provided, to the same extent as if such other improvements were specifically
described herein and demised hereby).
Within ninety (90) days from the date of entry of a final order in any eminent domain
proceedings granting condemnation, the Lessee shall direct Lessor in writing as to which of the
ways specified in this Section the Lessee elects to have the net proceeds of the condemnation
award applied.

Any balance of the net proceeds of the award in such eminent domain

proceedings not required to be applied for the purposes specified in subsections (a) or (b) above
shall (i) during the BAN Term be applied to repayment of the BANs and (ii) during the Bond
Term be deposited by Lessor in the Sinking Fund held by the Trustee under the Indenture.
Lessor shall cooperate fully with the Lessee in the handling and conduct of any
prospective or pending condemnation proceedings with respect to the Leased Premises or any
part thereof and will to the extent it may lawfully do so permit the Lessee to litigate in any such
proceedings in its own name or in the name and on behalf of the Lessor. In no event will Lessor
voluntarily settle or consent to the settlement of any prospective or pending condemnation
proceedings with respect to the Leased Premises or any part thereof without the written consent
of the Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
8.

General Covenants. The Lessee shall not assign this Lease or sublet the Leased

Premises herein described without the written consent of Lessor. Lessee shall use and maintain
the Leased Premises in accordance with the laws and ordinances of the United States of America,
the State of Indiana, and all other proper governmental authorities.

Except as hereinafter

provided in this Section 8, the Lessee covenants that in any contracts entered into by the Lessee

8

providing for the use of the Leased Premises, which involve the conduct of a separate trade or
business, (a) the Leased Premises would be used only (i) by a Governmental Unit within the
meaning of Section 141 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) or (ii) by nonGovernmental Units on the same basis as other members of the general public or (b) would not
in the aggregate result in payments to the Lessee in an amount in excess of 5% of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds issued under the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8
to the contrary, the Lessor consents to and agrees to the sub-letting of the Leased Premises by
Lessee to Volunteers of America of Indiana, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization under the Code,
during either or both of the BAN Term and the Bond Term for use of the Leased Premises as a
social service facility to provide drug addiction treatment to inhabitants in and around the City of
Winchester, Indiana.
9.

Option to Renew. Lessor hereby grants to Lessee the right and option to renew

this Lease for a further like or lesser term upon the same or like conditions as herein contained,
and applicable to the portion of the premises for which the renewal applies, and Lessee shall
exercise this option by written notice to Lessor given upon any rental payment date prior to the
expiration of this Lease.
10.

Option to Purchase. Lessor hereby grants to Lessee the right and option, on any

rental payment date, upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to Lessor, to purchase the Leased
Premises at a price equal to the amount required to enable Lessor to liquidate by paying all
indebtedness, including all premiums payable on the redemption thereof and accrued and unpaid
interest, and by paying the expenses and charges of liquidation. In no event, however, shall such
purchase price exceed the capital actually invested in such property by Lessor represented by
outstanding securities or existing indebtedness plus the cost of transferring the property and

9

liquidating the Lessor. The phrase “capital actually invested” as used herein shall be construed
to include, but not by way of limitation, the following amounts expended by the Lessor:
organization and incorporation expenses, financing costs, carry charges, legal fees, architects’
fees and reasonable costs and expenses incidental thereto.
Upon request of the Lessee made not less than sixty (60) days prior thereto, the Lessor
agrees to furnish an itemized statement setting forth the amount required to be paid by the Lessee
on the next rental payment date in order to purchase the Leased Premises in accordance with the
preceding paragraph. Upon the exercise of the option to purchase granted herein, Lessor will
upon payment of the option price deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Lessee documents
conveying to the Lessee all of the Lessor's title to the property being purchased, as such property
then exists, subject to the following: (i) those liens and encumbrances (if any) to which title to
said property was subject when conveyed to Lessor; (ii) those liens and encumbrances created by
the Lessee or to the creation or suffering of which the Lessee consented, and liens for taxes or
special assessments not then delinquent; and (iii) those liens and encumbrances on its part
contained in this Lease.
In the event of purchase of the Leased Premises by the Lessee or conveyance of the same
to the Lessee, the Lessee shall procure and pay for all surveys, title searches, abstracts, title
policies and legal services that may be required, and shall furnish at the Lessee’s expense all
documentary stamps or tax payments required for the transfer of title.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to provide that Lessee shall be under any
obligation to purchase the Leased Premises, or under any obligation in respect to the creditors,
shareholders, or security holders of the Lessor.

10

11.

Transfer to Lessee. In the event the Lessee has not exercised its option to renew

in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 hereof, and has not exercised its option to
purchase the Leased Premises in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof, and upon
the full discharge and performance by the Lessee of its obligations under this Lease, the Leased
Premises shall thereupon become the absolute property of the Lessee and upon the Lessee’s
request, Lessor shall execute proper instruments conveying to the Lessee all of Lessor’s title
thereto.
12.

Defaults. If the Lessee shall default (a) in the payment of any rentals or other

sums payable to the Lessor hereunder, or in the payment of any other sum herein required to be
paid for the Lessor; or (b) in the observance of any other covenant, agreement or condition
hereof, and such default shall continue for sixty (60) days after written notice to correct the
same; then, in any or either of such events, the Lessor may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights by suit or suits in equity or at law in any court of competent jurisdiction, whether for
specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein, or for the enforcement of
any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy; or the Lessor, at its option, without further
notice, may terminate the estate and interest of the Lessee hereunder, and it shall be lawful for
the Lessor forthwith to resume possession of the Leased Premises and the Lessee covenants to
surrender the same forthwith upon demand.
The exercise by the Lessor of the above right to terminate this Lease shall not release the
Lessee from the performance of any obligation hereof maturing prior to the Lessor’s actual entry
into possession. No waiver by the Lessor of any right to terminate this Lease upon any default
shall operate to waive such right upon the same or other default subsequently occurring.

11

13.

Notices. Whenever either party shall be required to give notice to the other under

this Lease, it shall be sufficient service of such notice to deposit the same in the United States
mail, in an envelope duly stamped, registered and addressed to the other party or parties at the
following addresses:

(a) to Lessor:

paragraph of Section 2 hereof.
Lessor and Lessee may by notice given hereunder, designate any further or different
addresses to which subsequent notices, certificates, requests or other communications shall be
sent.
14.

Successors or Assigns. All covenants of this Lease, whether by Lessor or Lessee,

shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the respective parties hereto.
15.

Construction of Covenants. Lessor was organized for the purpose of renovating

and erecting buildings and leasing the same to Lessee under the provisions of Indiana Code, Title
36, Article 1, Chapter 10. All provisions herein contained shall be construed in accordance with
the provisions of said statutes, and to the extent of inconsistencies, if any, between the covenants
and agreements in this Lease and the provisions of said statutes, said statutes shall be deemed to
be controlling and binding upon Lessor and Lessee.

Gary, Indiana 46402

9. REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTNER ENTITES
Procedures and process requirements are applied universally; however, stipulated below are
exceptions to address emergency requests that require deadline modifications to accommodate the
needs of other entities within the City of Gary that are partners in economic development (e.g.
Gary Economic Development Corporation, City of Gary, Regional Development Authority, GaryChicago International Airport). Though the Commission may modify its deadline and timeline to

-9-

accommodate or facilitate growth development, comprehensive documentation is non-negotiable.
All packages to the Commission must be detailed, comprehensive, and complete.
1. Economic development partners seeking Commission assistance must provide a written
notification via e-mail or standard mail at the earliest possible date relative to the possibility of a
request for financial assistance. Early notification provides the Commission and Administrator
with ample time to examine its budget, capacity to participate, perform comprehensive due
diligence, and review economic impact, job creation potential and project feasibility.
2. In addition to TIF funding from time to time, the Commission may be asked to: purchase,
acquire, sell, or donate properties; assign or execute professional service contracts; co-sign or
endorse projects or applications for funding.
3. City of Gary projects managed through the Board of Public Works and Safety may require TIF
funds for capital improvements and other related expenses. In advance of securing any contractors
or services that require TIF funding, the Board of Works must submit a written one-page request
via e-mail or standard mail to the Administrator to inquire about availability of funds. The
Administrator will then provide a City Request for TIF Funding form. Once approved, each
project must be bid out through the Board of Works. The Board of Works will then submit a
recommendation to the Commission with all supporting documents, a copy of each bid, and a
written recommendation signed by the Board of Works. Following the Board of Public Works and

ARTICLE III – PROCUREMENTAND FINANCE
The following lists the processes employed by the Gary Redevelopment Commission for
procurement of services to the commission by vendors and contractors. These processes are
governed by Indiana state statutes (IC 36-1-12, IC 36-1-9, IC 36-7-14)
1. SEALED BID PROCESS
Competitive sealed bids are solicited through print advertising, per state statute (IC 36-7-14). A
fixed price contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder whose bid conforms to all
the material terms and conditions of the bid invitation and technical specifications. The contract
award may be a fixed sum, or a unit price with a ceiling. All sealed bids are opened at a public
meeting per statute (IC 36-7-14) and directed to staff for review and subsequent recommendation.
The following procedures apply:
1. Prepare bid specifications: Specifications include complete and accurate descriptions including
technical requirements, and services provided.
2. Obtain Davis-Bacon wage decision: If the project has been determined to require Davis-Bacon
wages, secure the application.
3. Prepare the project bid terms and contracts: Standard contract language is used as a template to
ensure all necessary statutory requirements are observed.
4. Request to advertise: The Redevelopment Commission approves the staff’s request to publicly
procure bids for the project.
5. Publication: Per statute, each bid is published in two newspapers of record in addition to being
posted on the City of Gary’s website. The advertisement is subject to the relevant statute to
determine the frequency of publication and the time frame it must run. The advertisement should:
a. Include the place and date where bid packages are available
b. Include the place, date, and time fixed for receiving bids
c. Include bonding, certification, licensing requirements
d. For Davis-Bacon projects, specify the project is subject to prevailing wages
6. Amendments to bid documents (including revisions to wage rates): Amendments to the bid
documents must be sent to all potential bidders who obtained the original bid documents via email and Standard Mail.

-12-

7. Bid opening: Per statute (IC 36-7-14) all bids are opened at a public meeting held by the Gary
Redevelopment Commission. A bid tabulation sheet is completed showing the name and bid price
of each bidder, and whether the bid was responsive. The bids are then referred to staff for further
review and recommendation
8: Review: Staff reviews each packet to ensure all licensing requirements are met and the bid is
responsive to the specifications set forth in the bid package. The Redevelopment Commission’s
counsel reviews all recommendations made by staff prior to a formal recommendation going
before the Commission for a vote at the next regular meeting.
9. Bids exceeding project budget: If all bids exceed the amount budgeted for a project, the
Commission can negotiate with the lowest bidder to bring the contract within the budget limits. A
recommendation can be made to reject all bids, provide needed funds from other sources, or reallocate award funds. If the Commission has reason to believe that available funds are likely to be
inadequate for the full scope of work proposed, the Commission may request deductible
alternatives so the project can proceed without a second bid solicitation. If deductible alternatives
are requested, the document must specify the method and order in which deductible alternatives
will be applied in determining the low bid.
10. License and bonding requirements: The successful bidder must meet all bonding and licensing
requirements prescribed by state and local law.
2. COMPETITVE PROPOSAL (RFP) PROCESS
The competitive negotiation method should be used for all procurement of professional services
and select demolition procurement. Under this scenario, the Commission prepares a formal
Request for Proposals (RFP) and requests proposals from at least three (3) or more qualified firms
or individuals.
The following procedures apply:
1. Prepare the RFP: The RFP must not be prepared or solicited by those firms or individuals
submitting proposals, rather, a letter of request will be sent by staff. The RFP will include:
a. Scope of services
b. Time requirements/term of service
c. Proposal instructions
d. Federal, state, and local regulations applicable to the award
e. Further considerations not pertaining to scope of work that should be
considered when submitting a proposal

-13-

2. Solicit for proposals: Proposals must be solicited from at least three (3) qualified sources to
allow reasonable competition in the form of a written letter. This letter may be emailed in addition
to mailed in hard copy for more expedient responses.
3. Evaluation: When proposals are received, each shall be evaluated by the Commission staff
based on the following criteria:
a. Experience or technical expertise of the firm and its personnel in connection
with the type of services to be provided
b. Past record of performance on similar contracts within the State of Indiana
c. Capacity of the firm to perform the work within deadlines, taking into account
workload
d. Price
e. Status as a Gary-owned business pursuant to local ordinance
f. Eligibility as MBE/WBE (contingent upon funding source requirements)
g. Compliance with debarment requirements pursuant to State Board of Accounts
The review process is conducted by the Commission staff having the appropriate technical
expertise to make assessments and evaluations. No staff members with conflicts of interest such
as family relationships, close friendships, or business partnerships outside of the appropriate
course of government work shall participate in the evaluation process. Award recommendation
will be to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the project, considering
the established criteria. When award is made to a responsible bidder not having the lowest price,
the Commission shall document its reasons for not selecting the lowest proposed price.
4. Award: Staff prepares a memo recommending award to the Commission. The Commission
accepts or defers award at a public meeting by vote, pursuant to Commission by-laws.
5. Establish a professional contract file: The Commission shall maintain a contract file containing
the following:
a. Copy of all documents associated with public procurement including any
meeting minutes or resolutions of the Commission, correspondence with bidders,
and any proposals or responses to the RFQ/RFP.
b. Contract
3. SOLE SOURCE PURCHASES:
Non-competitive proposals may be used only when the other two (2) methods are not feasible,
and award files must document such a determination. When utilizing this method of procurement
a written scope of services is required. Non-competitive negotiation may only be used in one (1)
of the following circumstances:
-14-

1. Public urgency will not permit delay for competitive solicitation;
2. The item or service is available from only one (1) source;
3. After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
4. CONTRACTOR VERIFICATION
Suspended or debarred contractors are prohibited from participating in Redevelopment
Commission work. Prior to any bid award, Commission staff shall verify that no debarred or
suspended contractor receives a contract award. This verification shall be accomplished by
performing a search at www.sam.gov to determine if the apparent bid awardee is debarred or
suspended. Search results shall be attached to all contracts. No contract shall be executed without
this verification.
5. INSURANCE, LICENSES, AND BONDING
Successful bidders shall be required to provide proof of adequate insurance and a license with the
City of Gary. The value of property insurance must be, at a minimum, for the replacement value
of the property. For any construction of demolition contracts, a bid bond is also established,
commensurate with the scope of services indicated in bid specifications.
6. CONFLICT OF INTEREST
No employee, officer or agent of the award recipient may participate in selection, awarding, or
administration of a contract. Such a conflict would arise when one (1) of the following has a
financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award:
a. An employee, officer or agent;
b. Any member of his or her immediate family;
c. His or her partner; or
d. An organization that employs, or is about to employ, any of the above.
The award recipient’s officers, employees, or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities,
favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subrecipients.
7. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
All procurement procedures adhere to Indiana statutory guidelines. To the extent any procurement
should deviate from the written procedures contained herein, all Commission decisions default to
statutory requirements set forth in IC 36-7-14.
-15-

8. INTERNAL CONTROLS POLICY
This internal controls policy is uniform across the City of Gary for all agencies as instructed by
State Board of Accounts. The language and formatting is consistent with the City of Gary, as was
submitted to the Gary Common Council. The Commission adheres to the same policy as applied
below.
Policy. The purpose of this policy is to communicate the Common Council's internal control
objectives to all employees and elected officials of the City of Gary and to firmly commit the City
to the seventeen (17) key principles of internal controls as established by the Indiana State Board
of Accounts.
1. Control Environment
Principle 1: The oversight body and management demonstrate a commitment to integrity and
ethical values.
The City has the responsibility to establish and maintain an adequate system of internal control
and to furnish to the Gary Common Council, various boards and commissions, governmental
agencies, creditors and others reliable financial information on a timely basis. An adequate system
of internal control is necessary for the City to discharge these responsibilities.
Controls help ensure that assets are not exposed to unauthorized access and use, transactions are
properly recorded in the financial records, and the resultant financial information is reliable.
External organizations and stakeholders of the City rely on financial information to make
decisions toward appropriations, loans and other debt, grants, and other contractual relationships.
City resources are dependent upon the system of internal control. State auditors are required
annually to report upon the adequacy of the City’s systems for control over financial reporting
and compliance per IC 5-11-1-27(e). The safeguarding of City assets and the reliability which the
City and others can place upon its financial records is dependent upon the effectiveness of the
internal control process.
As the fiscal body, Common Council expects the City administration to effect an internal control
environment with policies and procedures necessary to provide reasonable assurance that
practices cause effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.
The system of internal control is meant to keep the City on course toward its mission and to
minimize surprises. The system promotes efficiency, minimizes risks of asset loss, helps ensure
-16-

the reliability of financial information, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations.
Internal control is a process; a means to an end, and not an end unto itself. The control
environment is the foundation upon which all components of internal control are based. It sets the
tone for City operations. Internal control is about people, operations, communications, and the
work environment. It is not about policies and forms though it takes shape through the
implementation of relevant policies, procedures, and practices. Internal control can provide
reasonable assurance, but no system of control can provide absolute assurance to the Common
Council and other users of financial information.
The Finance Department shall be charged with:
• Conveying periodic messages of the City’s internal control philosophy and expectations to
all employees;
• Evaluating the City’s internal control system for weaknesses on a periodic (but no less
frequently than annual) basis, providing solutions to any discovered weaknesses, and
inform employees of necessary changes in procedures;
• Working with the Human Resources Department to establish a confidential reporting
system for individuals to report suspected fraud and abuse of internal control policies; and
• Working with the Human Resources Department to institute procedures to address
violations of policies and consequences for violations.
Principle 2: The oversight body oversees the entity’s internal control system.
As the fiscal body for the City, the Common Council is responsible for setting the institutional
expectations for internal control, ensuring management is aware of those expectations, requiring
the upward communications channels are open through all levels of management, and evaluating
management’s effectiveness toward monitoring the control environment and implementing sound
control policies and procedures. As the City’s Chief Fiscal Officer, the Controller will be the
Common Council’s chief agent in implementing and managing the internal control policies and
procedures.
Principle 3: Management establishes an organizational structure, assigns responsibility, and
delegates authority to achieve the entity’s objectives.
Individuals with delegated approval authority, e.g. Elected Officials and Department Heads are
responsible for establishing, maintaining, and supporting a system of internal controls within their
areas of responsibility and for creating the control environment that encourages compliance with
City policies and procedures with the assistance of the Internal Control Team.

-17-

Adequate supervision is necessary to monitor that internal controls are operating as intended, and
to help ensure the reliability of accounting and operational controls by pointing out errors,
omissions, exceptions, and inconsistencies in procedures. Staff in leadership roles are responsible
for the application of this policy and the design, development, implementation, and maintenance
of systems of internal controls focusing on the effectiveness of operations and the safeguarding of
assets within their respective areas of responsibility. All levels of management and supervision
are responsible for strengthening internal controls when weaknesses are detected. Department
managers should periodically review departmental procedures to ensure that the general principles
of internal control are being followed.
The Finance Department has the primary responsibility for internal control over financial
reporting and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Controller is the City’s
chief source for information and assistance to staff and Department Heads on this topic and will
make resources available to assist in administering this policy via the Internal Control Team.
The Human Resources Department is responsible for internal controls over employee recruitment,
hiring, separation, promotion, job classification, employee rights, employee evaluations, and
salary administration. The Human Resources Director and Corporation Counsel are the City
sources for information and assistance on this topic and will make resources available to assist in
administering this policy.
All levels of internal control are subject to examination by internal and external auditors and the
internal controls team who are required to report on the adequacy of internal controls over finance
and compliance.
Department Heads are responsible for prompt corrective action on all internal control findings and
recommendations made by internal and external auditors. The audit process is completed only
after Department Heads receive the audit results and take action to correct internal control
weaknesses, improve systems, or demonstrate that management action is not warranted.
Department Heads have the responsibility to ensure that those who report to them have adequate
knowledge, skills, and abilities to function within, and contribute to, an effective internal control
environment. This includes providing access to appropriate training on topics relevant to their job
responsibilities.
Principle 4: Management demonstrates a commitment to recruit, develop, and retain competent
individuals.
The City Employee Handbook provides a roadmap for recruiting and maintaining quality
employees. Prior to employment individuals may be subject to pre-employment background
screening and/or a credit history check. While employed City Employees are entitled to a benefits
package including Health and Disability Insurance and certain other Post-Employment Benefits.
-18-

The City will continue to assess the best recruitment pools and tools for the different skill sets of
skills necessary to adequately implement and maintain quality internal controls.
Job descriptions will be updated where necessary to reflect internal control responsibilities and
duties. Employees will be regularly trained in internal control methods and all training will be
documented in employees’ personnel files. Employees will be regularly evaluated by their
supervisors on internal control duties and receive feedback on possible improvements.
Principle 5: Management evaluates performance and holds individuals accountable for their
internal control responsibilities.
Individuals are held accountable for their internal control responsibilities through a recognized
structure which includes relevant job descriptions, operating procedures, periodic employee
evaluations, regular feedback, and a progressive disciplinary policy. Additionally, City
Administration seeks to address issues in specific departments and positions through regular oneon-ones with Department Heads.
2. Risk Assessment
Principle 6: Management defines objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and risk
tolerances.
Through the creation of standard operating procedures and accurate organizational reporting
charts management conveys and identifies objectives, missions, policies, and risk tolerances to
employees. The Finance Department will lead a risk analysis of three major areas:
1. The effectiveness and efficiency of operations.
2. The reliability of reporting for internal and external use.
3. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
For each category, the Finance Department, with assistance from the internal controls team, will
define objectives in specific measurable terms in order to enable the design of internal control for
related risk, increase understanding at all levels, assess performance, identify what is to be
achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, when it will be achieved and incorporate
external requirements.
Principle 7: Management identifies, analyzes, and responds to risks related to achieving the
defined objectives.
The Finance Department will identify, analyze and respond to the risks identified in Principle 6
by determining:
1. How likely is the risk to occur?
2. How will it impact the objective?
-19-

3. Is the risk based on complex or unusual transactions?
4. Is the risk based on fraud?
Once each risk has been identified and analyzed, the Finance Department will work with
Department Heads to determine how to respond to each risk with a specific solution and action.
Principle 8: Management considers the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and
responding to risks.
Management is committed to fraud prevention by utilizing a “trust but verify” approach. The
potential for fraud, misappropriation, and outright theft are contemplated as controls are designed
for various City divisions. Fraud responses will include statutorily required responses to fraud,
including, but not limited to IC 5-11-1-27(1) relating to the Report of Misappropriation of Funds
to State Board of Accounts and Prosecuting Attorney and IC 5-11-1-27(j) relating to the Report of
Material Variances, Losses, Shortages or Thefts to the State Board of Accounts.
Principle 9: Management identifies, analyzes, and responds to significant changes that could
impact the internal control system.
The Finance Department, with the assistance of the internal control team, in coordination with
Department Heads, will regularly evaluate and adjust internal control policies in order to
accommodate for the impact of future changes, including but not limited to, personnel changes,
newly elected officials, new programs, new technology, new laws and regulations, and financial
fluctuations.
3. Control Activities
Principle 10: Management designs control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks.
The Finance Department will establish and maintain a system of internal controls that satisfies the
City’s objectives in the following categories:
• Risks are identified and effectively managed
• Safeguarding of City assets
• Reliability and integrity of financial information
• Compliance with City policy, plans, procedures, laws and regulations
• Economical and efficient use of City resources
• Meeting established objectives and goals for City operations and programs.
A.

General internal control principles for Departments are:
1. Separation of duties
-20-

a.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Duties are separated so that one person's work routinely serves as a check on
another's work.
b.
No one person has complete control over more than one key function or
activity (e.g., originating, authorizing, approving, certifying, disbursing,
receiving, or reconciling).
Authorization and approval
a.
Proposed transactions are authorized when proper and consistent with City
policy and the department's plans.
b.
Transactions are approved by the person who has delegated approval authority,
which is usually delegated on the basis of special competency or knowledge.
Custodial and security arrangements, i.e., Capital Assets.
a.
Responsibility for physical security/custody of City assets is separated from
record keeping/accounting for those assets.
b.
Unauthorized access to City assets and institutional data is prevented.
Timely and accurate review and reconciliation
a.
Departmental accounting records and documents are examined by employees
who have sufficient understanding of the City accounting and financial systems
to verify that recorded transactions actually took place and were made in
accordance with City policies and procedures.
b.
Departmental accounting records and documentation are compared with City accounting system reports and financial statements to verify their
reasonableness, accuracy, and completeness.
The general internal control principles should be applied to all departmental
operations,
especially
accounting
records
and
reports,
payroll,
purchasing/receiving/disbursement approval, equipment and supply inventories, cash
receipts, petty cash and change funds, billing, accounts receivable and capital assets.

B.

All City systems, processes, operations, functions, and activities are subject to evaluations
to determine whether they comply with internal control standards. The results of these
evaluations provide information regarding the City’s overall system of control.

C.

Information and communication — Information must be timely and communicated in a
manner that enables people to carry out their responsibilities.
1. All covered employees must be trained on Internal Controls according to IC 511-127(g).
All personnel must receive a clear message from the City’s administration that control
responsibilities are to be taken seriously. Failure to comply with established practices
will subject individuals to the terms of disciplinary action or dismissal.
2. Employees must understand their own roles in the internal control system, as well as
how individual activities relate to the work of others. To this end, whenever a new
-21-

3.
4.

D.

budgetary unit, financial activity, etc. is set up, the Controller will provide notification
to the appropriate parties of the responsibilities incumbent on them for good business
practices and sound financial management, including reference to the principles within
this policy.
Employees must have a means of communicating significant information to the City’s
administration.
The City must communicate effectively with external parties, such as auditors,
creditors, contractors, suppliers, regulators and other stakeholders.

Internal control is meant to keep the City focused on achieving its mission while avoiding
surprises. There is a balance between effective controls and mission accomplishment.
Costs associated with internal controls should not exceed their benefit, nor should controls
be allowed to stifle mission effectiveness and timely action. All levels of management
must assess the costs, benefits, and risks when designing controls to develop a positive
control environment and compensate for the risks of non-compliance, loss of assets, or
unreliable reporting while accomplishing the City mission.

The following specific internal control policies are adopted for use by City Departments:
Payroll Activities
• Salaries and wage rates are verified by the Human Resources Department.
• The responsibilities for hiring, terminating, and approving promotions are segregated from

-23-

•
•

The billing process is completed by an individual other than the one who collects cash
payments from customers.
Adjustments to customer accounts above our managerial threshold are approved by the
governing body only after review.

Cash Activities
• A reconcilement between the recorded cash balance and the bank balance is completed
monthly by an individual separate from the receipting and disbursing processes.
• A reconcilement between the receipts ledger and the credits to the bank account is
completed periodically by an individual separate of the receipting process.
• A reconcilement between the disbursement ledger and the debits to the bank account is
completed periodically by an individual separate of the disbursement process.
• Disbursements from and reimbursements to petty cash and/or change funds are

Principle 11: Management designs the political subdivision’s information system and related
control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks.
The Finance Department and Department Heads will work with the Information Technology
Department to ensure that information technology is used as an integral part of the internal control
system. This may include, but not be limited to:
• Setting permission such that only certain users may perform certain tasks
• Using technology to accomplish segregation of duties by forcing duties to be completed
by different users
• Automating certain processes and calculations
• Limiting the authority to access different components of various software to employees
with duties specifically related to that component
• Prohibiting user ID and password sharing among employees
• Restricting the authority to correct or make adjustments to records to key employees
• Requiring the use of prescribed forms or the approval of alternative forms
Principle 12: Management implements control activities through policies.
-24-

The City has an employee handbook that is regularly updated to communicate policies to
employees. Additionally, the Finance Department, with the assistance of the internal control team,
regularly works with departments and employees who handle financial transactions to recommend
and ensure best practices. All procedures are in writing and communicated frequently to all
relevant employees. Policies are available both electronically and in hard copy form.
4. Information and Communication
Principle 13: Management uses quality information to achieve the political subdivision’s
objectives.
The City strives to lead in the areas of financial transparency and accountability. By adopting
standards and investing in Systems that exceed State mandated minimums, City management
provides employees and stakeholders with high quality information and informatics systems. The
City Finance Department and Legal Department attend training and industry seminars to stay
abreast of changes and developments in requirements and communicate that information
effectively to impacted employees.
Principle 14: Management internally communicates the necessary quality information to achieve
the political subdivision’s objectives.
Internal communications on internal controls are communicated through adoption of formal
policies by relevant boards and commissions and/or the legislative body or documented through
memos from the Finance, Legal or relevant Department Head. Internal memos and reports are
maintained to document communication.
Principle 15: Management externally communicates the necessary quality information to achieve
the entity’s objectives.
Communications with the State Board of Accounts, other State agencies, grantor agencies, and
regulatory agencies are documented by email, memos, letters, and other forms of written

checked for accuracy, relevancy, and timeliness of information.
5. Monitoring Activities
Principle 16: Management establishes and operates monitoring activities to monitor the internal
control system and evaluate the results.
-25-

City Administration monitors and evaluates compliance with internal control policies via multiple
vectors. Separation of duties, redundancy polices, layered approval systems, monthly reports, and
physical controls such as video monitoring allow management to both review and evaluate control
systems.
The Finance Department, with the assistance of the internal control team, shall implement a
system of monitoring that includes:
• Periodic checks to determine if controls are in place and working effectively
• Reviewing control activities to determine if the actual activities are in compliance with
established procedures
• Documenting deficiencies in the internal control processes and remediating them quickly
•
Monitoring activities will be documented by signatures, initials, or other appropriate methods.
Principle 17: Management remediates identified internal control deficiencies on a timely basis.
Breaches of internal controls are subject to significant levels of internal scrutiny. If informed of a
material breach of internal control, the Finance Department and Mayor’s Office actively
investigate and address said breach and adjust policies and procedures to prevent such breaches in
the future. Once breaches are identified and investigated, a formal or informal corrective action
plan will be developed within 30 days. Failure to comply could result in disciplinary action up to
and including termination.

9. GRANT DRAWDOWNS
The grant drawdown policy is in response to State Board of Accounts Finding 2014-006, resulting
from an audit of the City of Gary’s Planning Department. For consistency with City of Gary
Department of Planning and Redevelopment practices, the Commission shall adopt the following
internal procedure for grant drawdowns.
1. Drawdown requests for any federal or state funded grant program and subsequent claims will
be reviewed independently by both the Deputy Director of Planning and the Deputy Director of
Redevelopment, or their respective designees, prior to submittal for payment to the Fiscal

fifteen (15) days of receipt, to ensure timely payments in advance of reimbursements.
3. For invoices concerning federal or state reimbursement grants, no reimbursement requests can
be made until vendor invoices are paid for the corresponding request. Any such request will be

-26-

reviewed independently by both the Deputy Director of Planning and the Deputy Director of
Redevelopment, or their respective designees, prior to submittal to Fiscal Secretary.
4. The Deputy Director Planning and the Deputy Director of Redevelopment, will each initial the
bottom right-hand corner of each claim prior to submittal to document their review of the invoice.

sole purpose of removing unpaid or delinquent property taxes or ameliorating outstanding
property tax issues with the offices of the Lake County Treasurer, Assessor, or Auditor or
Calumet Township Assessor.

replacement, planning, improvement, operation, regulation and maintenance of
the existing and future stormwater system.
This Ordinance’s stormwater service charge shall take effect no earlier than July
1, 2007.
Section 59.07
STORMWATER
PROCEDURES. (Ord. 10-2009)

SERVICE

RATE

ESTABLISHMENT

(A)
Basis for Charge. The stormwater service charge is designed to
recover the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the stormwater
system, and shall be the basis for assessment of the stormwater service charge.
This rate is established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide for
reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services, as well as
variations in the demand for services.
(B)
Charge for single-family residential properties.
The storm water service charge for all single-family residential properties
shall be $6.00 per month, based upon all single-family residential properties
having a single ERU. If a billing is for storm water service of less than one month,
billing shall be on a per-diem basis.

(C)
Charges for all properties other than single-family residential
properties.
The storm water service charge for all properties other than single-family
residential properties shall be a fixed customer charge of $4.50 per month per
parcel plus a variable rate of $1.50 per month charge for each ERU assessed on
said property.

Section 59.08

RATE STRUCTURE AND CALCULATION

(A)
Generally. For the purposes stated in Section 59.03, there is
hereby assessed a stormwater service charge for each property owner owning
land situated within the corporate limits of the City that contributes directly or
indirectly to the stormwater system of the City, in an amount as determined
below.
(B)
Impervious Area. For any such property, lot, parcel of land,
building or premises which contribute directly or indirectly to the stormwater
system of the City, such charge shall be based upon the quantity of impervious
area situated thereon. Impervious area of public rights-of-way and railroad lines
(which shall not be deemed to include adjacent property, such as a rail yard,
operated by a railroad), will not be included in the determination of a stormwater
service charge.
(B)
Classification of Property. All properties within the City will be
assigned an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, with all
properties having impervious area assigned at least one ERU, as follows:
(1) Single-Family Residential Properties:
A monthly flat-rate
charge for stormwater service rendered to single-family
residential properties shall be assessed to each single-family
residential parcel within the City limits.
All single-family
residential properties are hereby assigned one ERU.
(2) Other Properties: Properties with impervious area other than
those containing a single-family residence will be assigned an
ERU multiple based on the total amount of impervious area on
the property (measured in square feet) divided by 2,980 square
feet. ERU multiples shall be rounded to the nearest whole
integer.
(C)
Land Alterations. The issuance of any building permit or other
action which results in a land alteration of a property other than a single-family
residential property or a property that currently only contains a single-family
residence but will be no longer used for such purpose shall be cause to an

adjustment of the stormwater service charge determined under this section. The
property owner shall have the obligation of informing the Department of any such
changes.
(E)
Exceptions/Exemptions.
Except for public rights-of-way and
railroad lines, there shall be no exceptions or exemptions from the assignment of
gross stormwater ERU’s for any property with impervious area.
Section 59.09

BILLINGS; TERMS OF PAYMENT.

A.
Billings. All stormwater service bills shall be rendered on a monthly
basis unless additional or prorated billing is required to reflect customer changes,
initial billings or is otherwise required to adjust billing cycles. Charges for
miscellaneous services or work performed on behalf of a stormwater customer by
the Department shall be assessed at the time the work is completed and shall be
included in the customer’s next stormwater service bill. Stormwater billing for a
new property shall commence with the billing for water service, the meter set
date or date of occupancy whichever shall first occur. Additional stormwater
charges for an established service address necessitated by a change in the
amount of impervious area at the property shall commence on the date the new
certificate of occupancy or compliance is issued. Billing adjustments required to
correct impervious area measurements shall be applied retroactively to the date
of the customer’s initial protest. Adjustments shall be made by crediting the
stormwater service charge portion of the customer’s utility account until any
overpayment has been fully repaid.
B.
Rights and Responsibilities of Property Owner. Charges for
stormwater service shall remain the ultimate responsibility of the property owner,
including all penalties, recording fees, attorney’s fees, interest and court costs.
Fees assessed against real property constitute a lien against the property
assessed. For properties with inactive utility accounts where no water charges
have been generated for 60 days or more, a stormwater only account number will
be issued to such property, payable by the owner of said property, until water
charges have been reinstated. A lien attaches against real property occupied by
someone other than the owner only if the Department of Stormwater
Management notifies the owner within twenty (20) days after the time the user
fees became sixty (60) day delinquent. However, the Department of Stormwater
Management must give notice to the owner only if the owner has given the
Department of Stormwater Management written notice of the address to which to
send notice. Stormwater service charges attach to the property, provided,
however, that if a property owner sells or otherwise transfers such property billed
for stormwater service, such property owner shall be responsible for the payment
of all bills rendered for stormwater service until written notice of the transfer has
been provided to the City utility department, and the account may properly be
transferred to another customer.

C.
Terms of Payment. The stormwater service charges prescribed in
Section 59.07 shall be due on the payment date set out on the bill. It shall be a
violation of this Chapter to fail to pay a stormwater service bill when due. All bills
for stormwater services not paid on or before the due date shall be subject to a
collection or deferred payment charge of 10% on the outstanding balance.
Moving from one location to another in no way absolves the customer from
responsibility for any unpaid charges incurred at a previous location.
D.
Bad Check Charge: Checks returned for non-sufficient funds will
be subject to reimbursement of the fee the banking institution charges the City
utilities department and an administrative charge to be established by the
Department not in excess of the amount provided in I.C. 35-43-5-5(e). A
customer submitting a bad check may be prohibited from making future
stormwater service charge payments by check.
E.
Collection.
Delinquent stormwater service charges may be
collected in a civil action along with other delinquent City utility charges,
reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
Section 59.10

APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATION.

If, in the opinion of any property other than a single-family residential
property owner, the ERU multiple assigned to the property of such owner is
inaccurate in light of the amount of impervious area contained on said property,
such property owner shall have the right to contest such ERU determination.
The Department shall develop and promulgate policies and procedures to
resolve any such contests, including, as determined necessary, the conducting of
hearings and the making of determinations with respect to the measurement of
impervious area contained on any property.
Section 59.11

CREDIT POLICIES AND PROCEDURE

Currently the City requires all developments to meet certain minimum
detention criteria. Properties that meet such criteria will receive a 25% credit.
Properties that meet the minimum City requirements plus achieve additional
detention will receive up to an aggregate total of 40% credit for stormwater
detention. An additional 10% credit can be obtained for water quality measures
implemented by the property owner. The minimum stormwater service charge
shall remain one (1) ERU, even if the credit or credits reduce the ERU multiple
below one (1) ERU. The following outlines the criteria for each level of credit.
(A)

Minimum Detention Criteria. The City currently requires that all
new developments meet the following criteria:
(i)

Developed discharge not to exceed 10 year pre-developed
rate; and

(ii)

Development must provide retention or detention of 100
years developed rate on site through inline storage, pond or
parking lot.

Properties that meet these criteria shall receive a 25% credit. The City shall
develop policies and procedures for documenting compliance with the
requirements for this credit. If no records are available in the City, the owner
shall provide the information to obtain a credit.
All drainage facilities shall be in approved drainage easements before any credit
will be allowed. In addition, all drainage facilities shall be maintained by the
property owner and verified on annual inspections for the property owner to
maintain established credit. Inspections shall be performed annually. In the
event of non-compliance, the property owner shall be notified and given 30-60
days depending on the severity of the non-compliance to remediate the
deficiencies and respond. If such non-compliance has not been remediated by
the expiration date of the remediation period given to the property owner, the
credit shall be forfeited and the property owner must reapply to obtain a new
credit.
(B)

Maximum Detention Criteria. In addition to the minimum detention
credit, a property owner may receive up to an additional 15% credit
if the owner’s stormwater facilities exceed the City minimum
detention requirements in the manner hereinafter described. By
increasing capacity on-site, these detention efforts reduce the
demand and stress on the downstream drainage facilities. The City
shall credit up to an additional 15% for facilities that meet the
following criteria:
Criteria
(i) Provide an additional 20% volume storage
(ii) Provide a reduction in developed peak
runoff rate by 20%
(iii)
Provide extended storage with the potential

The City shall develop policies and procedures for documenting compliance with
the requirements for the credits described in this Section 59.11. If no records are
available in the City, the owner shall provide the information to obtain a credit.
(C)

Volume Credit. Properties that provide additional volume under the
emergency spillway of the detention facility shall receive up to an
additional 4% credit. To receive this credit, the applicant must
provide the calculations and data necessary to quantify the
additional storage volume. The credit is calculated by determining
the minimum detention volume required by the City and comparing

it to the volume provided. The additional credit shall be calculated
based on the following table:
Table 51.11 (Credit) – Volume Credit

Peak Reduction Credit. Properties that provide additional
decrease in peak flow rate shall receive up to an additional 4%
credit. The credit is calculated by determining the required peak
outflow to meet the City requirements, and comparing it to the
designed peak outflow. The additional credit shall be calculated
based on the following table:

Extended Storage Credit. Properties that provide extended storage
greater than 24 hours will receive up to 3% additional credit. The
credit will be calculated by determining the time it takes the pond to
drain, from its peak elevation, to the original time to peak of the
undeveloped conditions. The additional credit percentage will be
determined by the following table:

(F)

Water Quality Credit. Properties that provide measures that
improve the quality of stormwater that leaves the property will
receive up to an additional 10% above the maximum 40% for
stormwater quantity. This credit can apply to property owners who
are required to maintain individual NPDES industrial permits. All
applicants for the water quality credit will be required to provide

copies of past Site Compliance Evaluations and most current Site
Compliance Evaluations to maintain this credit. The City shall
develop policies and procedures to establish standards for the
granting of the water quality credit.
(G)

Payment Required. Application for any one or more credits, or any
appeal of the determination or determinations made in respect
thereto shall not constitute a valid reason for non-payment by the
user of the originally assessed stormwater service charge.

(H)

Appeals. Determinations regarding credits for a user may be
appealed in the same manner as will be established by the City for
appeals of ERU determinations pursuant to Section 59.10 of this
ordinance.

(I)

Inspections. Any party requesting a credit shall permit the City and
its agents, to undertake any inspection or inspections needed, in
the discretion of the City, to determine whether any one or more
credits are appropriate. The City further reserves the right to
inspect periodically all storm drainage control facilities of a user that
has received one or more credits to ascertain whether such
facilities are operating properly. If such facilities, due to improper
maintenance or any other reason, fails to meet the criteria required
for any credit, the City shall issue an order to complete the repairs
of such facilities within 60 days. If such repairs are not completed
within the 60-day period, the City, in its sole discretion, may issue
an order eliminating or reducing detention credits to an appropriate
level. Any such facility shall not be eligible to reapply for credit
adjustments for a period of 12 months following any credit reduction
or elimination ordered by the City.

(J)

Land Alteration. The issuance of any building permit or other action
which results in land alteration with respect to a property receiving
any one or more credits under this section shall be cause for an
adjustment, as appropriate, of the credits to which the owner may
be entitled. The property owner shall have the obligation of
informing the City of any such changes in the manner prescribed.

Section 59.12

for such private drain and which easement is duly recorded in the
office of the Wayne County Recorder.

(3)

All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
the private drain or private drainage system shall be borne by the
owner. The owner shall indemnify the City for any loss or damage
directly or indirectly occasioned by the construction or installation of
the private drain, including backwater damages from the public
drainage system.

(4)

The connection or outlet of a private drain into the public drainage
system shall conform to City specifications and standards for
sanitary sewers and storm drainage works. Any deviation of the
prescribed procedure or material must be approved by the
Department before installation.

(5)

No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connection with

thereof without first contacting the office of the City Engineer.

(6)

All excavations for construction or installation of private drainage
facilities shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so
as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall
be restored in accordance with the specifications and standards for
sanitary sewers and storm drainage works of the City.

(7)

All private construction and installation of stormwater drainage
works shall include proper restoration and provisions for erosion
and sediment control in accordance with the specifications and
standards for sanitary sewers and storm drainage works of the City
and all other drainage requirements.

(8)

No property owner shall change the stormwater runoff pattern of
the property of such owner in such a way that neighboring
properties or City property is adversely affected. Consideration and
provisions must be made for drainage to and from neighboring
properties in connection with land alterations.

(9)

No owner, manager, developer or occupant of any real property
shall tap, drain or outlet, either directly or indirectly, into any public
sewer until a sewer tap permit has been obtained from the City and
until the owner has satisfied the obligation to pay all assessments,
reimbursements and pro- rata share of sewer extension costs laid

against that property for public sewers which serve it. A sewer tap
permit given in error shall not operate to nullify any such obligation
that has been duly recorded nor estop the City from charging and
collecting such costs at any subsequent time.
(10)

Sewer tap permits shall be obtained from the Sanitary District office
and shall be issued to contractors, who shall pay to the District a
fee for each sewer tap permit. Not later than 24 hours before
making each sewer tap and building of the sewer installation the
tap contractor or property owner shall notify the District of such
connection so that an inspection may be made by the District prior
to backfilling the said sewer installation.

(11)

In cases of requests for connections to newly constructed mains,
prior to acceptance by the Board of Stormwater Management a
prime contractor’s release must be executed and granted through
the District. Upon satisfaction of all other requirements, a permit for

opportunity for education, employment, access to public conveniences and
accommodations and acquisition through purchase or rental of real property including but

impediment to equal opportunity. Equal education and employment opportunities and

of real property are hereby declared to be human rights.

promotion of equal opportunity without regard to race, religion, color, sex, handicap,
national origin or ancestry through reasonable methods is the purpose of this Ordinance.
(3)
It is also the public policy of this City to protect employers, labor organizations,
employment agencies, property owners, real estate brokers, builders and lending
institutions from unfounded charges of discrimination.
(4)
It is hereby declared to be contrary to the public policy of the City of Richmond
and an unlawful practice for any person, for profit, to induce or attempt to induce any
person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective
