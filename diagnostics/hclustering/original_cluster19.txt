Report Damage From Severe Thunderstorms
INDIANAPOLIS – Indianapolis and Marion County residents, who sustained damage caused by severe weather, including
wind and flooding beginning Sunday night, February 27 and ongoing, are urged to report damage online at
https://oas.in.gov:4443/hs/damage. A link to the form is available on the Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS)
website at www.in.gov/dhs. In the middle of the page under “Topics of the Day,” click on “Report damage from severe
storms and flooding that began February 27, 2011.”
Individuals with uninsured damage from the severe weather must report quickly and the faster we can assess the situation, the
better, especially if the determination is to pursue federal assistance.
Individuals will be asked to provide their name, address, phone number, damage to property and type of damage the property
sustained. Losses can include structural damage to homes and loss of personal property.

This Is Not An Application For Any Assistance Program
This is NOT an application for a grant with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Information will be used
to help the Department of Public Safety Division of Homeland Security (DPS/DHS) preliminarily assess damage to
determine if federal assistance can be pursued by the state.
Individuals without Internet access are encouraged to contact a friend, family member or neighbor for assistance. Web
access is also available at many libraries, religious institutions, community centers and other public facilities. As a last resort,
individuals may contact DHS directly to report damage at 317-327-3900.
Additional rainfall combined with melting snow could aggravate or expand current flooding situations. We are asking that
Indianapolis and Marion County residents continue to pay attention to the forecast and purchase flood insurance before
flooding.

CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS NEW PRODUCTS REVIEW PROCESS
The City of Indianapolis has revised the review process for “New Products” to be added to
current Indianapolis Transportation Standards and Indianapolis Stormwater Standards. All
products that may become the responsibility of the City of Indianapolis Department of Public
Works to maintain or regulate after a project is constructed must go through the New Products
Committee Review prior to installation. Specific concerns, requests for re-analysis, review of
new/additional information or general comments must also go through the New Products
Committee for review. The review process is as follows:
1. SUBMIT APPLICATION
a. Fill out the “INDIANAPOLIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS NEW
PRODUCTS REVIEW APPLICATION” found at this link:
www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPW/Business/Specs/Pages/UpdatedStormWaterManual.aspx

The application fee if the product has a stormwater quality component is estimated to be
approximately $2,200. The application fee to review specific concerns, request for reanalysis, and review of new/additional information or general comments is $1,000. Do not
send a check with the application. After an application is received, a “Letter of
Agreement” will be created by the review consultant and submitted to the applicant. A
signed agreement and a check must be submitted prior to processing the application for
“Preliminary Review.”
c. A presentation is often required as a part of the preliminary review. The review consultant
shall coordinate this presentation with the New Products Committee. (Note: Preliminary
review of product to determine if full review is needed shall be performed on an hourly basis.
All funds remaining after preliminary review shall be returned to the applicant if a full
review is not pursued.)

results of the review and what, if any, limitations there may be for the product. There will be a
two week comment period available for the Product Representative to bring up any issues
they have with the results to the review consultant. If any issues require additional review, the
review consultant must identify if there are sufficient funds available to address these issues.
If funds are not available, a new proposal will be created. If there are no issues submitted
within the two week comment period, the review consultant is to refund any funds remaining
from the application fee. Any issues submitted after the comment period has closed will

Background
• When it rains, water runs off impervious surfaces into
our storm water drainage system
• Rooftops
• Parking lots
• City streets
• Driveways
• Compacted gravel
• Once it reaches our storm water system, the water is
released directly into our waterways.

The Storm Water Asset

Background
Storm Water Fee Structure
•

Historic - Storm water fees for
residential and non-residential
property owners are calculated
differently.
– Residential properties: Flat fee for
all—regardless of how much
impervious surface area.
– Non-residential properties: Charged
based on how much impervious
surface area exists on property.

•

July 1, 2015 - Storm water fees for
residential and non-residential
property owners will be calculated
the same.
– Residential properties will be
assessed to determine the amount of
impervious surface area and charged
based on that assessment—just as
non-residential users are today.

Storm Water Credits
• The Department of Public Works has
developed a system of credits for residential
and non-residential property owners who
have storm water control facilities in place to
manage and reduce the impact on the
drainage system.

Purpose and Application
of Credits
• Provide storm water fee discount for
specifically benefitting storm water
program/system and drainage ordinance
• Applicable to Residential and
Non-Residential Properties/Parcels

Tornado preparedness
A TORNADO is a violent windstorm characterized by a twisting, funnel-shaped cloud. It is spawned by a
thunderstorm and produced when cool air overrides a layer of warm air, forcing warm air to rise rapidly.


A tornado WATCH means a tornado is possible in your area.
o When issued: if there is time, move cars inside a garage, and lawn furniture and yard
equipment inside, to keep from being damaged or becoming dangerous projectiles; listen
to local radio and TV stations for further updates; be alert to changing weather conditions
and danger signs (see below); if you have any indication that a tornado may be
approaching, take cover immediately; DO NOT WAIT FOR A WARNING TO BE
ISSUED.



A tornado WARNING means a tornado has been sighted and may be headed for your area.
o When issued: go to safety immediately.
 If you are inside, go to the safe place you picked to protect yourself from glass
and other flying objects.
 If you are outside, go to the basement of a nearby sturdy building or lie flat in a
ditch or low-lying area.
 If you are in a car or mobile home, get out immediately and head for safety (as
above).

Danger signs
 Dark, often greenish sky.
 Large hail.
 A large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating).
 Loud roar, similar to a freight train.
Preparing for a tornado
 Build a kit; Make a plan; Be informed; Get involved.
 Make sure your insurance will cover any potential damage.
 Keep insurance policies, documents, and other valuables in a safe-deposit box.
Surviving a tornado
 Grab your emergency supply kit if there is time.
 The safest place is underground or as low to the ground as possible and away from all windows. A
basement is best, or an interior hallway, bathroom, or closet on the lowest floor.
 In a high-rise building, pick a place in the interior of the building away from windows.
 If you live in a mobile home, choose a safe place in a nearby sturdy building. Your mobile home
park may have a designated shelter.
 If you are outside or in a car, go immediately to the basement of a nearby sturdy building. If you
cannot find shelter indoors, lie flat in the nearest ditch or low-lying area and use your arms and
hands to protect your neck and head.
 Watch out for fallen power lines and stay out of the damaged area.

1

Recovering from a tornado
 Contact your insurance agent to discuss claims.
 Contact the American Red Cross for emotional support and immediate assistance.
 Listen to your radio for information on assistance that may be provided by the state or federal
government and other organizations.
 If you hire cleanup or repair contractors, check references and make sure they are qualified.
