Saturday, December 15, five area children will shop with Street Department

According to Streets and Parks Superintendent George Belmore, Webster created
and has led this initiative since 1989.
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of Wayne and our entire team‚Äôs devotion to this
     cause. Saturday‚Äôs shopping trip will be a fun and meaningful
     adventure, making Christmas a little brighter for some deserving
     youngsters in town and even brighter still for Wayne and our crew,‚Äù
     Belmore said.
In related holiday events, everyone is invited and encouraged to visit the
holiday light display in TPA Park every evening. Visitors to the Park can meet
Santa every evening from 6:00 ‚Äì 9:00 p.m. now through Sunday, December 23.
While the light display is free of charge to see, various City officials and

available to take nominal donations from those visiting the light display to
help continue funding future Christmas displays.
For questions or interview requests, contact Belmore at 659-2912.

benefits of recycling.

**** Joint statement from Mayor Chris McBarnes, Fire Chief John Kirby and
Police Chief Troy Bacon ****
With six to ten inches of rain from Tropical Storm Isaac forecasted to reach
the Clinton County area by the Labor Day holiday weekend, the Frankfort Police
and Fire Departments stand ready to assist the Clinton County Emergency
Management Agency as well as area residents, should severe weather happen.
     ‚ÄúWhile it is difficult to predict the actual weather we may
     experience this weekend, our team is prepared to handle what comes
     our way. I want to assure our residents and holiday weekend visitors
     that our City public safety professionals are on alert.
     &#8220;As we have been, we will continue to monitor the forecast and
     provide weather and safety updates as we become aware of them. Check
     the colored announcements bar on the home page of the City‚Äôs Web
     site: www.frankfort-in.gov for updates. A yellow/orange bar indicates
     warning information and a red bar indicates emergency information,‚Äù
     Mayor McBarnes said.
     ‚ÄúWe reached out today to EMA Director Darrell Sanders and offered
     the Fire Department‚Äôs support with whatever public safety services
     might be needed. Our firefighters have filled sandbags in the past
     and we are prepared to do that again, along with any other safety
     services that may be needed,‚Äù Fire Chief Kirby stated.
     ‚ÄúWhile there is no cause for alarm, as the weekend approaches, we
     are keeping a close eye on incoming weather. Our police officers‚Äô
     primary mission is the continued safety and security of everyone in
     our community. We ask you to be mindful of changing road conditions,
     to exercise extra caution when driving and avoid traveling through
     high water areas, should severe weather happen,‚Äù Police Chief Bacon
     said.
     ‚ÄúPublic safety is our number one priority ‚Äì always. So while we
     are hoping Clinton County avoids severe weather, taking a proactive
     approach and preparing for worse case scenarios is our responsibility
     to help protect the lives and property of those we serve. As always,
     call 911 should you have an emergency,‚Äù McBarnes said.

MINUTES
SPECIAL MEETING
UTILITY SERVICE BOARD
SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
The Special Meeting of the Utility Service Board of the City of Jasper, Indiana, was held in the
Council Chambers of City Hall in Jasper at 7:35 AM on Friday, September 30, 2016.
The meeting was called to order by Chairman Rick Stradtner.
UPON CALL OF THE ROLL, THE FOLLOWING WERE PRESENT:
Rick Stradtner ‚Äì Chairman
Adam Auffart ‚Äì Secretary
Wayne Schuetter ‚Äì Electric Commissioner
Roger Seng ‚Äì Water Commissioner
Alex Emmons ‚Äì Wastewater Commissioner
Michael Kern ‚Äì Gas Commissioner
ALSO PRESENT:
Tim Doersam ‚Äì Gas & Water Manager
Ed Hollinden ‚Äì Wastewater Manager
Bud Hauersperger- General Manager
Ashley Kiefer ‚Äì Office Manager
ABSENT:
Keith Masterson ‚Äì Vice Chairman
Jerry Schitter ‚Äì Electric Distribution Manager
Renee Kabrick ‚Äì City Attorney

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE (DVD-04:53)
Chairman Rick Stradtner led the Pledge of Allegiance.
PURPA PLAN (DVD-05:20)
Chairman Stradtner stated the reason for the Special Meeting was to take action on the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) Implementation Plan with Indiana Municipal Power
Agency (IMPA).
General Manager of Utilities, Bud Hauersperger, said that a letter was received from IMPA in
late July or early August asking the Jasper Municipal Electric Utility to adopt IMPA‚Äôs PURPA
Implementation Plan. The letter and plan have been under legal review for the past couple of
months by the City Attorney and with outside counsel. After much discussion with the Electric
Utility Service Board

1

9/30/16

Committee, the City‚Äôs attorneys, and IMPA‚Äôs legal counsel, a couple of changes have been made
to the letter.
The clause, ‚ÄúHowever, it is specifically noted that Jasper may opt out of the Plan at any time it
deems necessary, with appropriate notice to FERC. Accordingly, Jasper Municipal Electric
Utility has adopted the Plan as one of its policies and agrees to abide by the Plan‚Äôs provisions
until such time as it would determine to opt out of the Plan.‚Äù was added to the end of the letter.
Hauersperger said the addition of this clause is better than being able to opt out in 5 years, as was
discussed as a possibility to present to IMPA, at the September 19th Utility Service Board
Meeting. It is as simple as sending a letter to FERC if the Jasper Municipal Electric Utility
wants to opt out of the IMPA PURPA Implementation Plan.
Chairman Stradtner reminded everyone that by signing this letter we are giving IMPA the right
to serve as our agent to purchase all energy, including that from a QF (Qualifying Facility),
should one be built in our area. It now also gives us an opt out capability by notifying FERC.
Wayne Schuetter made a motion to sign the letter from IMPA to adopt the IMPA PURPA
Implementation Plan. Alex Emmons seconded the motion.
Michael Kern asked if IMPA could come back and file a lawsuit if the Jasper Municipal Electric
Utility opted out of the IMPA PURPA Implementation Plan, since our full-requirements contract
with IMPA states that all power must be purchased from IMPA. Hauersperger stated that the
full-requirements contract would still have to be dealt with, but the opt-out clause gives the
Jasper Municipal Electric Utility more flexibility.
Motion approved, 6-0.
Councilwoman Nancy Eckerle asked what ‚Äúappropriate notice to FERC‚Äù meant in the letter.
Hauersperger responded that it meant that the Jasper Municipal Electric Utility would need to
send a letter to FERC saying we wanted to opt out of the IMPA PURPA Implementation Plan.
Wayne Schuetter said the specifics about how to opt out would be covered under the FERC
regulations.

There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting was adjourned at 7:47AM
upon motion by Alex Emmons and second by Michael Kern. Motion approved, 6-0.

The minutes were hereby approved_______ with ___X___without corrections this 17th day of
October, 2016.
