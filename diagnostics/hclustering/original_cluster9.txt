ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Economic Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
December 8, 2009. Chair Jeff Cardwell called the meeting to order at 5:31 p.m. with the
following members present: Barbara Malone, Michael McQuillen, Mary Moriarty Adams
and Ryan Vaughn. Absent were Jose Evans and Doris Minton-McNeill.
PROPOSAL NO. 408, 2009 - approves the guaranty of the yield on low income tax
credits in order to enable the sale of such low income tax credits by the Indianapolis
Housing Agency for rehabilitation projects in the City to be developed by its non-profit
arm Partners for Affordable Housing, Inc.
Bruce Baird, Director of Strategic Development, Indianapolis Housing Agency (IHA),
stated that this proposal was postponed at a previous hearing, and IHA was asked to
come back to answer additional questions that were raised by the committee. He said
that IHA has continued to work with City Real Estate Advisors, which is the equity
syndicator that presented at the last meeting. Mr. Baird stated that due to some of the
concerns raised by committee members and the City Controller, they have been able to
restructure the financing package for IHA‚Äôs Phase I of the Welcome Home
development. He said that they have been able to find different investors that will not
require the guaranty that was drafted. Mr. Baird stated that IHA has come before the
committee to ask that they table the proposal. He said that IHA will work with Councillor
Kent Smith, who sponsored the proposal, to withdraw it. Mr. Baird stated that the
development will go forward as planned and they will close the financing in January,
2010. He said that the construction and renovation of 500 units will continue.
Chair Cardwell thanked IHA for all that they do to provide affordable housing for the
City. He said that it is comforting to know that the project will not be delayed.
Councillor McQuillen asked what the savings for the City as a potential liability will be
with the restructure of the guaranty. Mr. Baird stated that it is estimated between $5 to
$6 million, if the guaranty would have ever been called. He said at this time, that would
not be requested of the city.
Councillor Malone asked if they had not been asking the city for the guaranty of the
yield, they would not have needed to come before the committee for the approval of the
rehabilitation project. Mr. Baird answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Vaughn stated that the committee is encouraged to see that the project will
go through. He said that their only reservation was to make sure that the financing
structure was appropriate, and it sounds like IHA has the best deal to move forward.

Councillor McQuillen moved, seconded by Councillor Malone, to ‚ÄúTable‚Äù Proposal No.
408, 2009. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 433, 2009 - approves the statement of benefits of Comlux Completion
USA, LLC, an applicant for tax abatement, for property located in an economic
revitalization area
Stephanie Quick, Assistant Administrator, Department of Metropolitan Development
(DMD), stated that last year, state law was passed which requires Council approval in
addition to approval from the Metropolitan Development Commission (MDC), for tax
abatements that are located in an allocation area. She said that Comlux Completion
USA, LLC falls into that category. Comlux is located at 2640 South Cargo Drive in
Wayne Township, which is located in Council District 22, Councillor Bob Cockrum‚Äôs
district.
Ms. Quick stated that Comlux is based in Zurich, Switzerland and was formed in 2003
as a business jet operator. She said that in 2008, Comlux purchased the Indianapolis
Jet Center as part of an overall aggressive restructuring of Comlux to obtain growth
related to the business jet market. Ms. Quick stated that the Indianapolis Jet Center
performs interior design and finishing for business jets, and Comlux views this as a
significant growth opportunity. She said that the company‚Äôs vision is to become one of
the leading providers of VIP cabin completion services, delivering convenience and
comfort to their customers. Comulx continues to operate business jets and deals with
sales and acquisition of jets. Ms. Quick stated that Comlux is seeking tax abatement to
assist with the purchase and installation of new machinery and information technology
equipment related to the expansion. She said that the City is recommending a five-year
personal property tax abatement for the company‚Äôs investment of $1 million in
manufacturing and information technology related equipment, the retention of 75 jobs at
an average wage of $31 per hour, and the creation of an additional 400 jobs over the
next three years at an average wage of $27 per hour. Ms. Quick stated that the types of
jobs the company has indicated that they will employ includes; program managers,
cabinet makers, upholstery workers, sheet metal workers and engineers. Ms. Quick
stated that the value of the five-year tax abatement is estimated at just over $46,000,
over the life of the abatement.
Councillor McQuillen asked if Councillor Bob Cockrum is in support of this proposal. Ms.
Quick answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to send Proposal
No. 433, 2009 to the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass‚Äù recommendation. The motion carried
by a vote of 5-0.

discussed.
i. A number of IMBAC members serve on the advisory committee for the update
to the MPO‚Äôs Regional Bikeways Plan. Jeremy Moore with the Indy MPO stated
that a partial draft will be sent out to advisory committee members in a week
for review and comment. He stated that the new plan will be more illustrative
than the previous one in an effort to make it more user‚Äêfriendly. The plan

draft are due by the end of December.

New charges filed against home invasion suspect Adrian Anthony
Anthony now charged in Nov. 19 robbery and attempted robbery of two women
(Indianapolis, Ind.) ‚Äì Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced today new charges
against Adrian Anthony, a previously charged defendant in the October home invasions and
assaults on Spring Mill Road and E. 79th Street as well as the November murder of Robbie
Gibson. Anthony is charged with Attempt Robbery (Class A Felony), Robbery (Class B
Felony), and Criminal Confinement (Class C Felony) for an incident that occurred on
November 19, 2013, on the city‚Äôs Northside. Anthony is accused of approaching two women
and their children in the parking lot of an apartment complex armed with a handgun.
According to the probable cause affidavit filed in the case, Anthony allegedly told one of the
victims, ‚ÄúGive me all you got or I‚Äôm going to shoot you and your baby.‚Äù He allegedly then
struck her multiple times in the head with his gun, causing her to lose consciousness and
fall while holding the child.
The victims reported that the suspect fired a single shot into the air during the incident. A
spent 9mm shell casing was recovered from the scene and later determined to have been
fired from the same firearm as that of a 9mm casing recovered from the November 27,
2013, scene of the shooting death of Robbie Gibson on North Gray Street.
Anthony was arrested on December 1, 2013, and remains in custody. Sierra White,
believed to be the girlfriend of Anthony at the time of the incidents, was charged in
December with Assisting a Criminal for allegedly assisting Anthony in evading arrest after a
warrant for his arrest was issued.
An initial hearing on the new case is scheduled for Thursday, February 27, at 9:00 a.m. in
Court 4.
A charge of a crime is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until
and unless proven guilty.

The Parks and Recreation Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, April

PROPOSAL NO. 211, 2004 - appoints Emily Nichols to the Board of Parks and
Recreation
Ms. Nichols summarized that she is very enthusiastic about the possibility of serving on
the Parks Board. She said that she is very involved in the community, and working with
youth is something she values in particular.
Councillor Cockrum recapitulated that several weeks ago an appointment was
suggested for the Parks Board, but this never materialized due to a conflict. He asked
what was the status of that proposal. General Counsel Haith stated that the proposal
had been tabled and would eventually ‚Äúdie‚Äù, and a vote on Proposal No. 211 should be
taken.
Chair Gray said that he knows Ms. Nichols well and supports her appointment 100%.
Joe Wynns, Director, Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), commented that he
got acquainted with Ms. Nichols when United Water LLC funded the TPL study for land
acquisition. He stated that she is a hard worker, and he also supports her appointment.
Councillor Salisbury moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, to send Proposal No. 211,
2004 to the full Council with a ‚ÄúDo Pass‚Äù recommendation. This motion carried by a
vote of 7-0.
OTHER BUSINESS
Mr. Wynns stated that he had a couple of announcements. The first one is that today
DPR held a press conference concerning a new Earth Discovery Center at Eagle Creek
Park. He said there are some tax dollars going to this Center, but most of the funding is
from grant dollars. This Center will allow visitors to experience nature ‚Äúhands on‚Äù.
Cameras and microphones will be distributed throughout the park so that visitors can
witness animals in their natural habitat, can participate in watching the birth of animals,
and can also experience birdwatching at a greater level.
Mr. Wynns noted that the Summer Fun Guides are out. It offers many activities for the
summer, and he encouraged everyone to get involved.

Schools Superintendent, to acquire a huge parcel of land in the Ravenswood area.
Mr. Wynns said that DPR is in the process of working on the 4-year Comprehensive
Plan. He said it must be submitted to the State in particular for grant approval. Once
adopted he will distribute this to the Council.
Councillor Mahern asked where people can obtain copies of the Fun Guides. Mr.
Wynns responded that copies are in the Indianapolis Star as well as made available in
community centers, libraries, Boys and Girls Clubs, etc. There is also a copy available
on the City‚Äôs website.
Reverend P.M. Pinkney stated that she would like to see the Fun Guides available in
churches and other faith-based organizations as well. Chair Gray concurred with
Reverend Pinkney and thanked her for her suggestion.
