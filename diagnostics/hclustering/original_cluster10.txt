In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink,
USEPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management prescribe regulations that limit the
amount of certain contaminants in water provided by
public water systems. This publication describes
those guidelines for the City of Bloomington’s drinking water. Food and Drug Administration regulations
establish limits for contaminants in bottled water,
which must provide the same protection for public
health.
Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of
some contaminants. The presence of contaminants
does not necessarily indicate that water poses a
health risk. More information about contaminants and
their potential health effects can be obtained by calling the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Hotline
(800-426-4791).
Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population.
Immuno-compromised persons, such as persons with
cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have
undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS
or other immune system disorders, some elderly and
infants can be particularly at risk from infections.
These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water
Hotline (800-426-4791).

We don’t often pause to consider the incredible value of a
safe, reliable water supply — and the water system that
delivers it — in our everyday lives. But consider what tap
water does that no other water can do.

Only Tap Water Delivers …
… public health protection.
In a world where an estimated 3 million people die every
year from preventable waterborne diseases, our water systems allow us to drink from virtually any public tap with a
high assurance of safety. Each community water supply
must meet rigorous federal and state health-protective
standards.
… fire protection.
A well-maintained water system is critical in protecting our
communities from the ever-present threat of fire. A system
that provides reliable water at an adequate pressure can be
the difference between a small fire and an urban inferno.
The ability to suppress fires also influences new home construction, business location decisions and insurance rates.
… support for the economy.
Businesses or housing developments do not succeed without a safe and sustainable water supply. Tap water is critical
to businesses’ day-to-day operations and is often a primary
ingredient in the products they create.

surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances
resulting from the presence of animals or human activity.

The source of the City of Bloomington’s drinking water is surface water from Monroe Reservoir, located nine miles southeast of Bloomington. The City
of Bloomington has received a copy of the Indiana-Monroe Reservoir Source Water Assessment. Federal guidelines require the State of Indiana to issue
Source Water Assessments in order to identify significant or possible sources of contamination. Information concerning Monroe Reservoir’s Source Water Assessment is available by contacting the City of Bloomington’s Water Quality Office.

North Vernon Water Department
2016 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORT
THE ANNUAL WATER QUALITY REPORT FOR JANUARY 1, 2015 TO DECEMBER 31, 2015
Este informe contiene información muy importante sobre el agua que usted bebe. Traduzcalo, o hable con alguien que lo entienda
bien.
This report is intended to provide you with important information about the quality of the drinking water and the efforts
made by North Vernon Municipal Utilities to provide safe drinking water. If you have any questions or need more information
about the contents of this report, please contact: Michael Hess @ 812-346-2037. Alternatively, you can join us at our Utility
Board Meetings, which are regularly held every 1st and 3rd Mondays at The Carnegie Government Center on 143 East Walnut
Street, North Vernon at 6:00 P.M. We encourage you to participate and to give us your feedback.
The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs, springs, ponds and
wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally- occurring minerals, and in some
cases, radioactive materials, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or human activity. The source of
drinking water used by North Vernon Water Department is surface water taken from the Muscatatuck River & supplemented by
Brush Creek Reservoir.
Contaminants that may be present in untreated source of water may include:
Microbial Contaminants: such as viruses and bacteria, may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural or livestock
operations, and wildlife.
Inorganic Contaminants: are salts and metals, which can be naturally- occurring or result from urban storm water runoff,
industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, and mining or farming operations.
Pesticides and Herbicides: have a variety of sources, such as, agriculture, storm water runoff, or residential use.
Organic Chemical Contaminants: including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial
processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban storm water runoff, and residential uses.
Radioactive Contaminants: which can be naturally- occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities
Some of the terms and abbreviations used in this report are:
AL:--Action Level, the concentration of a contaminant which, when exceeded, triggers treatment or other
requirements which a water system must follow.
Avg. -- Regulatory compliance with some MCLs are based on running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples.
LRAA:- Locational Running Annual Average, the average result for one of a number of sampling locations.
MCL:--Maximum Contaminant Level, the highest level of contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to the MCLGs
as feasible using the best available treatment technology.
MCLG:--Maximum Contaminant Level Goal, the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to
health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety.
MRDL:--Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level Goal, the highest level of disinfectant allowed in drinking water.
ppm: ---parts per million, a measure for concentration equivalent to milligrams per liter- or one ounce in 7,350 gallons of water.
ppb: ---parts per billion, a measure for concentration equivalent to micrograms per liter-or one ounce in 7,350,000 gallons of water.
pCi/L: ---picocuries per liter, a measure for radiation.
Turbidity is a measurement of the cloudiness of the water caused by suspended particles. We monitor it because it is a good indicator
of water quality and the effectiveness of our filtration system and disinfectants.

Special note on lead: If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young
children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. Our system is
responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your
water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes
before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may have your water tested. Information on
lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at
http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.

Total Organic Carbon
The percentage of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) removal was measured each month and the system met all TOC removal
requirements set, unless a TOC violation is noted in the violations section.

Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised
persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other
immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice
about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC has set guidelines with appropriate means to lessen the risk of
infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants which are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at
(800) 426-4791.Our water system is working with the community to increase awareness of better waste disposal practices to
further protect the sources of our drinking water. We are also working with other agencies and with local watershed groups to
educate the community on ways to keep our water safe. Please share this information with people who are new to the community
or are non-billed customers so they may know the quality of water they drink.
In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the EPA prescribes regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants that
may be present in the water provided by public drinking water systems. FDA regulations establish limits for contaminants that
may be present in bottled water, which must provide the same level of protection for public health. Drinking water, including
bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants that may cause taste, color, or
odor problems. The presence of this contaminant does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk or that it is not
suitable for drinking. More information about contaminants and their potential health risk can be obtained by calling the EPA’s
Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791.

Huntingburg Municipal Water 2014 Consumer Confidence Report
Is my water safe? Yes
Huntingburg Water Utility last year, as in years past, met all U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state drinking water health standards. Your local water utility
vigilantly safeguards its water supplies and once again we are proud to report that our system has not violated a maximum contaminant level or any other water quality
standard.

Do I need to take special precautions? No………..unless you have very special needs
Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons
who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek
advice about drinking water from their health care providers. The EPA/Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and
other microbial contaminants (none of which has ever been detected in our water system) are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).

Where does my water come from?

Huntingburg Municipal Water Utility is supplied by surface water from Huntingburg City Lake and Patoka Lake, both of which take great care to protect the lake water from any contamination sources.

Why are there small traces of contaminants in my tap water and purchased bottled water?

Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water
poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-4264791). The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through
the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. Microbial
contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife. Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and
metals, can be naturally-occurring or result from urban storm water runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming. Pesticides and herbicides, which
may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban storm water runoff, and residential uses. Organic Chemical Contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which
are by-products of industrial processes and naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities. In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes
regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants is bottled water
which must provide the same protection for public health.

Educational Statement for Lead

Infants and young children are typically more vulnerable to lead in drinking water than the general population. It is possible that lead levels at your home may be higher than at other homes in the
community as a result of material used in your home’s plumbing. If you are concerned about elevated lead levels in your home’s water, you may wish to have your water tested and flush your tap for
30 seconds to 2 minutes before using tap water. Additional information is available from Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791). Special Note On Lead: If present,elevated levels of lead can
cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children, primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. Huntingburg Water
Utility is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can
minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, You may want to
have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water testing methods and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at

http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.
Good News! The Middle Patoka Source Water Protection Grant is actively at work in our area. This 319 grant is a collaboration between both Federal / State officials (EPA,
IDEM), the Alliance of Indiana Rural Water and local Steering Committee participants from our community. The primary focus of the grant is to apply grant-awarded funds on
activities and improvements that affect the water quality of the Middle Patoka River region and its tributaries. If you want more information or would like to get involved in this
wonderful program that is truly making a difference in our community, please go towww.patokawatershed.org

Important Information about Lead in Water:

If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious
health problems, especially for pregnant women
and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated
with lead service lines and home plumbing. We
cannot control the variety of materials used in
plumbing components.
When your water has been sitting for several
hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2
minutes before using water for drinking and
cooking.
If you are concerned about lead in your water, you
may wish to have your water tested. Information
on lead in drinking water, test methods, and steps
you can take to minimize exposure is available
from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at

Your Drinking Water Source
The source of the City of Bloomington’s drinking water is surface water from Monroe Reservoir, located nine miles southeast of Bloomington. The City
of Bloomington has received a copy of the Indiana-Monroe Reservoir Source Water Assessment. Federal guidelines require the State of Indiana to issue
Source Water Assessments in order to identify significant or possible sources of contamination. Information concerning Monroe Reservoir’s Source Water Assessment is available by contacting the City of Bloomington’s Water Quality Office. CBU participates in EPA’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring
Rule. Contact the Water Quality Office for more information or copies of results related to this testing program.
The sources of drinking water (both tap and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the
surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances
resulting from the presence of animals or human activity.

Contaminants that may be present in source water include:
•

Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, that may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems,
agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.

•

Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, that can be naturally occurring or result from urban stormwater
runoff, industrial or domestic waste water discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.

•

Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff,
and residential uses.

•

Organic chemical contaminants, include synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, that are byproducts of industrial
processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and septic
systems.

•

Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production
and mining activities.

Water Wise Tip:
A faucet leaking 30 drips a
minute amounts to 56 gallons
of wasted water every month.
Reduce your water
consumption by fixing leaking
faucets!

Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons, such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly and infants can be particularly
at risk from infections. These people should seek
advice about drinking water from their health care
providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate
means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are
available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline
(800-426-4791).

If present, elevated levels of lead can
cause serious health problems, especially
for pregnant women and young children.
Lead in drinking water is primarily from
materials and components associated
with lead service lines and home plumbing. We cannot control the variety of
materials used in plumbing components.
When your water has been sitting for
several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your
tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before
using water for drinking and cooking.
If you are concerned about lead in your
water, you may wish to have your water
tested. Information on lead in drinking
water, test methods, and steps you can
take to minimize exposure is available
from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or
at www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.

Contaminants that may be present in source water include:

The sources of drinking water (both tap and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the
surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances
resulting from the presence of animals or human activity.

The source of the City of Bloomington’s drinking water is surface water from Monroe Reservoir, located nine miles southeast of Bloomington. The City
of Bloomington has received a copy of the Indiana-Monroe Reservoir Source Water Assessment. Federal guidelines require the State of Indiana to issue
Source Water Assessments in order to identify significant or possible sources of contamination. Information concerning Monroe Reservoir’s Source Water Assessment is available by contacting the City of Bloomington’s Water Quality Office.

Annual Water Quality Report
The Madison Water Department is proud to present its Annual Water
Quality Report for 2015. The purpose of this report is to raise your
understanding of drinking water and increase the public’s awareness of the need to
protect drinking water resources. This report includes a description of Madison’s
water system, our treatment methods, and the results of water quality testing that
was performed from January 1 through December 31, 2015.
The Madison Water Department is proud of its record of providing high
quality water to its customers. In order to ensure that our water is safe to
drink, we conduct regular sampling for different contaminants. The United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department
of Environmental Management (IDEM) have established limits for these
contaminants. During the 2015 calendar year, as in previous years, there were no
violations of any of these standards in the Madison water system.

Drinking Water Source, Treatment Methods and Distribution System
The Madison Water Department obtains all of its water from seven wells. Nearly
900 million gallons of water was pumped from these wells in 2015. In accordance
with Indiana State law, the Madison Water Department has prepared a Wellhead
Protection Program to ensure the safety of these wells. The Phase III wellhead
Protection plan was approved by IDEM in 2013. A source water assessment
was performed by IDEM in 2006, and their work indicated that Madison’s

Not all sample results may have been used for calculating the Highest Level Detected because some results may be part of an evaluation to determine where compliance sampling should occur in the future

to prevent tooth decay. The treated water is distributed through approximately 120
miles of water main pipes for delivery to over 5,700 customers. This distribution
system also includes six storage tanks that have a total capacity of 3.9 million
gallons. Because the Madison Water Department sells water to a number of rural
water systems that surround the City, we estimate that our wells provide water to
a total population of over 20,000 people.

Potential Sources of Drinking Water Contamination
While groundwater wells such as Madison’s are a generally safer and
more reliable source of drinking water than surface water sources such
as rivers and lakes, all types of source water can be exposed to different
contaminants. As water travels over the surface of the land or through
the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases,
radioactive material. It may also pick up substances resulting from the presence
of animals or from human activity.

Important information about your drinking
water monitoring requirements NOT met for
City of Bloomington Utilities.
Our water system recently violated a drinking water
standard. Although this is not an emergency, as our
customers, you have a right to know what happened,
what you should do, and what we are doing to correct this situation. We are required to monitor your
drinking water for specific contaminants on a regular
basis. The results of regular monitoring are an indicator of whether or not our drinking water meets
EPA’s health standards. The September 2014 monitoring testing for Total Organic Carbon was either
not performed or failed to comply with the requirements of Stage 2 Disinfectant Byproducts Rule (St1
DBPR); therefore we cannot be sure of the quality of
the water at that time.
What should I do? You do not need to use an alternative (e.g. bottled) water supply. However, if you
have specific health concerns, consult your doctor.
What does this mean? This is not an immediate
risk. If it had been, you would have been notified immediately. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) has no
health effects. However, Total Organic Carbon provides a medium for the formation of disinfectant byproducts. These byproducts include trihalomethanes
(THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) Drinknig water
containing these byproducts in excess of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) may lead to adverse
health effects, liver or kidney problems, or nervous
system effects, and may lead to an increased risk of
getting cancer.
What happened? What is being done? The system failed to provide a monthly sample for September 2014. CBU developed new procedures and resolved the problem by October 2014. For more information contact the Office of Water Quality.

Your Drinking Water Source
The source of the City of Bloomington’s drinking water is surface water from Monroe Reservoir, located nine miles southeast of Bloomington. The City
of Bloomington has received a copy of the Indiana-Monroe Reservoir Source Water Assessment. Federal guidelines require the State of Indiana to issue
Source Water Assessments in order to identify significant or possible sources of contamination. Information concerning Monroe Reservoir’s Source Water Assessment is available by contacting the City of Bloomington’s Water Quality Office. CBU participates in EPA’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring
Rule. Contact the Water Quality Office for more information or copies of results related to this testing program.
The sources of drinking water (both tap and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the
surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances
resulting from the presence of animals or human activity.

Contaminants that may be present in source water include:
•

Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, that may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems,
agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.

•

Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, that can be naturally occurring or result from urban stormwater
runoff, industrial or domestic waste water discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.

•

Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff,
and residential uses.

•

Organic chemical contaminants, include synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, that are byproducts of industrial
processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and septic
systems.

•

Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production
and mining activities.

Water Wise Tip:
A faucet leaking 30 drips a
minute amounts to 56 gallons
of wasted water every month.
Reduce your water
consumption by fixing leaking
faucets!

Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods,
and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available
from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at
http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.
When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can
minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap
for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using water for drinking
or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you
may wish to have your water tested.
If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health
problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and
components associated with service lines and home plumbing.
Carmel Utilities is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in
plumbing components.

JIM BRAINARD, MAYOR

More information about contaminants
and potential health effects can be
obtained by calling the EPA’s Safe
Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791,
or via the web at www.EPA.gov.

Lead in Home Plumbing
Carmel Utilities regularly tests drinking water for lead and
takes steps in its treatment process to ensure corrosive elements do not result in elevated levels of lead in customer tap
water. Lead exposure comes primarily from water service lines
which extend from the water main to the home and/or from
interior plumbing components. Homes built before 1950 are
more likely to have lead pipes. Homes built before 1986 may
have lead soldering. Carmel Utilities lead testing comes
exclusively from homes most likely to have lead in its plumbing
system. If you would like to determine if your home has lead
in its plumbing components or service line, hire a licensed
plumber who can best advise you.

Our 3-Step Water Treatment Process

Carmel’s Water Supply Source
Carmel’s water supply comes from a ground water source
called an aquifer. The aquifer is commonly referred to as
the Upper White River Basin Watershed. Eighteen wells
located throughout the city pump water from the aquifer

1) Iron Removal The water treatment plant aerates the
water to oxidize the soluble iron found naturally in well
water. The oxidized iron adheres to itself forming clumps
that are filtered out of the water by iron filters.
2) Water Softened Then, the iron filtered water passes
through a process where the water is softened to 8 grains
hardness, which is considered moderately hard water.
Should you desire water that has been softened to zero (0)
grains hardness, a home softener will be needed. During
periods of extremely high summer water usage, the level of
softening may be decreased to meet customer demand.
3) Chlorine and Fluoride Added Chlorine is added to
destroy any harmful bacteria present and to maintain
a level of protection as the water travels through the
distribution system. Fluoride is added to help strengthen
resistance to cavities in teeth. Following the injection of
chlorine and fluoride, the water enters the distribution
system to be delivered to Carmel’s homes and businesses.

People with Compromised Immune Systems
Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants
in drinking water than the general population. Immunocompromised persons such as persons with cancer
undergoing
chemotherapy,
persons
who
have
undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other
immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be
particularly at risk from infections. These people should
seek advice about drinking water from their health care
providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to
lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other
microbiological contaminants are available from the Safe
Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).

to five water plants for treatment. The production wells
range in depth from 49 to 108 feet deep, are 10 to 36
inches in diameter, and have pumping capacities
ranging from 175 to 2,800 gallons per minute.

Water Division Map

Source of Carmel Clay’s water supply that
comes from Citizens Water
White River supplies two of the four surface water
treatment plants: White River and White River North.
Morse Reservoir, near Noblesville, stores water to assure
a dependable supply in the White River to these plants.
Fall Creek is another surface water supply. Geist
Reservoir stores water to assure and adequate supply
in Fall Creek for the Fall Creek Treatment Plant.
A number of wells are used intermittently to supplement
the supplies to the White River, White River North, and
Fall Creek plants. Citizens Water also receives some
surface water from Eagle Creek Reservoir which supplies
water to the T.W. Moses plant.
Currently Citizens Water has five groundwater stations
that serve smaller portions of its service area. These are
White River North, Geist Station, Harding Station, South
Well Field, and Ford Road Plant. These groundwater
stations treat water pumped from underground water
sources called aquifers.

2015 WATER QUALITY RESULTS
Carmel Utilities routinely monitors for
constituents in your drinking water according
to Federal and State laws. This table shows
the results of our monitoring for the period
of January 1st to December 31st, 2015.

Water Purity

As water travels over the land or
underground, it can pick up substances
or contaminants such as microbes,
inorganic and organic chemicals, and
radioactive substances. All drinking

water, including bottled drinking water, may be
reasonably expected to contain at least small
amounts of some constituents. It’s important to
remember that the presence of these constituents
does not necessarily pose a health risk.

All sources of drinking water are
subject to potential contamination
by substances that are naturally
occurring or man made. These
substances can be microbes,
inorganic or organic chemicals
and radioactive substances.
All drinking water, including bottled
water, may reasonably be expected
to contain at least small amounts of
some contaminants. The presence of
contaminants does not necessarily
indicate that the water poses a
health risk.
More information about contaminants and potential health effects
can be obtained by calling the
Environmental Protection Agency’s
Safe Drinking Water Hotline
at (800-426-4791).

Water Contaminants
before Treatment
The sources of drinking water
(both tap water and bottled water)
include rivers, lakes, streams,
ponds, reservoirs, springs, and
wells. As water travels over the
surface of land or through the
ground, it dissolves naturally
occurring minerals and, in some
cases, radioactive material, and
can pick up substances resulting
from the presence of animals or
from human activity. Contaminants
that may be present in source
water include:
• Microbial contaminants, such
as viruses and bacteria, which
may come from sewage treatment
plants, septic systems, agricultural
livestock operations, and wildlife.
• Inorganic contaminants, such
as salts and metals, which can be
naturally-occurring or result from
urban storm runoff, industrial or
domestic wastewater discharges,
oil and gas production, mining or
farming.
• Pesticides and herbicides,
which may come from a variety of
sources such as agriculture, storm
water runoff, and residential uses.
• Organic chemicals, including synthetic and volatile organic
chemicals, which are by-products
of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also
come from gas stations, urban
storm water runoff, and septic
systems.
• Radioactive materials, which
can be naturally occurring or be
the result of oil and gas production
and mining activities.
In order to ensure tap water is
safe to drink, EPA prescribes
regulations that limit the amount
of certain contaminants in water
provided by public water systems.
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) regulations establish limits
for contaminants in bottled water,
which must provide the same
protection for public health.

Testing for Cryptosporidium
Cryptosporidium is a microscopic organism
that lives in the intestines of animals and
people. When ingested this microscopic
pathogen may cause a disease called
cryptosporidiosis, which has flu-like
symptoms. Although there has been no
cryptosporidium found in treated, finished
drinking water, cryptosporidium is found in
source water such as White River, Fall Creek
and Eagle Creek Reservoir. The U.S.
EPA has created the Long Term 2 Enhanced
Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2) for
the sole purpose of reducing illness linked
with the contaminant Cryptosporidium and
other disease-causing microorganisms in
drinking water. The rule will bolster existing
regulations and provide a higher level of
protection of your drinking water supply.
