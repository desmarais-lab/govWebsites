INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

TO: THE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES, ALLEN COUNTY, INDIANA

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and each
major fund of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), departments of the City of Fort Wayne (City), as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively
comprise the Utilities' basic financial statements as listed in the Table of Contents.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Utilities' internal control.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
(Continued)

Opinions
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the business-type activities and each major fund of the Utilities, as of
December 31, 2014, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows
thereof and for the year then ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of the Utilities are intended to present the financial
position, the changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows of only that portion of the
business-type activities of the City that is attributable to the transactions of the Utilities. They do not purport
to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the City, as of December 31, 2014, the changes in its
financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this
matter.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the
Management's Discussion and Analysis, as listed in the Table of Contents, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context.
We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with
management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained
during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on
the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an
opinion or provide any assurance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
As management of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), we offer readers of
the Utilities’ financial statements, this narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the Utilities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.
We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction
with additional information that we have furnished in the basic financial
statements and the notes to the basic financial statements.
Financial Highlights


The Utilities acquired water assets serving approximately 12,500
customers and settled litigation regarding the condemnation of water and
sewer assets serving 9,600 customers. The purchase price of $67 million,
less $16.9 million paid in 2008, was financed through revenue bonds
issued in December 2014.



The assets and deferred outflow of resources of the Utilities exceeded its
liabilities (net position) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 by $528.0
million and $508.5 million, respectively.



The Utilities’ net position increased for the years ended December 31,
2014 and 2013 by $18.6 million before prior period adjustment of $0.9
million and $26.9 million, respectively.



The Utilities’ added new bonded debt and long-term loans payable for
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $72.7 million and $101.3
million, respectively. The 2014 increase in debt consists of one new
Water Revenue Bond, three new Wastewater SRF loans and additional
withdrawals against existing SRF loans.
The Utilities were able to take advantage of the recent low interest rate
financial markets and acquire new long term debt in 2013 at rates ranging
from 1.95% to 3.50%. Additionally, refunding bonds issued in early 2013
at rate averaging of 1.00% were issued to retire bonds with interest rates
ranging from 1.30% to 4.55%.



The Utilities’ net investment in capital assets for the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013 increased approximately $10.6 million and
$7.0 million. Significantly, the Utilities continue to meet all 2009-2014
capital investment milestones required by the 2008 Federal Consent
Decree.

Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the Utilities’ basic financial
statements. The Utilities are governmental entities classified as enterprise funds,
subsets of proprietary funds. When an entity charges a fee to cover the entire
cost of its operation, these services are classified as a proprietary fund. And
more specifically, when an entity is self-supported completely by providing
services to outside customers, it is an enterprise fund. An enterprise fund’s
financial statements are comprised of three statements and the accompanying
notes to these statements. The three statements are: 1) statement of net
position, 2) statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position and 3)
statement of cash flows. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the Utilities’ financial
statements. The notes can be found on pages 13-34 of this report.
The Utilities provide water, wastewater, stormwater, and yard waste services.
The Utilities’ financial statements have been prepared to reflect the activity of
each of these services. The Electric Utility’s generation and distribution systems
(operating system) were leased to a private firm in 1975 and the entire operating
system was purchased by that private firm in 2011. Since 1975 portions of the
lease payments were accumulated in a Community Trust Fund and that Trust
Fund coupled with the assets generated from the sale of the Electric Utility’s
operating assets were transferred to the City Community Legacy Fund in 2012.

Financial Analysis
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
governmental unit’s financial health. In the case of the Utilities, assets and
deferred outflow of resources exceeded liabilities by $528.0 million and $508.5
million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The largest portion
(83.8%) of the Utilities’ net position in 2014 reflects its net investment in capital
assets (land, buildings, machinery, equipment and distribution and collection
infrastructure), less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still
outstanding.
Another significant portion of the Utilities’ net position ($54.5 million, or 10.3%)
represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be
used.
The Utilities net position increased $18.6 million and $26.9 million for the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
5

Capital Assets and Capital Improvement Program
The Utilities total capital assets in service are $1.213 billion with an accumulated
depreciation of $360.2 million for a net book value of $853.0 million. The
statement of net position also includes $78.3 million in construction in progress
reflecting capital projects in various stages of completion. During 2014,
approximately $122.5 million was invested in capital projects (see Note 5).
Debt
At December 31, 2014, the Utilities had approximately $468.9 million in bonds
and loans payable, an increase of $48.7 million over last year.
The Utilities closed on four new long-term bond/loan issues in 2014. The bonds’
proceeds were used to fund significant capital expenditures. The new bond/loan
issues in 2014 were:
-

An open market water revenue bond for $63.0 million payable over 20
years at range of rates of 2.00% to 4.00%.
A traditional SRF wastewater loan for up to $17.0 million over 20 years
at 2.35%.
A traditional SRF wastewater loan for up to $60.9 million over 20 years
at 3.074%.
A taxable traditional SRF wastewater loan for up $5.0 million over 20
years at 3.074%

The Utilities paid principal of $24.0 million and $25.3 million in 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budget and Rates


On December 28, 2007, the Utilities agreed to a Long-Term Control Plan
(LTCP), in the form of a federal Consent Decree, which will ultimately bring
the Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system into compliance with
the federal Clean Water Act. The Consent Decree became effective April 1,
2008. The Utilities committed to combined sewer overflow reductions that
require an investment of approximately $240.0 million (denominated in 2005
dollars) in infrastructure solutions over the next 18 years. The Utilities also
agreed to:
o Eliminate three sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated cost of $31.0
million.
o Maintain the entire storm and sewer systems to performance
standards prescribed in the LTCP.
o Mitigate assessed penalties with local investments in septic tank
elimination subsidies and rain garden stipends.
6

The Consent Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to
achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines or
maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with terms and
conditions of the Consent Decree.
Consistent with the long term nature of the Consent Decree, Fort Wayne City
Council (Council) approved another five year rate plan that generally
increased wastewater unit rates by approximately 9% effective January 1,
2015 and again on Jan 1, 2016-2019 of each year by 8.5%, 8%, 8% and 8%,
respectively. Council had previously approved a 5 1/2 year rate plan that
spanned the period July 2009 through December 2014.
Council also authorized the issuance of another wave of bond financing; up to
$257 million in debt to fund the 2016-2019 capital plan that will accomplish a
significant portion of the infrastructure investment required to fulfill the
requirements of the Consent Decree. As of December 31, 2014, the Utilities
have issued $65.9 million debt associated with the $257 million that Council
authorized. In 2009, Council approved the issuance of up to $265 million.
Through December 31, 2014, the Utilities had exhausted the full amount
authorized by Council in 2009.
The Utilities are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Consent Decree. Significantly, the Utilities completed: the upgrade to the
wastewater plant primaries and completed 21 combined sewer separation
projects. The Utilities also constructed a CSO pond bleedback process that
fully treats over 1 billion gallons of wastewater each year that previously
entered the Maumee River only partially treated. Untreated wastewater
storage capacity was increased by nearly 100 million gallons through several
pond enhancement projects and the pump station used to fill those ponds has
had its capacity increased to maximize the available storage.
The wastewater treatment plant upgrade is substantially complete and can
treat up to 85 million gallons per day (mgd), which is our target capacity and
is up from 60 mgd.
Lining wastewater pipelines significantly extends the life of the pipeline,
improves overall system flow and reduces reactive maintenance. Since 2008,
the Utilities have invested $35 million to line approximately 153 miles of pipe.
The annual pipe enhancement rate since 2008 is 1.4% which exceeds our
annual goal of 1% per year.
The City of Fort Wayne has three rivers and each has its own control limits.
The St Joe river expects to achieve its control limits in 2015, a full year earlier
than planned.
The single largest project associated with satisfying the requirements of the
Consent Decree is a large underground tunnel that swings north along the St
7

Mary’s river, past the convergence of the three rivers and then follows along
the Maumee to the Wastewater Plant. Preliminary design is substantially
complete. The tunnel will be approximately 5 miles long, drilled through rock
over 100 feet below ground and between 12 and 14 feet in diameter. The
total project cost is estimated at $180 million and the estimated completion
date is planned for 2022.


On December 4, 2014, the Utilities acquired from Aqua Indiana all of the
water assets and a portion of the sewer assets that are located in Allen
County Indiana. The terms of the acquisition included the settlement of
litigation regarding the 2002 condemnation of a portion of the acquired
assets. Aqua’s assets were adjacent to the Utilities and over half of the
customers have been integrated with the Utilities pre-acquisition systems.
The total purchase price was $67 million, of which $16.9 million was paid in
2008. The net purchase price of $50.1 million was funded by proceeds from
a $63 million bond issued in December 2014. Bond proceeds in excess of
the net purchase price were used for financing and integration costs. The
acquired utility assets include 312 miles of water pipe, 20 miles of wastewater
pipe, 6 treatment plants, 5 water towers and 1,500 hydrants; servicing 1,600
sewer customers and 22,000 water customers consuming approximately 1.5
billion gallons of water per year.



The Water Utility successfully acquired SRF funding in 2011 for a ultra-violet
disinfection system (UV system) valued at nearly $20 million. The UV system
was selected as the optimal incremental disinfection methodology to comply
with an EPA mandate; the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment
Rule. This UV solution was completed and on-line December 2013, ahead of
the enforcement deadline of April 2014.



In 2012, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) and Fort Wayne
City Council approved a three year water rate plan increasing water revenues
by 33.9%. The water rate increase will be implemented in three annual
increments (Phases) starting in January 2013. The increased revenues will
provide funding for many repair and replacement projects but, significantly, up
to 9 miles of water main replacement each year. As our infrastructure has
aged, funding for our water main replacement program has not kept pace with
the increase in our water main breaks. The new revenues will allow us to
approach our goal to replace 1%, or ten miles, of our water main pipelines per
year.

On December 18, 2013, the IURC, based on a Cost of Service Study submitted
by the City, revised Phase II and Phase III water rates that were approved in
2012 and that were to be effective January 1, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The
revision did not affect the total anticipated revenues for each year but did modify
the sources of those revenues; most significantly for public fire protection. Prior
to 2014, the City paid City Utilities for public fire protection through a per hydrant

8

fee. Effective 2014, all water customers now pay for public fire protection with
fees based on the size of their water meters.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014

(1) Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Entity
The City of Fort Wayne Utilities (the Utilities) are collectively, a division of the City of Fort
Wayne, Indiana. The financial statements reflect only the activity of the Utilities and are not
intended to present fairly the position of the City of Fort Wayne and the results of its
operations and cash flows of its enterprise funds. The Utilities consist of Water, Wastewater,
Stormwater, and Electric Utilities in addition to the Yard Waste Facility. All five areas are
considered proprietary in nature. The Electric Utility generation and distribution systems were
sold to a private firm in 2010.
Basis of Accounting and Financial Reporting
The Utilities prepare their financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as
applied to governmental units.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses and other changes in net assets during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Utilities consider all highly liquid investments
(including restricted assets) with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
Investments
Investments are stated at fair value, except for short-term (less than one year), highly liquid
investments (i.e. Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, etc.), which are reported at
cost or amortized cost.
Restricted Assets/Net Position
All restricted assets/net position, as presented in the accompanying financial statements, are
restricted due to enabling legislation.

13

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014
Capital Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes interest incurred during
construction periods. Donated property, plant and equipment are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of donation. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not
add to the value of the asset or materially extend the assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
When an individual asset is retired, depreciation is calculated. The difference between the
original cost and the calculated depreciation results in a recognized loss.
Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Yard Waste Utilities’ assets are depreciated by
individual asset. Electric Utility assets are depreciated using the group method.
Estimated useful lives, in years, are as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Equipment and other
Distribution and collection

Water

Net interest cost incurred on borrowed funds for the Water, Wastewater and Stormwater
Utilities is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction. In 2014, net interest
capitalized was $659,892 for the Water Utility, $3,802,897 for the Wastewater Utility and
$85,326 for the Stormwater Utility.
Unbilled Utility Revenue
The Water Utility accrues revenue for estimated water distributed but not yet billed as of the
balance sheet date. Likewise, the Wastewater Utility and Stormwater Utility accrue revenue
for estimated wastewater and stormwater service not yet billed as of such date.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies are stated at cost (average cost for the Water Utility; first-in, first-out
for the Wastewater Utility). Amounts for Stormwater, Electric and Yard Waste are immaterial
and not reported.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014
Bond

Issuance

Costs,

Discounts

and Premiums

Bond issuance costs, discounts and premiums are amortized over the lives of the respective
bond issues using the interest method. The unamortized balance of premiums/discounts is
included in noncurrent bonds payable on the statement of net position. The unamortized
balance of bond issuance costs is reported as regulatory assets on the statement of net
position per the exception for regulated utilities.
Compensated Absences
Employees earn vacation at rates from ten days to twenty-five days per year, based on the
number of years of service. One year of unused vacation leave may be carried over to the
next. Unpaid vacation pay is recorded as a liability as the benefits accrue to the employee.
Accrued compensated absences for Utilities’ personnel are charged as an operating
expense, using the vesting method, based on earned but unused vacation and sick leave
days including the Utilities’ share of social security and medicare taxes.
All full-time employees will receive 40 hours of sick time per calendar year to be used or
forfeited by the end of the same calendar year. Regular part-time employees will receive 20
hours of sick time per calendar year. Sick time will be pro-rated for all employees hired after
April 30th of each calendar year.
Employees with a balance of sick time as of December 31, 2013, will have this balance
placed into a separate, frozen sick time account. All employees with a frozen sick time
account will receive compensation for this unused sick leave upon separation from
employement at $1.00 for each hour up to 520 hours.
Employees with a frozen sick time account will be eligible to either 50 percent of the
employee’s hourly rate as of December 31, 2013 for each accumulated hour over 520, or an
employee with 20 years of service and who retires, may receive credit at 100 percent of the
employee’s hourly rate at December 31, 2013 for each sick hour over 520 to be used for the
purchase of group health insurance. The maximum payment per employee cannot exceed
$25,000.
Classification of Revenue
The Utilities have classified their revenue as either operating or nonoperating according to the
following criteria:
-

Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange
transactions, such as customer charges.

-

Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange
15

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014
transactions, such as contributions and
other revenue sources that are defined as
nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and
Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Government Entities That Use Proprietary Fund
Accounting, and GASB Statement 34, such as investment income.
Deferred Outflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred outflow of resources. This separate financial statement section element,
deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to future
periods and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until
then. The Wastewater utility only has one item that qualifies for reporting in this category. It
is the deferred charge on refunding reported in the statement of net position. A deferred
charge on refunding results from the difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its
reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the
refunded or refunding debt.
(2) Deposits and Investments
Deposits
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government’s deposits
may not be returned to it. Indiana Code 5-13-8-1 allows a political subdivision of the State of
Indiana to deposit public funds in a financial institution only if the financial institution is a
depository eligible to receive state funds; and has a principal office or branch that qualifies to
receive public funds of the political subdivision. The bank balances were insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which covers
all public funds held in approved depositories. The Utilities do not have a formal policy for
custodial credit risk.
Investments
Authorization for investment activity is stated in Indiana Code IC 5-13. The Utilities had the
following investments at December 31, 2014.

Investment Policies
Indiana Code 5-13-9 authorizes the Utilities to invest in securities backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Treasury or fully guaranteed by the United States and issued by
16

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014
the United States Treasury, a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. Indiana Code also authorizes the Utilities to invest in
securities fully guaranteed and issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality or a
federal government sponsored enterprise. These investments are required by statute to have
a stated final maturity of not more than two years. Indiana Code also provides for investment
in money market mutual funds that are in the form of securities of or interest in an open-end,
no-load, management-type investment company or investment trust registered under the
provision of the Federal Investment Company act of 1940, as amended. Investments in
money market mutual funds may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the funds held by the
Utilities and available for investment. The portfolio of an investment company or investment
trust used must be limited to direct obligations of the United States, obligations issued by a
federal agency, a federal instrumentality, a federal government sponsored enterprise; or
repurchase agreements fully collateralized by direct obligations of the United States or
obligations issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal government
sponsored enterprise. The form of securities of or interest in an investment company or
investment trust must be rated as AAA, or its equivalent by Standard and Poor’s Corporation
or its successor or Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or its successor.
The form of securities in an investment company or investment trust should have a stated
final maturity of one (1) day.

Monthly deposits into sinking fund account for the Wastewater Utility’s net revenues is
required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual interest payment
and 1/12 of the next annual principal payment. Other related debt service requirements are
held in the debt service account.
17

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014

Monthly deposits into sinking fund accounts of both the Water and Stormwater Utilities’ net
revenues are required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual
interest payments and 1/12 of the next annual principal payments. Upon meeting certain
minimum balance requirements, transfers may be made to unrestricted cash accounts.
Surety bonds purchased by the Utilities cover the Waterworks and Stormwater Reserve
Accounts requirements.
Debt Service Reserve
In addition to the sinking fund accounts, revenue bonds require debt service “reserve
accounts” which require funding at: the lesser of 10% of bond proceeds, the maximum annual
principal and interest required thereon, or 125% of the average annual principal and interest
requirements thereon. The Utilities calculate its debt service reserve accounts on a
consolidated basis and may fund the debt service reserve by holding cash or through the
purchase of surety bond insurance. Among other requirements, the surety bond insurer must
maintain a AAA or Aaa rating with Standards and Poor’s or Moody’s respectively.
Prior to 2009, all Utility revenue bonds’ debt service reserves were funded through surety
bond insurance except the Sewage Works Junior Revenue Bonds of 1998 A and 1998 B
which were cash funded. As a result of the financial crisis that occurred in late 2008 – early
2009 and up to and including 2013, the surety bond insurers failed to maintain their AAA/Aaa
rating. While still insured, this failure to maintain AAA/Aaa ratings required the Utilities to
cash fund the debt service reserve accounts for the affected revenue bonds. As of December
31, 2014, all surety bond insurance for Waterworks and Sewage Works Revenue Bonds have
been replaced with cash funded debt service reserves as required by bond ordinance.
The surety bond insurer for the Stormwater Management District Revenue Bonds of 2006
has failed to maintain the required AAA/Aaa rating. The appropriate disclosures have been
made to the bondholders and no other action has been taken.
Construction
Unspent bond issue proceeds to be used in the construction of designated capital assets are
included in this account.
Airport Expressway
In 2010, the Water Utility entered into a tri-lateral agreement with the Redevelopment
Commission and a Developer to construct a water main extension along the airport
expressway. The Redevelopment Commission agreed to advance TIF funds to the Water
Utility at such times so as to pay the Developer according to the contractual payment
schedule. Monies received by the Water Utility prior to the Developer’s payment due date will
be held in a restricted account.

Customer Deposits
Customer deposits are refundable amounts received from Water Utility customers to insure
against nonpayment of billings or water main damages.
Connection Fees
Certain area connection fees are designated for repayment of certain development costs as
well as for reinvestment in specific areas. The unspent connection fees are reported in this
restricted category.
Septic Elimination Program
In 2009, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works authorized the creation of a City Utilities
Revolving Fund as an alternative funding source for septic tank elimination in Allen County.
This fund provides the funding necessary to construct wastewater mains allowing
homeowners to discontinue use of failing septic tanks and connect to public infrastructure.
The program also provides financial incentives to encourage septic tank elimination. Any
unexpended funds are restricted for future septic tank elimination projects.
(4) Assessments Receivable
Assessments receivable represent assessments due from customers for wastewater
connections. The individual assessments range from $2,000 to $24,000 and are due in 60,
120 or 180 monthly principal installments plus interest on the unpaid portion at ranges from
0% to 7% per year.

(6) Asset Purchase and Settlement of Litigation
On December 4, 2014, the City (Utilities) acquired all of the water assets and a portion of the
wastewater assets in Allen County, Indiana of Utility Center, Inc., doing business as Aqua,
Indiana, Inc. (Aqua). The December 4th Asset Acquisition Agreement (AAA) also settled the
outstanding litigation regarding the 2002 condemnation of a portion of Aqua’s water and
wastewater utility assets, provides for the treatment, by Aqua, of 1.5 million gallons per day of
wastewater from the City spanning a 10 year period with an option for 5 additional years at
volumes to be determined by the City and other post acquisition issues such as: 1) job
opportunities for any displaced Aqua employees, 2) meter reading services to enable Aqua to
bill its sewer customers, 3) wastewater territory modifications and protection, 4) wastewater
rate management and 5) other matters.
The total purchase price was $67 million, of which $16.9 million was paid in 2008. The entire
purchase price was funded through bonds; the 2008 portion temporarily through a series of
bond anticipation notes and permanently financed by the Water Revenue Bonds of 2012.
The remaining balance of $50.1 million was financed by the Water Revenue Bonds of 2014.
The acquired utility assets included 312 miles of water pipe, 20 miles of wastewater pipe, 6
treatment plants and 5 water towers and 1,500 hydrants; servicing 1,600 sewer customers
and 22,000 water customers annually consuming approximately 1.5 billion gallons of water.
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 69 require the assets acquired be
recorded at their acquisition price which is assumed to be the market-based entry price. An
outside appraisal firm was utilized to assist with the valuation of individual assets. Individual
assets were valued at fair market value and recorded at purchase price or fair market value,
22

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES

whichever was less. The allocation of the $67 million purchase price resulted in $21,725,585
being allocated to the water assets acquired in 2008, $1,868,168 to the wastewater assets
acquired in 2008 and $43,406,247 to the water assets acquired in 2014. Non-current
wastewater assets were reduced from a net fair market value of $3,228,513 to the purchase
price of $1,868,168. Net water assets’ fair market value exceeded the purchase price by
$302,334, resulting in a reduction of non-current water assets acquired in 2014 of $81,069
and the recognition of a deferred outflow of revenues for water assets acquired in 2008 of
$383,403. The Utilities elected to amortize fully the deferred outflow of revenues in 2014.
The Utilities have retired or will retire all but one of the newly acquired water treatment plants
including supply wells and connecting appurtenances by the end of 2015. A reserve for
obsolescence of $7,975,505 was recorded in 2014 in anticipation of these retirements.
The Utilities assumed liabilities of $581,835 for incentive contracts with developers that
reimburse back to the developers a portion of the cost of their donated capital. The typical
contract spans 10 years and the reimbursement occurs as residences connect to the water
distribution system. No other liabilities were assumed as part of this Purchase Agreement.
(7) Developer Notes Payable
Certain future revenues in newly developed areas are pledged as payment to retire developer
debt associated with infrastructure installed to enable the new developments. Capital
surcharges applicable only to designated new development regions and area connection fees
generated from the designated new development regions will be applied to the developer
debt until paid in full. Only revenue generated and collected from the new developments is
available to retire the debt. Pledged revenues were $362,852 for Wastewater Utility in 2014.
Developer notes payable were $1,930,047 for Wastewater Utility in 2014. The debt accrues
interest at prime, which as of the end of 2014 was at 3.25%, plus 1%. Developer notes
payable are included in current liabilities.

Loans Payable:
Indiana State Revolving Fund Loan Program (SRF) is a program that provides wastewater
and drinking water loans, often at reduced interest rates and reduced issuance costs, to
Indiana cities and towns. SRF “draw-down” loans are awarded as a “not-to-exceed” loan
amount and the amount is later fixed at the amount actually borrowed to complete the preestablished wastewater or drinking water projects. The interest rate is fixed at the time of the
award and the duration is established shortly thereafter. For shared pool loans, SRF
coordinates the financing activities for several Indiana communities and issues bonds on the
open market to provide the funding for each community’s projects. The loan amount, interest
rate and duration are fixed at the time of the consolidated loan’s issuance. Occasionally,
SRF will make traditional loans with fixed rate, amount and duration.
With the exception of the SRF Revenue Bonds of 2008, SRF loans payable are issued on a
parity basis with revenue bonds and are collateralized identically by the net revenues of the
issuing Utility.
Details of all Water Utility State Revolving Fund (SRF) loans payable at December 31, 2014
are as follows:

(11) Equity Transfers
The 10-year sewer capacity improvement program includes storm sewer construction funded
through the Wastewater Utility or Stormwater Utility. New storm sewers allow old combined
sewers to be converted to sanitary-only lines. As projects are completed, the new storm
sewers are transferred from the Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility and new sanitary
sewers are transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility. The amount transferred
from Wastewater Utility to Stormwater Utility was $2,028,330 in 2014.
(12) Restatements – Change in Accounting Principle
Effective July 1, 2013, the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), which is the
administrator of the Utilities’ PERF, changed PERF from an agent multiple-employer
retirement plan to a cost-sharing multiple employer retirement plan. This change is effective
for the Utilities beginning January 1, 2014. Due to this change, the Statement of Net Position
does not include a net pension obligation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and a
restatement for change in accounting principle was implemented to eliminate the net pension
obligation reported December 31, 2013 by increasing Total Net Position as of January 1,
2014 by $931,553. This restatement is reflected in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses,
31

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014
and Changes in Net Position for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a restatement
of Total net position – beginning of year.
(13) Risk Management
The City, including the Utilities, retains the risk of loss for claims related to employee health,
on-the-job injury, auto, and general liabilities, while continuing to buy premium insurance for a
number of other risks. The City has established internal service funds to finance these risks.
Interfund premiums are billed monthly on a cost allocation basis most appropriate to the type
of risk involved. An excess policy covers individual health insurance claims in excess of
$250,000 per year and the insurance company assumes the risk when total monthly claims
exceed an amount based upon an aggregate monthly factor. An excess policy for workers
compensation covers individual claims in excess of $150,000 per employee per injury. The
general and auto liability is limited by Indiana government tort liability limits of $700,000 per
person and incident. Liabilities are the responsibility of the City’s internal service funds.
(14) Pension Plan
Public Employees’ Retirement Fund
Plan Description
The Utilities contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund (PERF), a defined-benefit
pension plan. On July 1, 2013 PERF changed from an agent multiple-employer public
employee retirement system to a cost-sharing multiple employer retirement plan. PERF
provides retirement benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. All full-time employees are
eligible to participate in the defined-benefit plan.
State statutes (IC 5-10.2 and 5-10.3) govern, through the Indiana Public Retirement System
(INPRS) Board, most requirements of the system and give the Utilities authority to contribute to
the plan. PERF retirement benefits consist of employer provided contributions plus an annuity
provided by the member’s annuity savings account. The annuity savings account consists of
member’s contributions, set by statute at three percent of compensation, plus the interest
credited to the member’s account. The employer may elect to make the contributions on behalf
of the member.
INPRS administers the plan and issues a publicly available financial report that includes
financial statements and required supplementary information of the plan as a whole and for its
participants. The report is available online at http://www.inprs.in.gov or may be obtained by
contacting:
Indiana Public Retirement System
One North Capitol Street, Suite 001
Indianapolis, IN 46204
Ph. (888) 526-1687
32

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014
Retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Normal retirement is defined as the
earliest of: (1) age 65 with 10 years of creditable service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of creditable
service; or (3) the sum of age and creditable service equal to 85, but not earlier than age 55. A
reduced benefit will be received if an employee takes early retirement between the ages of 50
and 65 and has had 15 or more years of creditable service. Employees may elect to either
receive a lump-sum distribution of their annuity savings account balance upon retirement or
receive an annuity amount as a monthly supplement to the retirement benefits described
above. PERF also provides death and disability benefits. These benefit provisions and all
other requirements are established by state statute and ordinance.
Funding Policy and Annual Pension Cost
PERF members are required to contribute three percent of their annual covered salary. The
Utility is required to contribute at an actuarially determined rate; the rate for 2014 is 11.2
percent of the annual covered payroll. The contribution requirements of plan members and
the Utility are established and may be amended by the INPRS Board of Trustees. The
Utilities’ contributions to the plan for the years ending December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
were $2,196,819, $1,912,301 and $1,913,087 respectively, which were equal to the required
amount for each year.
(15) Commitments and Contingencies
Consent Decree:
The Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system does not comply with federal Clean
Water regulations. After several years of negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the EPA lodged
a Consent Decree with the federal court on December 28, 2007. The Consent Decree became
effective April 1, 2008. Under the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree, the Utilities
committed to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) days in a typical year to
one day on the St. Joseph River and four days on the St. Mary’s and Maumee Rivers. The
infrastructure cost to reduce the number of CSO events is approximately $240 million, to be
spent over the next 18 years, concluding in 2025. The Utilities also agreed to eliminate three
known sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated combined cost of $31 million by specific dates
noted in the Consent Decree. Additionally, the Utilities committed to maintain the entire sewer
system to performance standards prescribed in the Utilities’ Long-Term Control Plan
incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree. The Consent Decree further provides for
stipulated penalties for failure to achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines
or maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with the Consent Decree’s terms
and conditions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
As management of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), we offer readers of
the Utilities’ financial statements, this narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the Utilities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011
and 2010. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in
conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in the basic
financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements.
Financial Highlights
•

The assets of the Utilities exceeded its liabilities as of December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009 by $506.7 million, $481.6 million and $465.4 million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ net assets increased for the years ended December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009 by $25.1 million, $16.2 million and $16.5 million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ added new bonded debt and long-term notes payable for
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $69.4 million, $44.2
million and $31.4 million, respectively. The 2011 increase in debt consists
of two new Water SRF loans, one new Wastewater Revenue Bond, one
new Wastewater SRF loan and additional withdrawals against existing
SRF loans.

•

The Utilities’ investment in capital assets for the years ended December
31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 increased approximately $27.2 million, $40.3
million and $34.0 million, respectively. Significantly, the Utilities met all
2009-2011 capital investment milestones required by the 2008 Federal
Consent Decree.

•

The 35 year Electric Light lease expired in February 2010. In October
2010, the City entered into an agreement with the former lessee to
transfer the remaining leased assets of the Electric Utility in exchange for
a multi-year compensation package in excess of $39 million over 15
years. In August 2011, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ratified
the transfer agreement.

Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the Utilities’ basic financial
statements. The Utilities are governmental entities classified as enterprise funds,
3

subsets of proprietary funds. When an entity charges a fee to cover the entire
cost of its operation, these services are classified as a proprietary fund. And
more specifically, when an entity is self-supported completely by providing
services to outside customers, it is an enterprise fund. An enterprise fund’s
financial statements are comprised of three statements and the accompanying
notes to these statements. The three statements are: 1) statement of net assets,
2) statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net assets and 3) statement
of cash flows. The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full
understanding of the data provided in the Utilities’ financial statements. The
notes can be found on pages 16-40 of this report.
The Utilities provide water, wastewater, stormwater, electric, and yard waste
services. The Utilities’ financial statements have been prepared to reflect the
activity of each of these services. The Electric Utility generation and distribution
systems were leased to a private firm in 1975. Portions of the lease payments
are directed by Common Council ordinance into the Community Trust.

Financial Analysis
As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
governmental unit’s financial health. In the case of the Utilities, assets exceeded
liabilities by $506.7 million, $ 481.6 million and $465.4 million as of December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The largest portion (81.4%) of the Utilities’
net assets in 2011 reflects its investment in capital assets (land, buildings,
machinery, equipment and distribution and collection infrastructure), less any
related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.
Another significant portion of the Utilities’ net assets ($68.5 million, or 13.5%)
represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be
used.

5

The Utilities net assets increased $25.1 million, $16.2 million and $16.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net asset
growth in 2011 was more than 2010 by $8.9 million as follows:
•

•
•

Operating income in 2011 was $6.2 million more than 2010.
Overall revenues increased $7.7 million or 8.8%. Wastewater rates
increased 11% effective July 1, 2011. Expenses increased $1.5
million or 2.4%. Depreciation (driven by heavy infrastructure
investments), staffing increases associated with the delivering the
requirement of the 2008 Federal Consent Decree and increased
cost of employee benefits account for the increase in expenses.
Capital contributions in 2011 were $1.7 million more than 2010.
Capital contributions are principally the value of infrastructure
donated to the Utilities by local area developers.
Nonoperating net expenses were $0.7 million less than the prior
year.
o Investment income decreased in 2011 from 2010 by $5.6
million, predominately from equity market fluctuations.
Community Trust funds invest in marketable securities.
o Loss on disposal of assets was $1.2 million more than the
prior year. Certain assets were retired earlier than their
estimated useful life to accommodate new structures for
CSO solutions.
o Net gain from the installment sale of the Electric Utility
assets was $7.6 million in 2011.

Capital Assets and Capital Improvement Program
The Utilities total capital assets in service are $862.7 million with an accumulated
depreciation of $264.1 million for a net book value of $598.6 million. The
statement of net assets also includes $44.7 million in construction in progress
reflecting capital projects in various stages of completion. During 2011,
approximately $27.2 million was spent on capital investments.
Debt
At December 31, 2011, the Utilities had approximately $298.9 million in bonds
and loans payable, an increase of $55.3 million over last year.
The Utilities closed on four new long-term bond/loan issues in 2011. Other than
the smaller $3.1 million water loan, the bonds finance significant capital
expenditures. The smaller water loan cash funded debt service reserves that
were previously funded by surety bond insurance. The underlying insurers failed
to emerge from the 2008-2009 recession with the requisite AAA/aaa status
causing the water utility to cash fund the debt service reserve. The new
bond/loan issues in 2011 were:

6

- An open market wastewater revenue bond for $38.1 million payable
over 15 years at 2.8%.
- A traditional SRF wastewater loan for up to $33.6 million @ 2.29%
payable over 20 years.
- A SRF shared pool water loan for $26.9 million, payable over 20 years
@ 2.967% interest.
- A SRF traditional taxable water loan for $3.1 million @ 3.746% interest,
payable over three years.
The Utilities paid principal of $31.9 million and $31.1 million in 2011 and 2010
respectively.
In February 2011, the Utilities issued a Bond Anticipation Note (BAN4) of $17.8
million payable within a year with interest at 0.65%. The proceeds were used to
retire a Bond Anticipation Note previously issued February 2010. Subsequently,
BAN4 was refinanced by another Bond Anticipation Note for $17.8 million,
payable on or before February 5, 2013 with interest at 0.48%.
Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budget and Rates
•

On December 28, 2007, the Utilities agreed to a Long-Term Control Plan
(LTCP), in the form of a federal Consent Decree, which will ultimately bring
the Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system into compliance with
the federal Clean Water Act. The Consent Decree became effective April 1,
2008. The Utilities committed to combined sewer overflow reductions that
require an approximate investment of $240.0 million (denominated in 2005
dollars) in infrastructure solutions over the next 18 years. The Utilities also
agreed to:
o Eliminate three sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated cost of $31.0
million.
o Maintain the entire storm and sewer systems to performance
standards prescribed in the LTCP.
o Mitigate assessed penalties with local investments in septic tank
elimination subsidies and rain garden stipends.
The Consent Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to
achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines or
maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with terms and
conditions of the Consent Decree.
Consistent with the long term nature of the Consent Decree, Fort Wayne City
Council (Council) approved a five year rate proposal that generally increased
wastewater unit rates by approximately 25% effective July 1, 2009 and again
on July 1, 2010-2013 of each year by 15%, 11%, 9% and 9%, respectively.

7

At that same time, Council authorized the issuance of up to $255 million in
debt to fund a six year capital plan that will accomplish a significant portion of
the infrastructure investment required to fulfill the requirements of the
Consent Decree. The Utilities has issued $146.8 million debt associated with
the $255 million Council authorization.
The Utilities are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Consent Decree. Significantly, the Utilities completed: the upgrade to the
Wastewater plant primaries, completed the pilot testing for the capture and
disposal of floatables and completed eight combined sewer separation
projects. The Utilities also constructed a backflow process that fully treats
nearly 1 billion gallons of wastewater per year that previously entered the
Maumee River only partially treated. Untreated wastewater storage capacity
was increased by nearly 100 million gallons through several CSO pond
enhancement projects.
The wastewater treatment plant upgrade ultimately will treat up to 85 million
gallons per day (mgd), up from 60 mgd. In early 2012, the plant achieved its
interim milestone and is operational at 70 mdg.
Lining wastewater pipelines significantly extends the life of the pipeline,
improves overall system flow and reduces reactive maintenance. Since 2008,
the Utilities have invested $12.0 million to line approximately 58 miles of pipe.
The replacement rate over the previous four years is right at our annual goal
of 1% per year.
•

In June 2002, the Utilities initiated a condemnation action of Aqua Indiana’s
North Assets. On February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16.9
million, the appraised value, and took possession of those assets. The North
Assets were quickly integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer system and
began generating revenues at existing rates from 8,600 new retail water
customers and 1,600 new retail sewer customers. Aqua Indiana asserts that
the purchase price is inadequate and has sued for unspecified damages.

•

The City entered into an agreement to transfer the remaining leased Electric
Utility assets to another electric utility (Transferee). In August 2011, the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved the agreement. In
exchange for the remaining leased Electric Utility assets and the right to be
the exclusive supplier of electricity in the City, the Transferee agreed to pay
the City in excess of $39 million over the next 15 years, including an initial
payment of $5 million in 2011.

•

The Water Utility successfully acquired SRF funding in 2011 for an ultra-violet
disinfection system (UV system) valued at nearly $20 million. The UV system
was selected as the optimal incremental disinfection methodology to comply

8

with an EPA mandate; the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatement
Rule. This timely funding allows for the completion and testing of the UV
system before the enforcement date of April 2014.
•

In early 2012, the Fort Wayne City Council authorized a 39.7% water rate
increase to be implemented in three phases starting in January 2013. The
Council further authorized the issue of up to $40 million in bonding. The
increased rates and the bonding will provide funding for many repair and
replacement projects but, significantly, up to 40 miles of water main
replacement. Water main breaks have steadily increased in recent years and
funding for our water main replacement program was significantly inadequate.
The new rates and bond will allow us to achieve our goal to replace 1%, or
ten miles, of our water main pipelines per year

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2011 and 2010
(1) Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Entity
The City of Fort Wayne Utilities (the Utilities) are included in the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana
reporting entity pursuant to the entity definition criteria contained in the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 14.
The Utilities consist of Water, Wastewater, Stormwater, and Electric utilities in addition to the
Yard Waste facility. All five areas are considered proprietary in nature. The electric utility
generation and distribution systems were leased to a private firm in 1975.
Basis of Accounting and Financial Reporting
The Utilities prepare their financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as
applied to governmental units. The Utilities elected, under GASB Statement 20, not to apply
statements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) after November 30,
1989.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses and other changes in net assets during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the combined statement of cash flows, the Utilities consider all highly liquid
investments (including restricted assets) with maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments are stated at fair value, except for short-term (less than one year), highly liquid
investments (i.e. Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, etc.), which are reported at
cost or amortized cost.
Restricted Assets/Net Assets
All restricted assets/net assets, as presented in the accompanying financial statements, are
restricted due to enabling legislation.
16

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2011 and 2010
Capital Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes interest incurred during
construction periods. Donated property, plant and equipment are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of donation. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not
add to the value of the asset or materially extend the assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
When an individual asset is retired, depreciation is calculated. The difference between the
original cost and the calculated depreciation results in a recognized loss.
Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Yard Waste Utilities’ assets are depreciated by
individual asset. Electric Utility assets not under lease are depreciated using the group
method. Depreciation of leased Electric Utility assets is calculated annually by dividing net
assets by the years remaining on the 35-year lease.
Estimated useful lives, in years, are as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Equipment and other
Distribution and collection

Net interest cost incurred on borrowed funds for the Water, Wastewater and Stormwater
Utilities is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction. Net interest capitalized for
the Water Utility was $632,292 and $217,511 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net interest
capitalized for the Wastewater Utility was $3,338,138 and $2,946,045 in 2011 and 2010,
respectively. Net interest capitalized for the Stormwater Utility was $167,499 and $241,788 in
2011 and 2010, respectively.
Unbilled Utility Revenue
The Water Utility accrues revenue for estimated water distributed but not yet billed as of the
balance sheet date. Likewise, the Wastewater Utility and Stormwater Utility accrue revenue
for estimated wastewater and stormwater service not yet billed as of such date.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies are stated at cost (average cost for the Water Utility; first-in, first-out
for the Wastewater Utility). Amounts for Stormwater, Electric and Yard Waste are immaterial
and not reported.

Bond

Issuance

Costs,

Discounts

and Premiums

Bond issuance costs, discounts and premiums are amortized over the lives of the respective
bond issues using the interest method.
Compensated Absences
Employees earn vacation at rates from ten days to twenty-five days per year, based on the
number of years of service. One year of unused vacation leave may be carried over to the
next. Unpaid vacation pay is recorded as a liability as the benefits accrue to the employee.
Accrued compensated absences for Utilities’ personnel are charged as an operating
expense, using the vesting method, based on earned but unused vacation and sick leave
days including the Utilities’ share of social security and medicare taxes.
Unused sick leave may be carried over from year to year. City employees must have
completed ten years of service to receive payment for unused sick leave. Unused sick leave
payoffs are calculated as follows: (1) $1.00 for each hour up to 520 hours, plus (2) 50% of the
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate times each sick leave hour over 520. In lieu of
item “2” above, the employee may receive credit at the rate of 100% of the employee’s
normal straight time hourly rate for each sick leave hour over 520 if used to purchase group
health insurance; with any remaining hours paid to the employee at the rate of 50% of
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate. There is a $25,000 limit on the amount paid for
sick time accrual. Council approved exceptions to this limit in 2000. The liability recorded for
unused sick leave is an estimate based on prior experience of the actual payoff method
chosen.
Classification of Revenue
The Utilities have classified their revenue as either operating or nonoperating according to the
following criteria:
-

Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange
transactions, such as customer charges and lease payments.

-

Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange
transactions, such as contributions and other revenue sources that are defined as
nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and
Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Government Entities That Use Proprietary Fund
Accounting, and GASB Statement 34, such as investment income.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2010 financial statements to conform to the
2011 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the results of the operations.
(2) Deposits and Investments
Deposits
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government’s deposits
may not be returned to it. Indiana Code 5-13-8-1 allows a political subdivision of the State of
Indiana to deposit public funds in a financial institution only if the financial institution is a
depository eligible to receive state funds; and has a principal office or branch that qualifies to
receive public funds of the political subdivision. The bank balances were insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which covers
all public funds held in approved depositories. The Utilities do not have a formal policy for
custodial credit risk.
Investments
Authorization for investment activity is stated in Indiana Code IC 5-13. The Utilities had the

Investment Policies
Indiana Code 5-13-9 authorizes the Utilities to invest in securities backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Treasury or fully guaranteed by the United States and issued by
the United States Treasury, a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
19

Notes to Financial Statements

government sponsored enterprise. Indiana Code also authorizes the Utilities to invest in
securities fully guaranteed and issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality or a
federal government sponsored enterprise. These investments are required by statute to have
a stated final maturity of not more than two years. Indiana Code also provides for investment
in money market mutual funds that are in the form of securities of or interest in an open-end,
no-load, management-type investment company or investment trust registered under the
provision of the Federal Investment Company act of 1940, as amended. Investments in
money market mutual funds may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the funds held by the
Utilities and available for investment. The portfolio of an investment company or investment
trust used must be limited to direct obligations of the United States, obligations issued by a
federal agency, a federal instrumentality, a federal government sponsored enterprise; or
repurchase agreements fully collateralized by direct obligations of the United States or
obligations issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal government
sponsored enterprise. The form of securities of or interest in an investment company or
investment trust must be rated as AAA, or its equivalent by Standard and Poor’s Corporation
or its successor or Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or its successor.
The form of securities in an investment company or investment trust should have a stated
final maturity of one (1) day.
The Community Trust, which invests in a variety of securities and mutual funds, is not subject
to the requirements of Indiana Statutes governing authorized investments.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of
an investment. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy that limits investment
maturities as a means of managing their exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing
interest rates.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its
obligations. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy for credit risk. The
distribution of securities with credit ratings is summarized below.

Custodial Credit Risk
For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the
counterparty, the Utilities will not be able to recover the value of their investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The Utilities do not have a policy in
regard to custodial credit risk. For investments that are uninsured and 1) uncollateralized, 2)
collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution, or 3) collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institution’s trust department or agent but not in the
government’s name.
Foreign Currency Risk
This risk relates to adverse affects on the fair value of an investment from changes in
exchange rates. The Utilities’ exposure to foreign currency risk derives from their investment
at December 31, 2011 in foreign mutual funds with a fair value of $5,638,939 and at
December 31, 2010 in foreign mutual funds with a fair value of $9,077,556. The Utilities do
not have a policy in regard to foreign currency risk.
Other
Under the City’s cash management program, the Utilities participate in pooled cash account
arrangements for some of their cash and investment activities. Interfund borrowing is shown
as interfund receivables/payables in the accompanying financial statements. Interest income
is allocated to accounts with positive balances.
For the year ending December 31, 2011, the Community Trust had net investment loss of
$1,334,143.
The Trust incurred realized gains of $2,332,535, unrealized losses of
$4,716,198 and cash net income of $1,049,521. For the year ending December 31, 2010,
the Community Trust had a net investment gain of $4,194,485. The Trust incurred realized
gains of $274,066, unrealized gains of $2,813,236 and cash net income of $1,107,183.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2011 and 2010
Sinking Fund
Monthly deposits into sinking fund account for the Sewage Works Utility’s net revenues is
required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual interest payment
and 1/12 of the next annual principal payment. Other related debt service requirements are
held in the debt service account.
Monthly deposits into sinking fund accounts of both the Water and Stormwater Utilities’ net
revenues are required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual
interest payments and 1/12 of the next annual principal payments. Upon meeting certain
minimum balance requirements, transfers may be made to unrestricted cash accounts.
Surety bonds purchased by the Utilities cover the Waterworks and Stormwater Reserve
Accounts requirements.
Debt Service Reserve
In addition to the sinking fund accounts, revenue bonds require debt service “reserve
accounts” which require funding at: the lesser of 10% of bond proceeds, the maximum annual
principal and interest required thereon, or 125% of the average annual principal and interest
requirements thereon. The Utilities calculate its debt service reserve accounts on a
consolidated basis and may fund the debt service reserve by holding cash or through the
purchase of surety bond insurance. Among other requirements, the surety bond insurer must
maintain a AAA or Aaa rating with Standards and Poor’s or Moody’s respectively.
Prior to 2009, all Utility revenue bonds’ debt service reserves were funded through surety
bond insurance except the Sewage Works Junior Revenue Bonds of 1998 A and 1998 B
which were cash funded. As a result of the financial crisis that occurred in late 2008 – early
2009 and up to and including 2010, the surety bond insurers failed to maintain their AAA/Aaa
rating. While still insured, this failure to maintain AAA/Aaa ratings required the Utilities to
cash fund the debt service reserve accounts for the affected revenue bonds. As of December
31, 2011, all surety bond insurance for Waterworks and Sewage Works Revenue Bonds have
been replaced with cash funded debt service reserves as required by bond ordinance.
The surety bond insurer for the Stormwater Management District Revenue Bonds of 2006
has failed to maintain the required AAA/Aaa rating. The appropriate disclosures have been
made to the bondholders and no other action has been taken.
Construction
Unspent bond issue proceeds to be used in the construction of designated capital assets are
included in this account.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2011 and 2010
Airport Expressway
In 2010, Water Utility entered into a tri-lateral agreement with the Redevelopment
Commission and a Developer to construct a water main extension along the airport
expressway. The Redevelopment Commission agreed to advance TIF funds to the Water
Utility at such times so as to pay the Developer according to the contractual payment
schedule. Monies received by the Water Utility prior to the Developer’s payment due date will
be held in a restricted account.
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits are refundable amounts received from Water Utility customers to insure
against nonpayment of billings or water main damages.
Connection Fees
Certain area connection fees are designated for repayment of certain development costs as
well as for reinvestment in specific areas. The unspent connection fees are reported in this
restricted category.
Asset Transfer Contingency
On October 28, 2010, the City entered into an agreement to transfer the remaining Electric
Utility assets to a private electric utility. As part of the agreement, regular monthly installment
payments were received. Until the transfer agreement had received all regulatory approvals,
the payments had forfeiture conditions and as such, were set aside and reported as restricted
assets. The contingent balance as of December 31, 2010 was $1,040,549. This amount was
held in the Wastewater Utility since the Electric Utility used it to partially repay a prior
interfund loan from the Wastewater Utility. The transfer agreement was subsequently
approved in 2011 and all restrictions were lifted (see Note 6).
Septic Elimination Program
In 2009, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works authorized the creation of a City Utilities
Revolving Fund as an alternative funding source for septic tank elimination in Allen County.
This fund provides the funding necessary to construct wastewater mains allowing
homeowners to discontinue use of failing septic tanks and connect to public infrastructure.
The program also provides financial incentives to encourage septic tank elimination. Any
unexpended funds are restricted for future septic tank elimination projects.

(4) Assessments Receivable
Assessments receivable represent assessments due from customers for sewer connections.
The individual assessments range from $2,000 to $24,000 and are due in 120 monthly
principal installments plus interest on the unpaid portion at ranges from 0% to 7% per year.
(5) Community Trust
The City Council established the Community Trust in 1975 to account for a portion of the
proceeds received from a private utility leasing the assets of the Electric Utility (see Note 6).
On February 28, 2010, the Electric Utility’s lease expired. The Community Trust received its
final $270,000 annual deposit in May of 2009 and is no longer entitled to future lease
revenues or sales proceeds under the 1975 authorizing ordinance, also now expired.
The accumulated rents and investment earnings of the Community Trust were meant to
enable the City to reclaim its Electric Utility by reimbursing the private utility for additions,
extensions and betterments upon either default of its obligations under the lease or upon
expiration of the lease.
Under the provisions of the 1975 authorizing ordinance, the corpus of the trust was to be free
from invasion as long as the lease was in force. The lease has expired, the previously leased
Electric Utility assets have been sold (see Note 6) and the corpus of the trust no longer needs
to be held in reserve to reclaim the Electric Utility from the lessor (private utility).
(6) Lease and Subsequent Installment Sale of Electric Utility Assets
The Electric Utility had leased its entire utility system, including power plant, substations, and
transmissions and distribution system, to a private electric utility serving the surrounding
area. The lease term commenced March 1, 1975, and expired on February 28, 2010. Lease
payments of $290,000, including the last lease payment under this lease, were received for
the year ended December 31, 2010.
On October 28, 2010, the City entered into an agreement to transfer the remaining Electric
Utility assets to a private electric utility (Transferee), which had previously leased the assets for
35 years under a lease agreement that expired on February 28, 2010. On August 10, 2011, the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the transfer agreement. Under the terms of

Loans Payable:
Indiana State Revolving Fund Loan Program (SRF) is a program that provides wastewater
and drinking water loans, often at reduced interest rates and reduced issuance costs, to
Indiana cities and towns. SRF “draw-down” loans are awarded as a “not-to-exceed” loan
amount and the amount is later fixed at the amount actually borrowed to complete the preestablished wastewater or drinking water projects. The interest rate is fixed at the time of the
award and the duration is established shortly thereafter. For shared pool loans, SRF
coordinates the financing activities for several Indiana communities and issues bonds on the
open market to provide the funding for each community’s projects. The loan amount, interest
rate and duration are fixed at the time of the consolidated loan’s issuance. Occasionally,
SRF will make traditional loans with fixed rate, amount and duration.
With the exception of the SRF Revenue Bonds of 2008, SRF loans payable are issued on a
parity basis with revenue bonds and are collateralized identically by the net revenues of the
issuing Utility.
Details of all Utilities’ State Revolving Fund (SRF) loans payable at December 31, 2011 are
as follows:

Interfund Receivables / Payables
In 2008, the Water Utility financed the acquisition of the Aqua Indiana assets with
Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 2007. Included in this
acquisition were Wastewater Utility assets valued at approximately $1,407,780. An inter-fund
receivable was set up on the Water Utility and an interfund payable was set up on the
Wastewater Utility for the same amount. The Wastewater Utiliity repaid half of the
outstanding balance during 2011. The interfund payable/receivable was $703,890 and
$1,407,780 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
In 2010, the Wastewater Utility advanced funds to the Electric Utility to satisfy the Electric
Utility’s obligation to the City’s Cumulative Capital Improvement Fund. The short-term loan
has been substantially reduced in 2010 and was fully satisfied in early 2011. The outstanding
balance was $144,151 as of December 31, 2010 and was reported as an interfund receivable
/ payable.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2011 and 2010
In 2011, the Utilities participated in the City’s Commercial Master Lease wherein the
Utilities financed the purchase of rolling stock at a not to exceed value of $1,322,000. The

acquires the rolling stock and then seeks reimbursement from the Lessor with the City acting
as the fiduciary intermediary. As of December 31, 2011, the City is holding $642,273 of the
Utilities cash reimbursement which is reported as Due From City (noted above). Additionally,
the first payment with interest of $140,137 is due and owing to the City and is reported as
Due to City (noted above). Lastly, the Utilities has used approximately 76% of its
commitment and has set up interfund payables to the City for its share of the Commercial

(13) Equity Transfers
The 10-year sewer capacity improvement program includes storm sewer construction funded
through the Wastewater Utility or Stormwater Utility. New storm sewers allow old combined
sewers to be converted to sanitary-only lines. As projects are completed, the new storm
sewers are transferred from the Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility and new sanitary
sewers are transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility. The amount transferred
from Wastewater Utility to Stormwater Utility was $3,925,240 and $492,052 in 2011 and
2010, respectively. The amount transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility was
$77,905 in 2010.
(14) Risk Management
The City, including the Utilities, retains the risk of loss for claims related to employee health,
on-the-job injury, auto, and general liabilities, while continuing to buy premium insurance for a
number of other risks. The City has established internal service funds to finance these risks.
Interfund premiums are billed monthly on a cost allocation basis most appropriate to the type
of risk involved. An excess policy covers individual health insurance claims in excess of
$250,000 per year and the insurance company assumes the risk when total monthly claims
exceed an amount based upon an aggregate monthly factor. An excess policy for workers
compensation covers individual claims in excess of $150,000 per employee per injury. The
general and auto liability is limited by Indiana government tort liability limits of $700,000 per
person and incident. Liabilities are the responsibility of the City’s internal service funds.

December 31, 2011 and 2010
(15) Pension Plans
Public Employees’ Retirement Fund
Plan Description
The Utilities contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund (PERF), a defined-benefit
pension plan. PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system, which
provides retirement benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. All full-time employees are
eligible to participate in the defined-benefit plan.
State statutes (IC 5-10.2 and 5-10.3) govern most requirements of the system and give the
Utilities authority to contribute to the plan. PERF retirement benefits consist of employer
provided contributions plus an annuity provided by the member’s annuity savings account. The
annuity savings account consists of member’s contributions, set by statute at three percent of
compensation, plus the interest credited to the member’s account. The employer may elect to
make the contributions on behalf of the member.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required
supplementary information for the plan as a whole and for its participants. That report may be
obtained by writing the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), One North Capitol Street,
Suite 001, Indianapolis, IN 46204 or by calling (888) 526-1687.
Retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Normal retirement is defined as the earliest
of: (1) age 65 with 10 years of creditable service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of creditable service;
or (3) the sum of age and creditable service equal to 85, but not earlier than age 55. A reduced
benefit will be received if an employee takes early retirement between the ages of 50 and 65
and has had 15 or more years of creditable service. Employees may elect to either receive a
lump-sum distribution of their annuity savings account balance upon retirement or receive an
annuity amount as a monthly supplement to the retirement benefits described above. PERF
also provides death and disability benefits. These benefit provisions and all other requirements
are established by state statute and ordinance.

Funding Policy and Annual Pension Cost
The INPRS Board of Trustees establishes contribution requirements for plan members. The
Utilities’ annual pension cost for years ended 2011 and 2010, and related information as
provided by the actuary, is presented in this note.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies
Consent Decree:
The Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system does not comply with federal Clean
Water regulations. After several years of negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the EPA lodged
a Consent Decree with the federal court on December 28, 2007. The Consent Decree became
effective April 1, 2008. Under the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree, the Utilities
committed to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) days in a typical year to
one day on the St. Joseph River and four days on the St. Mary’s and Maumee Rivers. The
infrastructure cost to reduce the number of CSO events is approximately $240 million, to be
spent over the next 18 years, concluding in 2025. The Utilities also agreed to eliminate three
known sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated combined cost of $31 million by specific dates
noted in the Consent Decree. Additionally, the Utilities committed to maintain the entire sewer
system to performance standards prescribed in the Utilities’ Long-Term Control Plan
incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree.
The EPA assessed penalties of $842,109 for violations of the Clean Water Act committed prior
to December 28, 2007. In lieu of cash payment, the Utilities committed to spend $540,000 on
specific environmentally beneficial projects over the next seven years. A cash penalty payment
of $297,636 including accrued interest of $1,527 was made April 30, 2008. The Consent
Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to achieve specified construction
milestones, reporting deadlines or maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance
with the Consent Decree’s terms and conditions.
Condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets:
In June, 2002, the Utilities initiated condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets. On February
12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16,910,500 and took possession of those condemned
assets. The acquisition was financed by Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond Anticipation Notes,
Series 2007 (BAN) issued February 5, 2008 for $17,840,000, including the purchase price and
estimated issuance and integration costs. The BAN has been subsequently refinanced four
times the last of which is detailed in the subsequent events footnote (see Note 17). The North
Assets are now fully integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer systems and generating
revenues for the respective Utilities at standard system-wide tariffs.
The purchase price was established through condemnation proceedings by Fort Wayne Board
of Public Works and is currently being contested by Aqua Indiana in Wells County Circuit Court.
At this time, the Utilities are unable to form a conclusion as to whether the assertion of further
action by Aqua Indiana is either probable or remote, nor as to the amount of damages if
assessed, nor to the possible costs of the corrective action, if any.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
As management of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), we offer readers of
the Utilities’ financial statements, this narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the Utilities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in
conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in the basic
financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements.
Financial Highlights
•

The assets of the Utilities exceeded its liabilities as of December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 by $442.8 million, $421.1 million and $405.1 million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ net assets increased for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 by $21.7 million, $16.0 million and $21.2 million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ added new bonded debt and long-term notes payable for
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $38.2 million, $68.4
million and $17.9 million, respectively. The 2007 increase in debt consists
of one new Sewer Revenue Bond and additional withdrawals against
existing SRF loans.

•

The Utilities’ invested in capital assets for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 increased approximately $47.3 million, $53.5 million
and $33.0 million, respectively. Significantly, in 2007:
o Net capital assets passed the half billion dollar milestone.
o Invested an additional $13.4 million in the Primaries - phase II of a
comprehensive improvement to our wastewater treatment plant.
The Primaries’ investment has used $32.0 million of the total $40
million SRF commitment.
o In addition to the investment in the Primaries, another $4.5 million
was invested in the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) program.
The CSO program is an extensive ongoing list of projects that will
reduce the volume of discharges directly to the rivers as well as
reduce the risk of basement backups. The Primaries upgrade
provides additional capacity essential to CSO solutions.

3

o Over $3.5 million was invested in water and sewer main
replacement and/or rehabilitation.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the Utilities’ basic financial
statements. The Utilities are governmental entities classified as enterprise funds,
subsets of proprietary funds. When an entity charges a fee to cover the entire
cost of its operation, these services are classified as a proprietary fund. And
more specifically, when an entity is self-supported completely by providing
services to outside customers, it is an enterprise fund. An enterprise fund’s
financial statements are comprised of three statements and the accompanying
notes to these statements. The three statements are: 1) statement of net assets,
2) statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net assets and 3) statement
of cash flows. The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full
understanding of the data provided in the Utilities’ financial statements. The
notes can be found on pages 16-38 of this report.
The Utilities provide water, wastewater, stormwater, electric, and yard waste
services. The Utilities’ financial statements have been prepared to reflect the
activity of each of these services. The Electric Utility generation and distribution
systems were leased to a private firm in 1975. Portions of the lease payments
are directed by Common Council ordinance into the Community Trust.

Financial Analysis
As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
governmental unit’s financial health. In the case of the Utilities, assets exceeded
liabilities by $442.8 million, $ 421.1 million and $405.1 million as of December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The largest portion (86.4%) of the Utilities’
net assets in 2007 reflects its investment in capital assets (land, buildings,
machinery, equipment and distribution and collection infrastructure), less any
related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.

5

Another significant portion of the Utilities’ net assets ($110.3 million, or 25.0%)
represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be
used.
The Utilities net assets increased $21.7 million, $16.0 million and $21.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net asset
growth in 2007 was more than 2006 by $5.7 million as follows:
•

•

•

Operating income in 2007 was $8.3 million more than 2006. After a
lengthy period without a rate increase, water rates generally
increased 25% effective September 1, 2006 and sewer rates
generally increased 25% effective March 1, 2007.
Overall
revenues increased $10.3 million or 15.6%. Expenses increased
3.9%; tracking generally with the overall rate of inflation for 2007.
Capital contributions in 2007 were $2.5 million less than 2006.
Capital contributions are principally the value of infrastructure
donated to the Utilities by local area developers and are down;
consistent with the housing market slump.
Interest income increased in 2007 over 2006 by $1.1 million as
investible cash increased from new debt activity. Interest expense
increased nearly $0.9 million between 2007 and 2006 as
outstanding long-term debt increased nearly $27.2 million.

Capital Assets and Capital Improvement Program
The Utilities total capital assets in service are $656.9 million with an accumulated
depreciation of $227.4 million for a net book value of $429.5 million. The
statement of net assets also includes $79.0 million in construction in progress
reflecting capital projects in various stages of completion. To continue to deliver
high quality services and comply with EPA and other regulatory agencies, the
Utilities need to invest in new capital and capital improvement programs. As
noted in 2006, the Utilities achieved an important milestone in its completion of
the replacement of the preliminary wastewater treatment facility (the Headworks;
$23 million investment). Last year, the Utilities kicked off phase II of a $32 million
Primaries project and that phase is expected to be operational in the 4th quarter
2008. The Utilities also made important investments in many other projects,
particularly those that reduce the number of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO’s)
and the volume of discharges directly to the rivers as well as main
replacement/rehab. During 2007, approximately $45.3 million was spent on
capital investments.
The Utilities regularly conduct long-range studies to evaluate service quality and
capability. Additional significant investments in capital are anticipated to
continue: to replace the preliminary treatment facilities and upgrade the
secondary facilities at the Water Pollution Control Plant, to implement projects to
reduce the number of CSO’s and the volume of discharges directly to the rivers,

6

to improve Combined Sewer Capacity to reduce the risk of basement backups, to
replace six miles of water mains per year, to increase finished water storage
capacity and to insure uninterrupted service of finished water through fail-safe
security, strategic redundancy and the development of emergency electrical
back-up systems for key pump stations and the treatment plants.
Debt
At December 31, 2007, the Utilities had approximately $182.8 million in bonds
and loans payable, an increase of $27.2 million over last year. A new revenue
bond was issued by the Sewer Utility for $24.2 million in May 2007. Additionally,
the Wastewater Utility increased its draw against a $40.0 million maximum
financial assistance agreement with the State of Indiana’s Wastewater Revolving
Loan Program (2005 SRF) by $14.1 million, for a total withdrawal-to-date of
$33.9 million. The total proceeds withdrawn from the 2005 SRF are classified as
long-term loan payable and, after principal payments, totaled $30.9 million as of
December 31, 2007.
In December 2006, the Water Utility entered into a separate, slightly different
SRF agreement referred to as their “Shared Loan Program”. Under the “Shared
Loan Program,” municipalities collectively borrow under the AAA rating of the
State of Indiana’s creditworthiness. The Water Utility borrowed $31.9 million
under this program at a favorable 3.95% interest rate and reduced debt issuance
costs. This debt is also classified as a long-term loan payable.
Economic Factors and Next Years Budget and Rates
•

On December 28, 2007, the Utilities tentatively agreed to a Long-Term
Control Plan (LTCP), in the form of a federal Consent Decree, which will
ultimately bring the Utilities’ storm and sanitary sewer system into compliance
with the federal Clean Water Act. The Consent Decree became effective
April 1, 2008. The Utilities committed to combined sewer overflow reductions
that require an approximate investment of $240.0 million in infrastructure
solutions over the next 18 years. The Utilities also agreed to:
o Eliminate three sanitary sewer overflows by 2014 at an estimate cost
of $31.0 million.
o Maintain the entire storm and sewer systems to performance
standards prescribed in the LTCP.
o Pay assessed penalties of $0.8 million in cash and local investments.
The Consent Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to
achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines or
maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with terms and
conditions of the Consent Decree.

7

•

Prior to the official filing of the Consent Decree on December 28, 2007, the
Utilities invested in plant solutions that will increase the wastewater plant’s
capacity from the current 60 million gallons per day (mgd) to 85 mgd and will
be instrumental in the battle to reduce combined sewer overflows. Over the
four years ended in 2005, proceeds from the 2002 SRF loan were used to
construct the new Headworks, the first improvement project to upgrade the
wastewater treatment plant. The Headworks project replaces and expands
the capacity of the 1940’s raw wastewater pump station and grit removal
facilities. The Headworks successfully went into production in early 2005. In
October of 2005, the SRF approved funding for the design and construction of
the Primaries, the next improvement project to upgrade the wastewater
treatment plant. This phase will rebuild the primary settling tanks (1940’s and
1960’s construction) at a preliminary estimated cost of $37.5 million.
Construction started last year, investing nearly $32.0 million in the project by
the end of 2007 and will be operational in the 4th quarter of 2008.

•

The Utilities will continue to pursue the goal to design and construct six miles
of water main replacement and five miles of sewer rehabilitation work.

•

The Utilities have entered into several local land developer financed water
and wastewater main projects over that last five years ended 2007. The
developers construct new wastewater and water capacity in newly developing
service areas. The collection systems are turned over to the Utilities in
exchange for future area sourced connections fees and surcharges (see note
9).

•

As noted above, the Utilities have significantly increased its long-term debt to
accomplish important and necessary improvements to its plants and its
distribution, drainage and collection systems. Debt-to-asset ratios measure
financial leverage and the Utilities believe that a ratio over 50% is excess risk.
The Utilities’ ratios are well below that threshold.

Prior to 2006, the Utilities had not had a rate increase since July 2001.
Effective September 1, 2006, the Water Utility generally increased its rates
25%. The Sewer Utility generally increased its rates 25% effective March 1,
2007. These rate increases will pay for increased debt service, inflationary
increases in expenses, new regulatory compliance costs and additional
infrastructure investments. No rate increases are anticipated for 2008.

•

In June 2002, the Utilities initiated a condemnation action of Aqua Indiana’s
North Assets. On February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16.9
million and took possession of those condemned assets. The North Assets
are now fully integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer system and
generating revenues at existing rates from 9,000 new retail water customers
and 1,600 new retail sewer customers. Aqua Indiana asserts that the
purchase price is inadequate and has sued for unspecified damages. The
purchase price was financed by a 12 month Bond Anticipation Note. The
Utilities intend to obtain permanent financing if and when the price is either
adjusted or confirmed by the courts.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006

(1) Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Entity
The City of Fort Wayne Utilities (the Utilities) are included in the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana
reporting entity pursuant to the entity definition criteria contained in the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) Statement 14.
The Utilities consist of Water, Wastewater, Stormwater, and Electric utilities in addition to the
Yard Waste facility. All five areas are considered proprietary in nature. The electric utility
generation and distribution systems were leased to a private firm in 1975.
Basis of Accounting and Financial Reporting
The Utilities prepare their financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as applied to
governmental units. The Utilities elected, under GASB Statement 20, not to apply statements
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) after November 30, 1989.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues, expenses and other changes in net assets during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the combined statement of cash flows, the Utilities consider all highly liquid
investments (including restricted assets) with maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments are stated at fair value, except for short-term (less than one year), highly liquid
investments (i.e. Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, etc.), which are reported at
cost or amortized cost.
Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by bond indentures and other legal requirements for debt
retirement, capital improvements and refunds of customer deposits.

16

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006

When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the primary
government’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are
needed.
Capital Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes interest incurred during
construction periods. Donated property, plant and equipment are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of donation. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not
add to the value of the asset or materially extend the assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
When an individual asset is retired, depreciation is calculated. The difference between the
original cost and the calculated depreciation results in a recognized gain or loss.
In 2007, Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Yard Utilities’ assets are depreciated by
individual asset and Electric Utility’s assets not under lease are depreciated using the group
method. In 2006, Water, Wastewater, Stormwater, and Electric Utilities’ assets not under
lease are depreciated using the group method. Depreciation of leased Electric Utility assets
is calculated annually by dividing net assets by the years remaining on the 35-year lease.
Estimated useful lives, in years, are as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Equipment and other
Distribution and collection

Net interest cost incurred on borrowed funds for the Water, Wastewater and Stormwater
Utilities is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction. Net interest capitalized for
the Water Utility was $700,790 and $604,336 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net interest
capitalized for the Wastewater Utility was $1,048,562 and $854,695 in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Net interest capitalized for the Stormwater Utility was $113,132 in 2007.
Unbilled Utility Revenue
The Water Utility accrues revenue for estimated water distributed but not yet billed as of the
balance sheet date. Likewise, the Wastewater Utility and Stormwater Utility accrue revenue
for estimated wastewater and stormwater service not yet billed as of such date.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies are stated at cost (average cost for the Water Utility; first-in, first-out
for the Wastewater Utility). Amounts for Stormwater, Electric and Yard Waste are immaterial
and not reported.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006

Bond Issuance Costs, Discounts and Premiums
Bond issuance costs, discounts and premiums are amortized over the lives of the respective
bond issues using the interest method.
Compensated Absences
Employees earn vacation at rates from ten days to twenty-five days per year, based on the
number of years of service. One year of unused vacation leave may be carried over to the
next. Unpaid vacation pay is recorded as a liability as the benefits accrue to the employee.
Accrued compensated absences for Utilities’ personnel are charged as an operating
expense, using the vesting method, based on earned but unused vacation and sick leave
days including the Utilities’ share of social security and medicare taxes.
Unused sick leave may be carried over from year to year. City employees must have
completed ten years of service to receive payment for unused sick leave. Unused sick leave
payoffs are calculated as follows: (1) $1.00 for each hour up to 520 hours, plus (2) 50% of
the employee’s normal straight time hourly rate times each sick leave hour over 520. In lieu
of item “2” above, the employee may receive credit at the rate of 100% of the employee’s
normal straight time hourly rate for each sick leave hour over 520 if used to purchase group
health insurance; with any remaining hours paid to the employee at the rate of 50% of
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate. There is a $25,000 limit on the amount paid for
sick time accrual. Council approved exceptions to this limit in 2000. The liability recorded for
unused sick leave is an estimate based on prior experience of the actual payoff method
chosen.
Classification of Revenue
The Utilities have classified their revenue as either operating or nonoperating according to
the following criteria:
-

Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange
transactions, such as customer charges and lease payments.

-

Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange
transactions, such as contributions and other revenue sources that are defined as
nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and
Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Government Entities That Use Proprietary Fund
Accounting, and GASB Statement 34, such as investment income.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2006 financial statements to conform to the
2007 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the results of the operations.
(2) Deposits and Investments
Deposits
The Utilities’ deposits with financial institutions at year-end were entirely insured by federal
depository insurance or by the Indiana Public Deposits Insurance Fund. This includes any
deposit accounts issued or offered by a qualifying financial institution.
Investments
Authorization for investment activity is stated in Indiana Code IC 5-13. The Utilities had the
following investments at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Investment Policies
Indiana Code 5-13-9 authorizes the Utilities to invest in securities backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Treasury or fully guaranteed by the United States and issued by
the United States Treasury, a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. Indiana Code also authorizes the Utilities to invest in
securities fully guaranteed and issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality or a
federal government sponsored enterprise. These investments are required by statute to
have a stated final maturity of not more than 2 years. Indiana Code also provides for
investment in money market mutual funds that are in the form of securities of or interest in an
open-end, no-load, management-type investment company or investment trust registered

19

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006

under the provision of the federal Investment Company act of 1940, as amended.
Investments in money market mutual funds may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the funds
held by the Utilities and available for investment. The portfolio of an investment company or
investment trust used must be limited to direct obligations of the Unites States, obligations
issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, a federal government sponsored
enterprise; or repurchase agreements fully collateralized by direct obligations of the United
States or obligations issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. The form of securities of or interest in an investment
company or investment trust must be rated as AAA, or its equivalent by Standard and Poor’s
Corporation or its successor or Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or its
successor. The form of securities in an investment company or investment trust should have
a stated final maturity of one (1) day.
The Community Trust, which invests in a variety of securities and mutual funds, is not subject
to the requirements of Indiana Statutes governing authorized investments.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of
an investment. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy that limits investment
maturities as a means of managing their exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing
interest rates.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its
obligations. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy for credit risk. The
distribution of securities with credit ratings is summarized below.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government’s
investment in a single issuer. The Utilities do not have a policy in regards to concentration of
credit risk. U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities are exempt from this
policy requirement.
Custodial Credit Risk
For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the
counterparty, the Utilities will not be able to recover the value of their investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The Utilities do not have a policy in
regards to custodial credit risk.
Foreign Currency Risk
This risk relates to adverse affects on the fair value of an investment from changes in
exchange rates. The Utilities’ exposure to foreign currency risk derives from their investment
at December 31, 2007 in a foreign bond mutual fund with a fair value of $1,789,040 and at
December 31, 2006 in a foreign bond mutual fund with a fair value of $1,584,021. The
Utilities do not have a policy in regards to foreign currency risk.
Other
Under the City’s cash management program, the Utilities participate in pooled cash account
arrangements for some of their cash and investment activities. Interfund borrowing is shown
as interfund receivables/payables in the accompanying financial statements. Interest income
is allocated to accounts with positive balances.

Sinking Fund Accounts
The Sewage Works Junior Revenue Bonds of 1998, A and B Series require monthly deposits
into a sinking fund account of net revenues of the Wastewater Utility in an amount equal to at
least 1/12 of the following calendar year’s principal and interest payments. In addition, a
10% surplus of monthly deposits is required. An amount equal to the maximum annual
principal and interest requirements is also required to be paid into this account, nominally
titled the Sewage Works Reserve Account.
The Sewage Works Junior Revenue Refunding Bonds of 2002 A, B, C, 2003, 2005 and 2007
Series require monthly deposits into a sinking fund account of Wastewater Utility net
revenues in an amount equal to at least 1/12 of the following calendar year’s principal and
interest payments. In addition, a 10% surplus of monthly deposits is required. Surety bonds
purchased by the Utilities cover the Sewer Works Reserve Account requirements.
Monthly deposits into sinking fund accounts of both the Water and Stormwater Utilities’ net
revenues are required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual
interest payments and 1/12 of the next annual principal payments. Upon meeting certain
minimum balance requirements, transfers may be made to unrestricted cash accounts.
Surety bonds purchased by the Utilities cover the Waterworks and Stormwater Reserve
Accounts requirements.
Construction Account
Unspent bond issue proceeds to be used in the construction of designated capital assets.
Replacement Account
This account, required by the Environmental Protection Agency, exists to provide resources
to maintain the capacity and performance of the property of the Wastewater Utility. In 1991,
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management concluded that the account was
underfunded. The Wastewater Utility agreed to fund the account over the remaining life of
the equipment acquired under the grant. It was anticipated the desired balance of
$6,880,000 would be fully funded by December 31, 1997. However, the City Council capped
the account at $6,657,609 as of June 10, 1997. In 2007, the Wastewater Utility spent
$1,086,000 from this Replacement Account. The Account will be replenished from future
operating revenues on a annual straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets acquired.
Depreciation Account
The Water Utility is required to maintain a Depreciation Account in an amount not less than
$1,000,000. However, in the event moneys are withdrawn from the Depreciation Account
leaving a balance of less than $1,000,000, the deficiency shall be restored within eighteen

23

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006

months. On December 31, 2007, the Water Utility’s Operating Fund borrowed $1,000,000
from the Depreciation Account, leaving no monies in the Depreciation Account.
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits are refundable amounts received from Water Utility customers to insure
against nonpayment of billings or water main damages.
Connection Fees
Resources from specific area connection fees to be used for future development costs in
those specific areas are accumulated in this account.
Tank Painting
Resources for elevated tank painting maintenance are accumulated in this account.
(4) Assessments Receivable
Assessments receivable represent assessments due from customers for sewer connections.
A significant portion of the individual assessments range from $2,000 to $2,500 and are due
in 120 monthly principal installments plus interest on the unpaid portion at 7% per year.
(5) Community Trust
The City Council established the Community Trust in 1975 to account for a portion of the
proceeds received from a private utility leasing the assets of the Electric Utility (see Note 6).
The Community Trust receives $270,000 annually from rents in addition to income earned on
the investment of the funds. The funds are meant to enable the City to reclaim its Electric
Utility by reimbursing the private utility for additions and extensions upon default of its
obligations under the lease or upon termination of the lease.
Under the provisions of the ordinance, the corpus of the trust is to be free from invasion as
long as the lease is in force. However, as long as certain provisions are met, including
approval by the citizens of Fort Wayne, the City Council has the ability to amend this
ordinance and permit invasion of the trust corpus.

(6) Lease of Electric Utility
The Electric Utility has leased its entire utility system, including power plant, substations, and
transmissions and distribution system, to a private electric utility serving the surrounding
area. The lease term commenced March 1, 1975, and expires 35 years later in February
2010. There is a 15-year renewal option at that time. Lease payments of $1,740,000 and
$1,740,000 were received for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Under the terms of the agreement, the lessee may make improvements and retire assets in
the system as long as such improvements and retirements do not exceed 5% of the original
cost of the leased property in any one given year. The City of Fort Wayne Common Council
must approve amounts in excess of 5% in any year. Depreciation expense for the leased
assets was $201,834 and $201,900 for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Upon termination of
the lease, the Electric Utility has the first option to purchase those improvements at a cost of
approximately net book value.

(7) Change in Accounting Estimate
Effective January 1, 2007, the Utilities changed their method of depreciation from a group

converted to sanitary-only lines. As projects are completed, the new storm sewers are
transferred from the Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility. In 2007 there was a project
that was funded by the Stormwater Utility and then transferred from the Stormwater Utility to
the Wastewater Utility. The net amount transferred from the Stormwater Utiltiy to the
Wastewater Utility for 2007 was $1,211,794. The net amount transferred from the
Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility for 2006 was $3,815,799.
(14) Risk Management
The City, including the Utilities, retains the risk of loss for claims related to employee health,
on-the-job injury, auto, and general liabilities, while continuing to buy premium insurance for
a number of other risks. The City has established internal service funds to finance these
risks. Interfund premiums are billed monthly on a cost allocation basis most appropriate to
the type of risk involved. An excess policy covers individual health insurance claims in
excess of $150,000 per year and the insurance company assumes the risk when total
monthly claims exceed an amount based upon an aggregate monthly factor. An excess
policy for workers compensation covers individual claims in excess of $150,000 per
employee per injury. The general and auto liability is limited by Indiana government tort
liability limits of $300,000 per person and incident. Liabilities are the responsibility of the
City’s internal service funds.
(15) Pension Plans
A. Public Employees’ Retirement Fund
Plan Description
The Utilities contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund (PERF), a defined-benefit
pension plan. PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system, which
provides retirement benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. All full-time employees are
eligible to participate in the defined-benefit plan.
State statutes (IC 5-10.2 and 5-10.3) govern most requirements of the system and give the
Utilities authority to contribute to the plan. PERF retirement benefits consist of employer
provided contributions plus an annuity provided by the member’s annuity savings account. The
annuity savings account consists of member’s contributions, set by statute at three percent of
compensation, plus the interest credited to the member’s account. The employer may elect to
make the contributions on behalf of the member.

December 31, 2007 and 2006

PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required
supplementary information for the plan as a whole and for its participants. That report may be
obtained by writing the Indiana Public Employees’ Retirement Fund, Harrison Building, Room
800, 143 West Market Street, Indianapolis, IN 46204 or by calling (317) 233-4162.
Retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Normal retirement is defined as the earliest
of: (1) age 65 with 10 years of creditable service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of creditable service;
or (3) the sum of age and creditable service equal to 85, but not earlier than age 55. A reduced
benefit will be received if an employee takes early retirement between the ages of 50 and 65
and has had 15 or more years of creditable service. Employees may elect to either receive a
lump-sum distribution of their annuity savings account balance upon retirement or receive an
annuity amount as a monthly supplement to the retirement benefits described above. PERF
also provides death and disability benefits. These benefit provisions and all other requirements
are established by state statute and ordinance.
Funding Policy and Annual Pension Cost
The PERF Board of Trustees establishes contribution requirements for plan members. The
Utilities’ annual pension cost for years ended 2007 and 2006, and related information as
provided by the actuary, is presented in this note.

B. Municipal Pension Plan
The Utilities also have a defined benefit pension plan (funded on a pay-as-you-go basis)
covering employees who started receiving retirement or disability benefits before July 1976.
For each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Utilities paid annual benefits
of $5,145 to four former employees or survivors. The accrued pension cost for this plan is
$25,629 and $26,958 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies
Consent Decree:
The Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system does not comply with federal Clean
Water regulations. After several years of negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the EPA
lodged a Consent Decree with the federal court on December 28, 2007. The Consent Decree
became effective April 1, 2008. Under the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree, the
Utilities committed to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) days in a typical
year to one day on the St. Joseph River and four days on the St. Mary’s and Maumee Rivers.
The infrastructure cost to reduce the number of CSO events is approximately $240 million, to
be spent over the next 18 years, concluding in 2025. The Utilities also agreed to eliminate
three known sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated combined cost of $31 million by specific
dates noted in the Consent Decree. Additionally, the Utilities committed to maintain the entire
sewer system to performance standards prescribed in the Utilities’ Long-Term Control Plan
incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree.
The EPA assessed penalties of $842,109 for violations of the Clean Water Act committed prior
to December 28, 2007. In lieu of cash payment, the Utilities committed to spend $540,000 on
specific environmentally beneficial projects over the next seven years. A cash penalty payment
of $297,636 including accrued interest of $1,527 was made April 30, 2008. The Consent
Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to achieve specified construction
milestones, reporting deadlines or maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance
with the Consent Decree’s terms and conditions.

Condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets:
In June, 2002, the Utilities initiated condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets. On
February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16,910,500 and took possession of those
condemned assets. The acquisition was financed by Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond
Anticipation Notes, Series 2007 (BAN) issued February 5, 2008 for $17,840,000, including the
purchase price and estimated issuance and integration costs. The BAN has an interest rate of
1.81% and is payable on or before February 4, 2009. The North Assets are now fully
integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer systems and generating revenues for the
respective Utilities at existing rates.

37

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006

The purchase price was established through condemnation proceedings by Fort Wayne Board
of Public Works and is currently being contested by Aqua Indiana in Wells County Circuit
Court. At this time, the Utilities are unable to form a conclusion as to whether the assertion of
action by Aqua Indiana is either probable or remote, nor as to the amount of damages if
assessed, nor to the possible costs of the agreed corrective action.
Light Lease Revenues:
By ordinance, light lease revenues (see note 6) in excess of operating expenses and the
contribution to the Community Trust (see note 5) are required to be transferred to the City’s
Cumulative Capital Fund. As of December 31, the Electric Utility maintained operating cash
balances of $262,711 and $247,514 for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such amounts are
withheld from the City to cover near term operating expenses and, if unspent, will be summarily
remitted to the City.
Other:
The Utilities have entered into many contracts for various construction projects. Remaining
contract payments as of year-end for each utility are as follows:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO: THE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES, ALLEN COUNTY, INDIANA

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of each major enterprise fund of the City
of Fort Wayne Utilities (City Utilities), as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012, and 2011, and
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City Utilities’ basic financial
statements as listed in the Table of Contents.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the City Utilities’ internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statement.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
(Continued)

Opinions
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the respective financial position of each major fund of the City Utilities as of December 31, 2012, and
2011, and the respective changes in financial position and cash flows, thereof and for the years then
ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, as listed in the table of contents, be presented to supplement
the basic financial statements. Such information, although not part of the basic financial statements, is
required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of
financial reporting for placing the financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or
historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the
information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements
and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express
an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
As management of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), we offer readers of
the Utilities’ financial statements, this narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the Utilities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in
conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in the basic
financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements.
Financial Highlights
•

In August 2011, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ratified an
agreement to transfer (sell) all Electric Utility operating assets in exchange
for a multi-year compensation package in excess of $39 million over 15
years. The Utilities recognized a gain of $24.6 million from the transfer.
With the exception of a few non-operating capital assets, the Electric
Utility transferred its net position valued at $61.4 million to the City’s
Community Legacy Fund.

•

The assets of the Utilities exceeded its liabilities (net position) as of
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 by $481.6 million, $525.3 million and
$481.6 million, respectively. The reduction in net position in 2012 reflects
the transfer of $61.4 million to the City.

•

The Utilities’ net position increased (decreased) for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 by ($43.7) million, $43.7 million and
$16.2 million, respectively. Excluding the transfer of $61.4 million to the
City, the Utilities’ net position increased in 2012 by $17.7 million.

•

The Utilities’ added new bonded debt and long-term notes payable for
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 of $100.0 million, $69.4
million and $44.2 million, respectively. The 2012 increase in debt consists
of one new Water Revenue Bond, one new Wastewater Revenue Bond,
one new Wastewater SRF loan and additional withdrawals against existing
SRF loans.
The Utilities were able to take advantage of the recent low interest rate
financial markets and acquire new long term debt in 2012 at rates ranging
from 1.78% to 3.0%. Additionally, refunding bonds issued in late 2012
and early 2013 at rates ranging from 1% to 3% were issued to retire bonds
with interest rates ranging from 4% to 5.5%.

•

The Utilities’ net investment in capital assets for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 increased approximately $57.7
3

million, $27.2 million and $40.3 million, respectively. Significantly, the
Utilities continue to meet all 2009-2012 capital investment milestones
required by the 2008 Federal Consent Decree.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the Utilities’ basic financial
statements. The Utilities are governmental entities classified as enterprise funds,
subsets of proprietary funds. When an entity charges a fee to cover the entire
cost of its operation, these services are classified as a proprietary fund. And
more specifically, when an entity is self-supported completely by providing
services to outside customers, it is an enterprise fund. An enterprise fund’s
financial statements are comprised of three statements and the accompanying
notes to these statements. The three statements are: 1) statement of net
position, 2) statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position and 3)
statement of cash flows. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the Utilities’ financial
statements. The notes can be found on pages 16-41 of this report.
The Utilities provide water, wastewater, stormwater, and yard waste services.
The Utilities’ financial statements have been prepared to reflect the activity of
each of these services. The Electric Utility’s generation and distribution systems
(operating system) were leased to a private firm in 1975 and the entire operating
system was purchased by that private firm in 2011. Since 1975 portions of the
lease payments were accumulated in a Community Trust Fund and that Trust
Fund coupled with the assets generated from the sale of the Electric Utility’s
operating assets were transferred to the City Community Legacy Fund in 2012.

Financial Analysis
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
governmental unit’s financial health. In the case of the Utilities, assets exceeded
liabilities by $481.6 million, $ 525.3 million and $481.6 million as of December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The largest portion (88.1%) of the Utilities’
net assets in 2012 reflects its net investment in capital assets (land, buildings,
machinery, equipment and distribution and collection infrastructure), less any
related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.
Another significant portion of the Utilities’ net position ($35.7 million, or 7.4%)
represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be
used.
The Utilities net position increased/(decreased) ($43.7) million, $43.7 million and
$16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The change in net assets were significantly impacted by the sale of
the Electric Utility’s operating assets in 2011 and the subsequent transfer to the

5

City of the assets generated from the sale coupled with the Community Trust
Fund assets.
•

In 2011, the Electric Utility sold its operating assets in exchange for
a multi-year compensation package in excess of $39 million over
15 years. The Utilities recognized a gain of $24.6 million from the
sale. In 2012 and with the exception of a few non-operating capital
assets, the Electric Utility transferred its net assets valued at $61.4
million to the City’s Community Legacy Fund. Excluding the impact
of the sale of the Electric Utility’s operating assets and the ultimate
transfer of assets generated from the sale coupled with the
Community Trust Fund assets, net position from continuing
operations increased $17.7 million, $19.1 million and $16.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

Capital Assets and Capital Improvement Program
The Utilities total capital assets in service are $893.9 million with an accumulated
depreciation of $282.6 million for a net book value of $611.3 million. The
statement of net assets also includes $89.7 million in construction in progress
reflecting capital projects in various stages of completion. During 2012,
approximately $77.3 million was invested in capital projects.
Debt
At December 31, 2012, the Utilities had approximately $343.8 million in bonds
and loans payable, an increase of $62.8 million over last year.
The Utilities closed on three new long-term bond/loan issues in 2012. Other than
$17.8 million to permanently finance the Water BAN (see Note 9), the bonds’
proceeds were used to fund significant capital expenditures. The new bond/loan
issues in 2012 were:
-

An open market water revenue bond for $40.0 million payable over 20
years at 3.4%.
A traditional SRF wastewater loan for up to $10.4 million @ 1.78%
payable over 20 years.
An open market wastewater revenue bond for $15.5 million over 15
years at 2.50%.

In December 2012, the Utilities issued $19.7 million in refunding revenue bonds
payable over 10 years at 1.45% to advance refund $20.8 million in 2002A and
2002B Wastewater bonds and loans. In doing this, the Utility in effect lowered its
aggregate debt service payment by $4.4 million and realized an economic gain of
$2.4 million (see Note 10).

6

In February 2012, the Utilities issued a Bond Anticipation Note (BAN5) of $17.8
million payable within a year with interest at 0.48%. The proceeds were used to
retire a Bond Anticipation Note previously issued February 2011. Subsequently,
BAN5 was permanently financed with proceeds from 2012 Water revenue bond.
The Utilities paid principal (including the refunding transaction) of $55.1 million
and $31.9 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budget and Rates
•

On December 28, 2007, the Utilities agreed to a Long-Term Control Plan
(LTCP), in the form of a federal Consent Decree, which will ultimately bring
the Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system into compliance with
the federal Clean Water Act. The Consent Decree became effective April 1,
2008. The Utilities committed to combined sewer overflow reductions that
require an approximate investment of $240.0 million (denominated in 2005
dollars) in infrastructure solutions over the next 18 years. The Utilities also
agreed to:
o Eliminate three sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated cost of $31.0
million.
o Maintain the entire storm and sewer systems to performance
standards prescribed in the LTCP.
o Mitigate assessed penalties with local investments in septic tank
elimination subsidies and rain garden stipends.
The Consent Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to
achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines or
maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with terms and
conditions of the Consent Decree.
Consistent with the long term nature of the Consent Decree, Fort Wayne City
Council (Council) approved a five year rate proposal that generally increased
wastewater unit rates by approximately 25% effective July 1, 2009 and again
on July 1, 2010-2013 of each year by 15%, 11%, 9% and 9%, respectively.
At that same time, Council authorized the issuance of up to $265 million in
debt to fund a six year capital plan that will accomplish a significant portion of
the infrastructure investment required to fulfill the requirements of the
Consent Decree. As of December 31, 2012, the Utilities have issued $172.8
million debt associated with the $265 million Council authorization.
Subsequently, the Utilities issued $75.2 million on March 13, 2013 bringing
the total draw against the $265 million authorization to $248 million.
The Utilities are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Consent Decree. Significantly, the Utilities completed: the upgrade to the
wastewater plant primaries, completed the pilot testing for the capture and
7

disposal of floatables and completed eight combined sewer separation
projects. The Utilities also constructed a backflow process that fully treats
nearly 1 billion gallons of wastewater per year that previously entered the
Maumee River only partially treated. Untreated wastewater storage capacity
was increased by nearly 100 million gallons through several CSO pond
enhancement projects.
The wastewater treatment plant upgrade ultimately will treat up to 85 million
gallons per day (mgd), up from 60 mgd. In early 2012, the plant achieved its
interim milestone and operates at 70 mdg.
Lining wastewater pipelines significantly extends the life of the pipeline,
improves overall system flow and reduces reactive maintenance. Since 2008,
the Utilities have invested $17.2 million to line approximately 76 miles of pipe.
The replacement rate over the previous five years is right at our annual goal
of 1% per year.
•

In June 2002, the Utilities initiated a condemnation action of Aqua Indiana’s
North Assets. On February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16.9
million, the appraised value, and took possession of those assets. The North
Assets were quickly integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer system and
began generating revenues at existing rates from 8,600 new retail water
customers and 1,600 new retail sewer customers. Aqua Indiana asserts that
the purchase price is inadequate and has sued for unspecified damages.

•

The Water Utility successfully acquired SRF funding in 2011 for a ultra-violet
disinfection system (UV system) valued at nearly $20 million. The UV system
was selected as the optimal incremental disinfection methodology to comply
with an EPA mandate; the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment
Rule. This UV solution is on schedule for completion before the enforcement
date of April 2014.

•

In 2012, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and Fort Wayne City
Council approved a three year water rate plan increasing water revenues by
33.9%. The water rate increase will be implemented in three annual
increments starting in January 2013. The increased revenues will provide
funding for many repair and replacement projects but, significantly, up to 9
miles of water main replacement each year. As our infrastructure has aged,
funding for our water main replacement program has not kept pace with the
increase in our water main breaks. The new revenues will allow us to
approach our goal to replace 1%, or ten miles, of our water main pipelines per
year

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2012 and 2011
(1) Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Entity
The City of Fort Wayne Utilities (the Utilities) are collectively, a division of the City of Fort
Wayne, Indiana. The Utilities consist of Water, Wastewater, Stormwater, and Electric utilities
in addition to the Yard Waste facility. All five areas are considered proprietary in nature. The
electric utility generation and distribution systems were sold to a private firm in 2010 (see
Note 6).
Basis of Accounting and Financial Reporting
The Utilities prepare their financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as
applied to governmental units.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses and other changes in net assets during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the combined statement of cash flows, the Utilities consider all highly liquid
investments (including restricted assets) with maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments are stated at fair value, except for short-term (less than one year), highly liquid
investments (i.e. Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, etc.), which are reported at
cost or amortized cost.
Restricted Assets/Net Position
All restricted assets/net position, as presented in the accompanying financial statements, are
restricted due to enabling legislation.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2012 and 2011
Capital Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes interest incurred during
construction periods. Donated property, plant and equipment are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of donation. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not
add to the value of the asset or materially extend the assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
When an individual asset is retired, depreciation is calculated. The difference between the
original cost and the calculated depreciation results in a recognized loss.
Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Yard Waste Utilities’ assets are depreciated by
individual asset. Electric Utility assets are depreciated using the group method.
Estimated useful lives, in years, are as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Equipment and other
Distribution and collection

Bond Issuance Costs, Discounts and Premiums
Bond issuance costs, discounts and premiums are amortized over the lives of the respective
bond issues using the interest method.
Compensated Absences
Employees earn vacation at rates from ten days to twenty-five days per year, based on the
number of years of service. One year of unused vacation leave may be carried over to the
next. Unpaid vacation pay is recorded as a liability as the benefits accrue to the employee.
Accrued compensated absences for Utilities’ personnel are charged as an operating
expense, using the vesting method, based on earned but unused vacation and sick leave
days including the Utilities’ share of social security and medicare taxes.
Unused sick leave may be carried over from year to year. City employees must have
completed ten years of service to receive payment for unused sick leave. Unused sick leave
payoffs are calculated as follows: (1) $1.00 for each hour up to 520 hours, plus (2) 50% of
the employee’s normal straight time hourly rate times each sick leave hour over 520. In lieu
of item “2” above, the employee may receive credit at the rate of 100% of the employee’s
normal straight time hourly rate for each sick leave hour over 520 if used to purchase group
health insurance; with any remaining hours paid to the employee at the rate of 50% of
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate. There is a $25,000 limit on the amount paid for
sick time accrual. Council approved exceptions to this limit in 2000. The liability recorded for
unused sick leave is an estimate based on prior experience of the actual payoff method
chosen.
Classification of Revenue
The Utilities have classified their revenue as either operating or nonoperating according to
the following criteria:
-

Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange
transactions, such as customer charges and lease payments.

-

Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange
transactions, such as contributions and other revenue sources that are defined as
nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and
Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Government Entities That Use Proprietary Fund
Accounting, and GASB Statement 34, such as investment income.

(2) Deposits and Investments
Deposits
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government’s deposits
may not be returned to it. Indiana Code 5-13-8-1 allows a political subdivision of the State of
Indiana to deposit public funds in a financial institution only if the financial institution is a
depository eligible to receive state funds; and has a principal office or branch that qualifies to
receive public funds of the political subdivision. The bank balances were insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which covers
all public funds held in approved depositories. The Utilities do not have a formal policy for
custodial credit risk.
Investments
Authorization for investment activity is stated in Indiana Code IC 5-13. The Utilities had the

Investment Policies
Indiana Code 5-13-9 authorizes the Utilities to invest in securities backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Treasury or fully guaranteed by the United States and issued by
the United States Treasury, a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. Indiana Code also authorizes the Utilities to invest in
securities fully guaranteed and issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality or a
federal government sponsored enterprise. These investments are required by statute to
have a stated final maturity of not more than two years. Indiana Code also provides for
investment in money market mutual funds that are in the form of securities of or interest in an
open-end, no-load, management-type investment company or investment trust registered
under the provision of the Federal Investment Company act of 1940, as amended.
Investments in money market mutual funds may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the funds
held by the Utilities and available for investment. The portfolio of an investment company or
investment trust used must be limited to direct obligations of the United States, obligations
issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, a federal government sponsored
enterprise; or repurchase agreements fully collateralized by direct obligations of the United
States or obligations issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. The form of securities of or interest in an investment
company or investment trust must be rated as AAA, or its equivalent by Standard and Poor’s
Corporation or its successor or Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
its successor. The form of securities in an investment company or investment trust should
have a stated final maturity of one (1) day.
The Community Trust, which invests in a variety of securities and mutual funds, is not subject
to the requirements of Indiana Statutes governing authorized investments.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of
an investment. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy that limits investment
maturities as a means of managing their exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing
interest rates.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its
obligations. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy for credit risk. The
distribution of securities with credit ratings is summarized on following page.

Sinking Fund
Monthly deposits into sinking fund account for the Sewage Works Utility’s net revenues is
required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual interest payment
and 1/12 of the next annual principal payment. Other related debt service requirements are
held in the debt service account.
22

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2012 and 2011
Monthly deposits into sinking fund accounts of both the Water and Stormwater Utilities’ net
revenues are required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual
interest payments and 1/12 of the next annual principal payments. Upon meeting certain
minimum balance requirements, transfers may be made to unrestricted cash accounts.
Surety bonds purchased by the Utilities cover the Waterworks and Stormwater Reserve
Accounts requirements.
Debt Service Reserve
In addition to the sinking fund accounts, revenue bonds require debt service “reserve
accounts” which require funding at: the lesser of 10% of bond proceeds, the maximum
annual principal and interest required thereon, or 125% of the average annual principal and
interest requirements thereon. The Utilities calculate its debt service reserve accounts on a
consolidated basis and may fund the debt service reserve by holding cash or through the
purchase of surety bond insurance. Among other requirements, the surety bond insurer
must maintain a AAA or Aaa rating with Standards and Poor’s or Moody’s respectively.
Prior to 2009, all Utility revenue bonds’ debt service reserves were funded through surety
bond insurance except the Sewage Works Junior Revenue Bonds of 1998 A and 1998 B
which were cash funded. As a result of the financial crisis that occurred in late 2008 – early
2009 and up to and including 2010, the surety bond insurers failed to maintain their AAA/Aaa
rating. While still insured, this failure to maintain AAA/Aaa ratings required the Utilities to
cash fund the debt service reserve accounts for the affected revenue bonds. As of December
31, 2012, all surety bond insurance for Waterworks and Sewage Works Revenue Bonds
have been replaced with cash funded debt service reserves as required by bond ordinance.
The surety bond insurer for the Stormwater Management District Revenue Bonds of 2006
has failed to maintain the required AAA/Aaa rating. The appropriate disclosures have been
made to the bondholders and no other action has been taken.
Construction
Unspent bond issue proceeds to be used in the construction of designated capital assets are
included in this account.
Airport Expressway
In 2010, Water Utility entered into a tri-lateral agreement with the Redevelopment
Commission and a Developer to construct a water main extension along the airport
expressway. The Redevelopment Commission agreed to advance TIF funds to the Water
Utility at such times so as to pay the Developer according to the contractual payment
schedule. Monies received by the Water Utility prior to the Developer’s payment due date
will be held in a restricted account.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2012 and 2011
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits are refundable amounts received from Water Utility customers to insure
against nonpayment of billings or water main damages.
Connection Fees
Certain area connection fees are designated for repayment of certain development costs as
well as for reinvestment in specific areas. The unspent connection fees are reported in this
restricted category.
Septic Elimination Program
In 2009, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works authorized the creation of a City Utilities
Revolving Fund as an alternative funding source for septic tank elimination in Allen County.
This fund provides the funding necessary to construct wastewater mains allowing
homeowners to discontinue use of failing septic tanks and connect to public infrastructure.
The program also provides financial incentives to encourage septic tank elimination. Any
unexpended funds are restricted for future septic tank elimination projects.
(4) Assessments Receivable
Assessments receivable represent assessments due from customers for sewer connections.
The individual assessments range from $2,000 to $24,000 and are due in 60, 120 or 180
monthly principal installments plus interest on the unpaid portion at ranges from 0% to 7%
per year.
(5) Community Trust
The City Council established the Community Trust in 1975 to account for a portion of the
proceeds received from a private utility leasing the assets of the Electric Utility (see Note 6).
On February 28, 2010, the Electric Utility’s lease expired. The Community Trust received its
final $270,000 annual deposit in May of 2009 and is no longer entitled to future lease
revenues or sales proceeds under the 1975 authorizing ordinance, also now expired. On
January 1, 2012 the Community Trust was transferred from the Electric Utility to the
Community Legacy Fund, a special revenue fund on the City’s financial statements.
(6) Lease and Subsequent Installment Sale of Electric Utility Assets
The Electric Utility had leased its entire utility system, including power plant, substations, and
transmissions and distribution system, to a private electric utility serving the surrounding
area. The lease term commenced March 1, 1975, and expired on February 28, 2010. Lease
payments of $290,000, including the last lease payment under this lease, were received for
the year ended December 31, 2010.

December 31, 2012 and 2011

On October 28, 2010, the City entered into an agreement to transfer the remaining Electric
Utility assets to a private electric utility (Transferee), which had previously leased the assets for
35 years under a lease agreement that expired on February 28, 2010. On August 10, 2011,
the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the transfer agreement. Under the terms
of the transfer agreement, the City transferred ownership of the remaining leased Electric Utility
assets, relinquished the right to buy back any betterments under the expired lease and will
never again supply electricity within the City of Fort Wayne. The Transferee, in exchange for
the remaining Electric Utility assets and the right to be the exclusive supplier of electricity, paid
an initial payment of $5,786,270. The City paid $555,000 to the Transferee for products and
services provided to the City under the previous lease. The Transferee also agreed to pay to
the City annual payments as per the following table:

For accounting purposes, the asset transfer is being treated as an installment sale. As of
December 31, 2011, total future payments are $30,885,000 of which $1,740,000 is reported as
Installment receivable – current portion. Using an 8.13% discount rate, the 2011 gain from
installment sale was $24,629,200 and the imputed interest from installment sale was
$1,511,290.
On January 1, 2012 Electric Utility balances, with the exception of the net capital assets not
previously leased, were transferred to the City’s Community Legacy Fund. The amount of the
transfer was $61,368,700.

On December 4, 2012 the Wastewater Utility issued $19,675,000 in refunding revenue bonds
with an average interest rate of 1.45% to advance refund $15,107,351 of outstanding 2002A
series SRF Loans with an interest rate of 4.00% annually and $5,720,000 2002B series
bonds with a interest rate range from 3.50% to 5.50%. The net proceeds of $19,742,284 and
local contribution of $1,746,788 were used to purchase U.S. government securities. Those
securities were deposited in an irrevocable trust with an escrow agent to provide for all future
debt service payments on the 2002A loans and 2002B series bonds. As a result, these loans
and bonds are considered to be defeased and the liabilities for those loans and bonds have
been removed from the Statement of Net Position. The 2002A series SRF loans were called
and paid in full in December 2012. The 2002B series bonds were called and repaid in
February 2013. The refunding results in the accounting loss of $283,536, which has been
recognized on the Statement of Net Position as a net reduction of noncurrent bonds payable.
This amount will be amortized using the straight line method and charged to interest expense
over the next 10 years. The Wastewater Utility in effect lowered its aggregate debt service
payment by $4,410,628 over the next 11 years and realized an economic gain (difference
between the present values of the old and new debt service payments) of $2,411,890.

December 31, 2012 and 2011
Loans Payable:
Indiana State Revolving Fund Loan Program (SRF) is a program that provides wastewater
and drinking water loans, often at reduced interest rates and reduced issuance costs, to
Indiana cities and towns. SRF “draw-down” loans are awarded as a “not-to-exceed” loan
amount and the amount is later fixed at the amount actually borrowed to complete the preestablished wastewater or drinking water projects. The interest rate is fixed at the time of the
award and the duration is established shortly thereafter. For shared pool loans, SRF
coordinates the financing activities for several Indiana communities and issues bonds on the
open market to provide the funding for each community’s projects. The loan amount, interest
rate and duration are fixed at the time of the consolidated loan’s issuance. Occasionally,
SRF will make traditional loans with fixed rate, amount and duration.
With the exception of the SRF Revenue Bonds of 2008, SRF loans payable are issued on a
parity basis with revenue bonds and are collateralized identically by the net revenues of the
issuing Utility.

as follows:

Interfund Receivables / Payables
In 2008, the Water Utility financed the acquisition of the Aqua Indiana assets with
Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 2007. Included in this
acquisition were Wastewater Utility assets valued at approximately $1,407,780. An interfund receivable was set up on the Water Utility and an interfund payable was set up on the
Wastewater Utility for the same amount. The Wastewater Utility repaid half of the
outstanding balance during 2011 and the other half in 2012. The interfund payable/
receivable was $703,890 as of December 31, 2011.
In 2011, the Utilities participated in the City’s Commercial Master Lease wherein the Utilities
financed the purchase of rolling stock at a not to exceed value of $1,322,000. The Utilities
will repay the City with interest over the 5 year term of the lease. The Utilities acquires the
rolling stock and then seeks reimbursement from the Lessor with the City acting as the
fiduciary intermediary. The City was holding $307,206 and $642,273 as of December 31,
2012 and 2011, respectively, of the Utilities’ cash reimbursement which is reported as Due
From City (noted above). Additionally, as of December 31, 2011 the first payment with
interest of $140,137 was due and owing to the City and is reported as Due to City (noted
above). Lastly, the Utilities has used approximately 98% of its commitment and has set up
interfund payables to the City for its share of the Commercial Master Lease as follows:

(13) Equity Transfers
The 10-year sewer capacity improvement program includes storm sewer construction funded
through the Wastewater Utility or Stormwater Utility. New storm sewers allow old combined
sewers to be converted to sanitary-only lines. As projects are completed, the new storm
sewers are transferred from the Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility and new sanitary
sewers are transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility. The amount transferred
from Wastewater Utility to Stormwater Utility was $2,992,637 and $3,925,240 in 2012 and
2011, respectively.

(14) Risk Management
The City, including the Utilities, retains the risk of loss for claims related to employee health,
on-the-job injury, auto, and general liabilities, while continuing to buy premium insurance for
a number of other risks. The City has established internal service funds to finance these
risks. Interfund premiums are billed monthly on a cost allocation basis most appropriate to
the type of risk involved. An excess policy covers individual health insurance claims in
excess of $250,000 per year and the insurance company assumes the risk when total
monthly claims exceed an amount based upon an aggregate monthly factor. An excess
policy for workers compensation covers individual claims in excess of $150,000 per
employee per injury. The general and auto liability is limited by Indiana government tort
liability limits of $700,000 per person and incident. Liabilities are the responsibility of the
City’s internal service funds.
(15) Pension Plans
Public Employees’ Retirement Fund
Plan Description
The Utilities contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund (PERF), a defined-benefit
pension plan. PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system, which
provides retirement benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. All full-time employees are
eligible to participate in the defined-benefit plan.
State statutes (IC 5-10.2 and 5-10.3) govern most requirements of the system and give the
Utilities authority to contribute to the plan. PERF retirement benefits consist of employer
provided contributions plus an annuity provided by the member’s annuity savings account. The
annuity savings account consists of member’s contributions, set by statute at three percent of
compensation, plus the interest credited to the member’s account. The employer may elect to
make the contributions on behalf of the member.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required
supplementary information for the plan as a whole and for its participants. That report may be
obtained by writing the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), One North Capitol Street,
Suite 001, Indianapolis, IN 46204 or by calling (888) 526-1687.
Retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Normal retirement is defined as the earliest
of: (1) age 65 with 10 years of creditable service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of creditable service;
or (3) the sum of age and creditable service equal to 85, but not earlier than age 55. A reduced
benefit will be received if an employee takes early retirement between the ages of 50 and 65
and has had 15 or more years of creditable service. Employees may elect to either receive a
lump-sum distribution of their annuity savings account balance upon retirement or receive an
annuity amount as a monthly supplement to the retirement benefits described above. PERF

also provides death and disability benefits. These benefit provisions and all other requirements
are established by state statute and ordinance.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies
Consent Decree:
The Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system does not comply with federal Clean
Water regulations. After several years of negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the EPA
lodged a Consent Decree with the federal court on December 28, 2007. The Consent Decree
became effective April 1, 2008. Under the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree, the
Utilities committed to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) days in a typical
year to one day on the St. Joseph River and four days on the St. Mary’s and Maumee Rivers.
The infrastructure cost to reduce the number of CSO events is approximately $240 million, to
be spent over the next 18 years, concluding in 2025. The Utilities also agreed to eliminate
three known sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated combined cost of $31 million by specific
dates noted in the Consent Decree. Additionally, the Utilities committed to maintain the entire
sewer system to performance standards prescribed in the Utilities’ Long-Term Control Plan
incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree. The Consent Decree further provides for
stipulated penalties for failure to achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines
or maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with the Consent Decree’s terms
and conditions.
Condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets:
In June, 2002, the Utilities initiated condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets. On
February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16,910,500 and took possession of those
condemned assets. The acquisition was financed by Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond
Anticipation Notes, Series 2007 (BAN) issued February 5, 2008 for $17,840,000, including the
purchase price and estimated issuance and integration costs. The BAN was subsequently
refinanced four times (see Note 9). The North Assets are now fully integrated with the Utilities’
water and sewer systems and generating revenues for the respective Utilities at standard
system-wide tariffs.
The purchase price was established through condemnation proceedings by Fort Wayne Board
of Public Works and is currently being contested by Aqua Indiana in Wells County Circuit
Court. At this time, the Utilities are unable to form a conclusion as to whether the assertion of
further action by Aqua Indiana is either probable or remote, nor as to the amount of damages if
assessed, nor to the possible costs of the corrective action, if any.

(17) Subsequent Events
Water Utility Rates:
On May 14, 2013, the Common Council of Fort Wayne approved a change in water rates to
be effective January 1, 2014. The new rates were developed based on a cost of service
study and are not intended to generate additional revenue but rather more accurately charge
the appropriate class of customer for water services. Most significantly, the City of Fort
Wayne will no longer pay for public fire protection services and, instead, all water customers
will pay for public fire protection based on the size of their water meter. Indiana Utility
Regulatory Commission must also approve the rates before the rates can become effective.
Bond Issuances:
On March 13, 2013, the Wastewater Utility issued revenue bonds for $32,955,000. The
average interest rate is 1.95%. It matures serially in amounts ranging from $600,000 in 2013 to
$4,060,000 in 2024.
On March 13, 2013, the Wastewater Utility issued revenue bonds for $42,260,000. The
average interest rate is 3.54%. It matures serially in amount ranging from $4,165,000 in 2025
to $5,295,000 in 2033.
40

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2012 and 2011

On March 13, 2013, the Wastewater Utility issued $7,335,000 in refunding revenue bonds with
an average interest rate of 1.00% to advance refund $7,985,000 of outstanding 2002C series
bonds with interest rates ranging from 1.30% to 4.55% and 2003 series bonds with interest
rates ranging from 2.00% to 3.80%. The 2013 refunding bonds mature serially in amounts
ranging from $500,000 in 2013 to $1,390,000 in 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
As management of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), we offer readers of
the Utilities’ financial statements, this narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the Utilities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008
and 2007. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in
conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in the basic
financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements.
Financial Highlights
•

The assets of the Utilities exceeded its liabilities as of December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 by $448.9 million, $442.8 million and $421.1 million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ net assets increased for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 by $6.1 million, $21.7 million and $16.0 million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ added new bonded debt and long-term notes payable for
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 of $23.3 million, $38.2
million and $68.4 million, respectively. The 2008 increase in debt consists
of a short term Water bond anticipation note and additional withdrawals
against existing SRF loans.

•

The Utilities’ investment in capital assets for the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 increased approximately $76.7 million, $47.3
million and $53.5 million, respectively. Significantly, in 2008:
o Invested an additional $5.1 million in the Primaries - phase II of a
comprehensive improvement to our wastewater treatment plant.
The Primaries’ investment has used $37.1 million of the total $40
million SRF commitment. The Primaries was fully operational in
October 2008.
o Reliability was enhanced through the construction of $14.1 million
in pump redundancy, electrical system upgrade and emergency
back-up equipment.
o Acquired the North system assets of Aqua Indiana for $16.9 million
and invested nearly $0.7 million to connect the North system to
Utilities system.

3

o Over $4.3 million was invested in water and sewer main
replacement and/or rehabilitation.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the Utilities’ basic financial
statements. The Utilities are governmental entities classified as enterprise funds,
subsets of proprietary funds. When an entity charges a fee to cover the entire
cost of its operation, these services are classified as a proprietary fund. And
more specifically, when an entity is self-supported completely by providing
services to outside customers, it is an enterprise fund. An enterprise fund’s
financial statements are comprised of three statements and the accompanying
notes to these statements. The three statements are: 1) statement of net assets,
2) statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net assets and 3) statement
of cash flows. The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full
understanding of the data provided in the Utilities’ financial statements. The
notes can be found on pages 16-39 of this report.
The Utilities provide water, wastewater, stormwater, electric, and yard waste
services. The Utilities’ financial statements have been prepared to reflect the
activity of each of these services. The Electric Utility generation and distribution
systems were leased to a private firm in 1975. Portions of the lease payments
are directed by Common Council ordinance into the Community Trust.

Financial Analysis
As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
governmental unit’s financial health. In the case of the Utilities, assets exceeded
liabilities by $448.9 million, $ 442.8 million and $421.1 million as of December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The largest portion (89.0%) of the Utilities’
net assets in 2008 reflects its investment in capital assets (land, buildings,
machinery, equipment and distribution and collection infrastructure), less any
related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.

5

Another significant portion of the Utilities’ net assets ($43.1 million, or 10.0%)
represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be
used.
The Utilities net assets increased $6.1 million, $21.7 million and $16.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net asset
growth in 2008 was less than 2007 by $15.6 million as follows:
•

•
•

Operating income in 2008 was $3.4 million less than 2007. Rates
did not increase in 2008 and revenues remained basically flat.
Overall revenues increased $1.1 million or 1.4%. Expenses
increased 8.4%.
Depreciation (driven by heavy recent
infrastructure investments) and increases in administrative services
pushed expenses higher than normal inflationary trends.
Capital contributions in 2008 were $1.7 million more than 2007.
Capital contributions are principally the value of infrastructure
donated to the Utilities by local area developers.
Investment income decreased significantly in 2008 from 2007 by
$14.7 million. Community Trust funds invested in marketable
securities lost 27% of its value or $9.6 million. Interest income
decreased in 2008 over 2007 by $1.9 million as investible cash
decreased and interest rates stayed low in 2008. Interest expense
decreased nearly $0.6 million between 2008 and 2007 as increased
construction activity caused an increase in capitalized interest.

Capital Assets and Capital Improvement Program
The Utilities total capital assets in service are $757.1 million with an accumulated
depreciation of $240.7 million for a net book value of $516.4 million. The
statement of net assets also includes $55.6 million in construction in progress
reflecting capital projects in various stages of completion. To continue to deliver
high quality services and comply with EPA and other regulatory agencies, the
Utilities need to invest in new capital and capital improvement programs. As
noted in 2006, the Utilities achieved an important milestone in its completion of
the replacement of the preliminary wastewater treatment facility (the Headworks;
$23 million investment). This year, the Utilities completed phase II; a $32 million
Primaries project and that phase was operational in October 2008. The Utilities
also made important investments in many other projects, particularly those that
reduce the number of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO’s) and the volume of
discharges directly to the rivers as well as main replacement/rehab. And, the
Utilities acquired the North assets of Aqua Indiana for $16.9 million. During
2008, approximately $71.4 million was spent on capital investments.
The Utilities regularly conduct long-range studies to evaluate service quality and
capability. Additional significant investments in capital are anticipated to
continue: to replace the preliminary treatment facilities and upgrade the

6

secondary facilities at the Water Pollution Control Plant, to implement projects to
reduce the number of CSO’s and the volume of discharges directly to the rivers,
to improve Combined Sewer Capacity to reduce the risk of basement backups, to
replace six miles of water mains per year, to increase finished water storage
capacity and to insure uninterrupted service of finished water through fail-safe
security, strategic redundancy and the development of emergency electrical
back-up systems for key pump stations and the treatment plants.
Debt
At December 31, 2008, the Utilities had approximately $176.0 million in bonds
and loans payable, a decrease of $6.8 million over last year. The Wastewater
Utility increased its draw against a $40.0 million maximum financial assistance
agreement with the State of Indiana’s Wastewater Revolving Loan Program
(2005 SRF) by $5.4 million, for a total withdrawal-to-date of $39.3 million. The
total proceeds withdrawn from the 2005 SRF are classified as long-term loan
payable and, after principal payments, totaled $30.9 million as of December 31,
2008. The Utilities paid down total debt by $12.3 million.
A Bond Anticipation Note (BAN) was issued by the Water Utility for $17.8 million
in Feb 2008 to provide funds to acquire the north assets of Aqua Indiana.
Economic Factors and Next Years Budget and Rates
•

On December 28, 2007, the Utilities tentatively agreed to a Long-Term
Control Plan (LTCP), in the form of a federal Consent Decree, which will
ultimately bring the Utilities’ storm and sanitary sewer system into compliance
with the federal Clean Water Act. The Consent Decree became effective
April 1, 2008. The Utilities committed to combined sewer overflow reductions
that require an approximate investment of $240.0 million in infrastructure
solutions over the next 18 years. The Utilities also agreed to:
o Eliminate three sanitary sewer overflows by 2014 at an estimated cost
of $31.0 million.
o Maintain the entire storm and sewer systems to performance
standards prescribed in the LTCP.
o Pay assessed penalties of $0.8 million in cash and local investments.
The Consent Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to
achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines or
maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with terms and
conditions of the Consent Decree.

•

Prior to the official filing of the Consent Decree on December 28, 2007, the
Utilities invested in plant solutions that will increase the wastewater plant’s
capacity from the current 60 million gallons per day (mgd) to 85 mgd and will
be instrumental in the battle to reduce combined sewer overflows. Over the

7

four years ended in 2005, proceeds from the 2002 SRF loan were used to
construct the new Headworks, the first improvement project to upgrade the
wastewater treatment plant. The Headworks project replaces and expands
the capacity of the 1940’s raw wastewater pump station and grit removal
facilities. The Headworks successfully went into production in early 2005. In
October of 2005, the SRF approved funding for the design and construction of
the Primaries, the next improvement project to upgrade the wastewater
treatment plant. This phase was completed in October 2008 and rebuilt the
primary settling tanks (1940’s and 1960’s construction) at a cost of $37.5
million. Additional investments of nearly $10 million over the next 5 years are
needed to allow the plant to deliver the full 85 mgd.
•

The Utilities will continue to pursue the goal to design and construct six miles
of water main replacement and five miles of sewer rehabilitation work.

•

The Utilities have entered into several local land developer financed water
and wastewater main projects over the last five years ended 2007. The
developers construct new wastewater and water capacity in newly developing
service areas. The collection systems are turned over to the Utilities in
exchange for future area sourced connections fees and surcharges (see note
9).

•

As noted above, the Utilities have significantly increased their long-term debt
to accomplish important and necessary improvements to their plants and its
distribution, drainage and collection systems. Debt-to-asset ratios measure
financial leverage and the Utilities believe that a ratio over 50% is excess risk.
The Utilities’ ratios are well below that threshold.

Prior to 2006, the Utilities had not had a rate increase since July 2001.
Effective September 1, 2006, the Water Utility generally increased its rates
25%. The Sewer Utility generally increased its rates 25% effective March 1,
2007. These rate increases will pay for increased debt service, inflationary
increases in expenses, new regulatory compliance costs and additional
infrastructure investments. A sewer rate increase is planned for 2009 but the
effective date and amount is still unknown.

•

In June 2002, the Utilities initiated a condemnation action of Aqua Indiana’s
North Assets. On February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16.9

8

million and took possession of those condemned assets. The North Assets
are now fully integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer system and
generating revenues at existing rates from 8,600 new retail water customers
and 1,600 new retail sewer customers. Aqua Indiana asserts that the
purchase price is inadequate and has sued for unspecified damages. The
purchase price was financed by a 12 month Bond Anticipation Note (BAN),
which was subsequently refinanced by another 12 month BAN. The Utilities
intend to obtain permanent financing if and when the price is either adjusted
or confirmed by the courts.
•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Wastewater Utility acquired the wastewater
assets of the Town of Zanesville. Prior to that date, Zanesville had been a
wholesale customer of the Wastewater Utility.
Assets valued at
approximately $1 million were funded by a Junior Revenue Bond for $0.9
million and cash.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2008 and 2007

(1) Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Entity
The City of Fort Wayne Utilities (the Utilities) are included in the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana
reporting entity pursuant to the entity definition criteria contained in the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 14.
The Utilities consist of Water, Wastewater, Stormwater, and Electric utilities in addition to the
Yard Waste facility. All five areas are considered proprietary in nature. The electric utility
generation and distribution systems were leased to a private firm in 1975.
Basis of Accounting and Financial Reporting
The Utilities prepare their financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as
applied to governmental units. The Utilities elected, under GASB Statement 20, not to apply
statements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) after November 30,
1989.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses and other changes in net assets during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the combined statement of cash flows, the Utilities consider all highly liquid
investments (including restricted assets) with maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments are stated at fair value, except for short-term (less than one year), highly liquid
investments (i.e. Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, etc.), which are reported at
cost or amortized cost.
Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by bond indentures and other legal requirements for
debt retirement, capital improvements and refunds of customer deposits.

16

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2008 and 2007

Then both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
primary government’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as
they are needed.
Capital Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes interest incurred during
construction periods. Donated property, plant and equipment are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of donation. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not
add to the value of the asset or materially extend the assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
When an individual asset is retired, depreciation is calculated. The difference between the
original cost and the calculated depreciation results in a recognized gain or loss.
Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Yard Waste Utilities’ assets are depreciated by
individual asset. Electric Utility assets not under lease are depreciated using the group
method. Depreciation of leased Electric Utility assets is calculated annually by dividing net
assets by the years remaining on the 35-year lease.
Estimated useful lives, in years, are as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Equipment and other
Distribution and collection

Bond Issuance Costs, Discounts and Premiums

Bond issuance costs, discounts and premiums are amortized over the lives of the respective
bond issues using the interest method.
Compensated Absences
Employees earn vacation at rates from ten days to twenty-five days per year, based on the
number of years of service. One year of unused vacation leave may be carried over to the
next. Unpaid vacation pay is recorded as a liability as the benefits accrue to the employee.
Accrued compensated absences for Utilities’ personnel are charged as an operating
expense, using the vesting method, based on earned but unused vacation and sick leave
days including the Utilities’ share of social security and medicare taxes.
Unused sick leave may be carried over from year to year. City employees must have
completed ten years of service to receive payment for unused sick leave. Unused sick leave
payoffs are calculated as follows: (1) $1.00 for each hour up to 520 hours, plus (2) 50% of the
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate times each sick leave hour over 520. In lieu of
item “2” above, the employee may receive credit at the rate of 100% of the employee’s
normal straight time hourly rate for each sick leave hour over 520 if used to purchase group
health insurance; with any remaining hours paid to the employee at the rate of 50% of
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate. There is a $25,000 limit on the amount paid for
sick time accrual. Council approved exceptions to this limit in 2000. The liability recorded for
unused sick leave is an estimate based on prior experience of the actual payoff method
chosen.
Classification of Revenue
The Utilities have classified their revenue as either operating or nonoperating according to
the following criteria:
-

Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange
transactions, such as customer charges and lease payments.

-

Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange
transactions, such as contributions and other revenue sources that are defined as
nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and
Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Government Entities That Use Proprietary Fund
Accounting, and GASB Statement 34, such as investment income.

Investment Policies

Indiana Code 5-13-9 authorizes the Utilities to invest in securities backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Treasury or fully guaranteed by the United States and issued by
the United States Treasury, a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. Indiana Code also authorizes the Utilities to invest in
securities fully guaranteed and issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality or a
federal government sponsored enterprise. These investments are required by statute to
have a stated final maturity of not more than 2 years. Indiana Code also provides for
19

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2008 and 2007

investment in money market mutual funds that are in the form of securities of or interest in an
open-end, no-load, management-type investment company or investment trust registered
under the provision of the Federal Investment Company act of 1940, as amended.
Investments in money market mutual funds may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the funds
held by the Utilities and available for investment. The portfolio of an investment company or
investment trust used must be limited to direct obligations of the United States, obligations
issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, a federal government sponsored
enterprise; or repurchase agreements fully collateralized by direct obligations of the United
States or obligations issued by a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a federal
government sponsored enterprise. The form of securities of or interest in an investment
company or investment trust must be rated as AAA, or its equivalent by Standard and Poor’s
Corporation or its successor or Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
its successor. The form of securities in an investment company or investment trust should
have a stated final maturity of one (1) day.
The Community Trust, which invests in a variety of securities and mutual funds, is not subject
to the requirements of Indiana Statutes governing authorized investments.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of
an investment. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy that limits investment
maturities as a means of managing their exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing
interest rates.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its
obligations. The Utilities do not have a formal investment policy for credit risk. The
distribution of securities with credit ratings is summarized below.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government’s
investment in a single issuer. The Utilities do not have a policy in regards to concentration of
credit risk. U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities are exempt from this
policy requirement.
Custodial Credit Risk
For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the
counterparty, the Utilities will not be able to recover the value of their investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The Utilities do not have a policy in
regard to custodial credit risk.
Foreign Currency Risk
This risk relates to adverse affects on the fair value of an investment from changes in
exchange rates. The Utilities’ exposure to foreign currency risk derives from their investment
at December 31, 2008 in a foreign bond mutual fund with a fair value of $1,834,674 and at
December 31, 2007 in a foreign bond mutual fund with a fair value of $2,409,701. The
Utilities do not have a policy in regard to foreign currency risk.
Other
Under the City’s cash management program, the Utilities participate in pooled cash account
arrangements for some of their cash and investment activities. Interfund borrowing is shown
as interfund receivables/payables in the accompanying financial statements. Interest income
is allocated to accounts with positive balances.
For the year ending December 31, 2008, the assets of the Community Trust declined in
market value by $9,761,312. The Trust incurred realized losses of $134,015, unrealized loss
of $11,385,207 and cash net income of $1,757,910. For the year ending December 31,
2007, the assets of the Community Trust increased in market value by $3,013,392. The
Trust incurred realized gain of $389,039, unrealized gain of $586,098 and cash net income of
$2,038,255.

Sinking Fund Accounts
The Sewage Works Junior Revenue Bonds of 1998, A and B Series require monthly deposits
into a sinking fund account of net revenues of the Wastewater Utility in an amount equal to at
least 1/12 of the following calendar year’s principal and interest payments. In addition, a 10%
surplus of monthly deposits is required. An amount equal to the maximum annual principal
and interest requirements is also required to be paid into this account, nominally titled the
Sewage Works Reserve Account.
The Sewage Works Junior Revenue Refunding Bonds of 2002 A, B, C, 2003, 2005 and 2007
Series require monthly deposits into a sinking fund account of Wastewater Utility net
revenues in an amount equal to at least 1/12 of the following calendar year’s principal and
interest payments. In addition, a 10% surplus of monthly deposits is required. Surety bonds
purchased by the Utilities cover the Sewer Works Reserve Account requirements.
Monthly deposits into sinking fund accounts of both the Water and Stormwater Utilities’ net
revenues are required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual
interest payments and 1/12 of the next annual principal payments. Upon meeting certain
minimum balance requirements, transfers may be made to unrestricted cash accounts.
Surety bonds purchased by the Utilities cover the Waterworks and Stormwater Reserve
Accounts requirements.
Construction Account
Unspent bond issue proceeds to be used in the construction of designated capital assets are
included in this account.
Replacement Account
This account, required by the Environmental Protection Agency, exists to provide resources
to maintain the capacity and performance of the property of the Wastewater Utility. In 1991,
the Indiana Department of Environmental Management concluded that the account was
underfunded. The Wastewater Utility agreed to fund the account over the remaining life of
the equipment acquired under the grant. It was anticipated the desired balance of
$6,880,000 would be fully funded by December 31, 1997. However, the City Council capped
the account at $6,657,609 as of June 10, 1997. The Wastewater Utility spent $481,000 and
$1,106,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, from this Replacement Account. The account
will be replenished from future operating revenues on a annual straight-line basis over the
useful life of the assets acquired. The account was replenished in the amount of $204,000
and $20,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Depreciation Account
The Water Utility is required to maintain a Depreciation Account in an amount not less than
$1,000,000. However, in the event moneys are withdrawn from the Depreciation Account
leaving a balance of less than $1,000,000, the deficiency shall be restored within eighteen
months. On December 31, 2007, the Water Utility’s Operating Fund borrowed $1,000,000
from the Depreciation Account, leaving no monies in the Depreciation Account. The Water
Utility restored the Depreciation Account back to its $1,000,000 minimum on June 30, 2008.
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits are refundable amounts received from Water Utility customers to insure
against nonpayment of billings or water main damages.
Connection Fees
Resources from specific area connection fees to be used for future development costs in
those specific areas are accumulated in this account.
Tank Painting
Resources for elevated tank painting maintenance are accumulated in this account.
(4) Assessments Receivable
Assessments receivable represent assessments due from customers for sewer connections.
A significant portion of the individual assessments range from $2,000 to $2,500 and are due
in 120 monthly principal installments plus interest on the unpaid portion at 7% per year.
(5) Community Trust
The City Council established the Community Trust in 1975 to account for a portion of the
proceeds received from a private utility leasing the assets of the Electric Utility (see Note 6).
The Community Trust receives $270,000 annually from rents in addition to income earned on
the investment of the funds. The funds are meant to enable the City to reclaim its Electric
Utility by reimbursing the private utility for additions and extensions upon default of its
obligations under the lease or upon termination of the lease.
Under the provisions of the ordinance, the corpus of the trust is to be free from invasion as
long as the lease is in force. However, as long as certain provisions are met, including
approval by the citizens of Fort Wayne, the City Council has the ability to amend this
ordinance and permit invasion of the trust corpus.

(6) Lease of Electric Utility
The Electric Utility has leased its entire utility system, including power plant, substations, and
transmissions and distribution system, to a private electric utility serving the surrounding
area. The lease term commenced March 1, 1975, and expires 35 years later in February
2010. There is a 15-year renewal option at that time. Lease payments of $1,740,000 and
$1,740,000 were received for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Under the terms of the agreement, the lessee may make improvements and retire assets in
the system as long as such improvements and retirements do not exceed 5% of the original
cost of the leased property in any one given year. The City of Fort Wayne Common Council
must approve amounts in excess of 5% in any year. Depreciation expense for the leased
assets was $187,331 and $187,237 for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Upon termination of the
lease, the Electric Utility has the first option to purchase those improvements at a cost of
approximately net book value.

(7) Change in Accounting Estimate
Effective January 1, 2007, the Utilities changed their method of depreciation from a group
method to an individual asset straight-line method. The group method, while simpler to
maintain, did not properly account for newly purchased assets nested in aging asset pools
nor did it properly account for the partial retirement of aging infrastructure. The cumulative
effect of the change in method of depreciation as of January 1, 2007 is as follows:

State of Indiana’s Wastewater Revolving Loan program that allows for a maximum of
$40,000,000 and $23,500,000 in 2005 and 2002, respectively, for improvements at the
Wastewater treatment facility. At December 31, 2008, $39,374,743 and $23,454,351 had
been drawn against the 2005 and 2002 agreements, respectively, with a principal balance of
$34,814,743 and $19,179,351, respectively. At December 31, 2007, $33,926,779 and

Indiana’s State Revolving Fund Pooled Loan program. This program allows Indiana
municipalities to collectively borrow funds under the AAA rating of the State of Indiana’s
creditworthiness as well as receive other financial benefits. Under this program the Utilities
received $31,900,000 to invest in improvements to the Water Utility’s infrastructure. The
interest rate is 3.95% and the principal matures serially in amounts ranging from $1,730,000
in 2009 to $2,755,000 in 2021. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the outstanding principal

to be used as a loan to Allen County to cover a portion of the costs of construction of a minor
league baseball stadium. The City repaid the loan at the interest rate of 4.55% per year in
equal annual installments through July 2007. The loan was paid in full in 2007. In 2002, The
Community Trust Fiduciary Fund was closed and activity was transferred to the Electric Fund.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2008 and 2007

(14) Equity Transfers
The 10-year sewer capacity improvement program includes storm sewer construction funded
through the Wastewater Utility or Stormwater Utility. New storm sewers allow old combined
sewers to be converted to sanitary-only lines. As projects are completed, the new storm
sewers are transferred from the Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility and new sanitary
sewers are transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility. The amount transferred
from Wastewater Utility to Stormwater Utility was $2,158,482 and $51,415 in 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The amount transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility was
$329,319 and $1,263,209 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
(15) Risk Management
The City, including the Utilities, retains the risk of loss for claims related to employee health,
on-the-job injury, auto, and general liabilities, while continuing to buy premium insurance for
a number of other risks. The City has established internal service funds to finance these
risks. Interfund premiums are billed monthly on a cost allocation basis most appropriate to
the type of risk involved. An excess policy covers individual health insurance claims in
excess of $150,000 per year and the insurance company assumes the risk when total
monthly claims exceed an amount based upon an aggregate monthly factor. An excess
policy for workers compensation covers individual claims in excess of $150,000 per
employee per injury. The general and auto liability is limited by Indiana government tort
liability limits of $500,000 per person and incident. Liabilities are the responsibility of the
City’s internal service funds.
(16) Pension Plans
A. Public Employees’ Retirement Fund
Plan Description
The Utilities contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund (PERF), a defined-benefit
pension plan. PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system, which
provides retirement benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. All full-time employees are
eligible to participate in the defined-benefit plan.
State statutes (IC 5-10.2 and 5-10.3) govern most requirements of the system and give the
Utilities authority to contribute to the plan. PERF retirement benefits consist of employer
provided contributions plus an annuity provided by the member’s annuity savings account. The
annuity savings account consists of member’s contributions, set by statute at three percent of
compensation, plus the interest credited to the member’s account. The employer may elect to
make the contributions on behalf of the member.

34

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2008 and 2007

PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and
required supplementary information for the plan as a whole and for its participants. That report
may be obtained by writing the Indiana Public Employees’ Retirement Fund, Harrison Building,
Room 800, 143 West Market Street, Indianapolis, IN 46204 or by calling (317) 233-4162.
Retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Normal retirement is defined as the earliest
of: (1) age 65 with 10 years of creditable service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of creditable service;
or (3) the sum of age and creditable service equal to 85, but not earlier than age 55. A reduced
benefit will be received if an employee takes early retirement between the ages of 50 and 65
and has had 15 or more years of creditable service. Employees may elect to either receive a
lump-sum distribution of their annuity savings account balance upon retirement or receive an
annuity amount as a monthly supplement to the retirement benefits described above. PERF
also provides death and disability benefits. These benefit provisions and all other requirements
are established by state statute and ordinance.
Funding Policy and Annual Pension Cost
The PERF Board of Trustees establishes contribution requirements for plan members. The
Utilities’ annual pension cost for years ended 2008 and 2007, and related information as
provided by the actuary, is presented in this note.

B. Municipal Pension Plan
The Utilities also have a defined benefit pension plan (funded on a pay-as-you-go basis)
covering employees who started receiving retirement or disability benefits before July 1976.
For each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Utilities paid annual benefits
of $5,145 to four former employees or survivors. The accrued pension cost for this plan is
$24,397 and $25,629 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
(17) Commitments and Contingencies
Consent Decree:
The Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system does not comply with federal Clean
Water regulations. After several years of negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the EPA
lodged a Consent Decree with the federal court on December 28, 2007. The Consent Decree
became effective April 1, 2008. Under the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree, the
Utilities committed to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) days in a typical
year to one day on the St. Joseph River and four days on the St. Mary’s and Maumee Rivers.
The infrastructure cost to reduce the number of CSO events is approximately $240 million, to
be spent over the next 18 years, concluding in 2025. The Utilities also agreed to eliminate
three known sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated combined cost of $31 million by specific
dates noted in the Consent Decree. Additionally, the Utilities committed to maintain the entire
sewer system to performance standards prescribed in the Utilities’ Long-Term Control Plan
incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree.
The EPA assessed penalties of $842,109 for violations of the Clean Water Act committed prior
to December 28, 2007. In lieu of cash payment, the Utilities committed to spend $540,000 on
specific environmentally beneficial projects over the next seven years. A cash penalty payment
of $297,636 including accrued interest of $1,527 was made April 30, 2008. The Consent
Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to achieve specified construction
milestones, reporting deadlines or maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance
with the Consent Decree’s terms and conditions.
Condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets:
In June, 2002, the Utilities initiated condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets. On
February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16,910,500 and took possession of those
condemned assets. The acquisition was financed by Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond
Anticipation Notes, Series 2007 (BAN) issued February 5, 2008 for $17,840,000, including the
purchase price and estimated issuance and integration costs. The BAN has an interest rate of
1.81% and is payable on or before February 11, 2009. The North Assets are now fully
integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer systems and generating revenues for the
respective Utilities at existing rates.

December 31, 2008 and 2007

The purchase price was established through condemnation proceedings by Fort Wayne
Board of Public Works and is currently being contested by Aqua Indiana in Wells County Circuit
Court. At this time, the Utilities are unable to form a conclusion as to whether the assertion of
action by Aqua Indiana is either probable or remote, nor as to the amount of damages if
assessed, nor to the possible costs of the corrective action, if any.
Light Lease Revenues:
By ordinance, light lease revenues (see note 6) in excess of operating expenses and the
contribution to the Community Trust (see note 5) are required to be transferred to the City’s
Cumulative Capital Fund. As of December 31, the Electric Utility maintained operating cash
balances of $214,522 and $262,711 for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such amounts are
withheld from the City to cover near term operating expenses and, if unspent, will be summarily
remitted to the City.

(18) Subsequent Events
Bank Anticipation Notes – Refinanced:
The Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 2008 (BAN1) (see note 10)
was retired from the proceeds of the Waterworks Utility Revenue Bond Anticipation Notes,
Series 2009 (BAN2). BAN2 was issued on February 11, 2009 in the amount of $17,840,000.
BAN2 has an interest rate of 4.25% and the principle and interest is payable on February 11,
2010.
Zanesville Acquisition:
On January 1, 2009, the Wastewater Utility (Utility) purchased the wastewater assets of the
Town of Zanesville (Zanesville). Prior to the acquisition, Zanesville was a wholesale customer
of the Utility. The Utility paid $1,000,099 (approximate fair market value) for the asset,
financing $906,000 through the Junior Sewage Works Revenue Bonds, Series 2008, (Junior
Bonds) assuming $91,401 debt service reserve fund and the rest in cash. The Utility also
agreed to spend up to $750,000 in system improvements over the next five years. Zanesville
residents will be charged a special surcharge over the next ten years, sufficient enough to
recover the purchase price and no more than $750,000 in system improvements. The Junior
Bonds have a 2% interest rate and mature serially in amounts ranging from $53,000 in 2009 to
$120,000 in 2016.
Rate Increase/Bond Issuance:
On May 26, 2009, the City Council of Fort Wayne authorized the Utility to increase their billing
rates for the Wastewater Utility. The Council approved a five year rate proposal increasing
generally retail wastewater rates by 22.5%, 15%, 11%, 9% and 9%, starting July 1, 2009 and
then each subsequent July 1st until 2013, respectively. On June 2, 2009, Council authorized
the issuance of bonds totaling up to $265.0 million. The five year rate proposal anticipates
bonding in three installments of $71.4 million, $96.5 million and $87.0 million in 2009, 2011
and 2013, respectively. The amount and timing of each bond issue will change based on
actual events leading up to issue dates, such as; construction schedules, updated
construction cost estimates and suitable financial markets.

Community Trust Investment Performance:
For the quarter ending March 31, 2009 (the most recent market valuation available), the assets
of the Community Trust declined in market value by $1,258,122. The Trust incurred realized
losses of $1,548,150, unrealized gains of $150,854 and cash net income of $139,174.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

TO: THE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES, ALLEN COUNTY, INDIANA

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and each
major fund of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), departments of the City of Fort Wayne, as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2013, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively
comprise the Utilities' basic financial statements, as listed in the Table of Contents.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Utilities' internal
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statement.
We believe that our audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
(Continued)

Opinions
In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the business-type activities and each major fund of the Utilities as of December
31, 2013, and the respective changes in financial position and cash flows, where applicable, thereof and for
the year then ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of the Utilities are intended to present the financial
position, the changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows of only that portion of the
business-type activities of the City that is attributable to the transactions of the Utilities. They do not purport
to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the City of Fort Wayne, as of December 31, 2013, the
changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with
respect to this matter.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the
Management's Discussion and Analysis, as listed in the Table of Contents, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context.
We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with
management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained
during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on
the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an
opinion or provide any assurance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
As management of the City of Fort Wayne Utilities (Utilities), we offer readers of
the Utilities’ financial statements, this narrative overview and analysis of the
financial activities of the Utilities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.
We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction
with additional information that we have furnished in the basic financial
statements and the notes to the basic financial statements.
Financial Highlights
•

The assets and deferred outflow of resources of the Utilities exceeded its
liabilities (net position) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 by $508.5
million and $481.6 million, respectively.

•

The Utilities’ net position increased (decreased) for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 by $26.9 million and ($43.7) million,
respectively.

•

The Utilities’ added new bonded debt and long-term loans payable for
years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 of $101.3 million and $100.0
million, respectively. The 2013 increase in debt consists of two new
Wastewater Revenue Bonds and additional withdrawals against existing
SRF loans.
The Utilities were able to take advantage of the recent low interest rate
financial markets and acquire new long term debt in 2013 at rates ranging
from 1.95% to 3.50%. Additionally, refunding bonds issued in early 2013
at rate averaging of 1.00% were issued to retire bonds with interest rates
ranging from 1.30% to 4.55%.

•

The Utilities’ net investment in capital assets for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 increased approximately $7.0 million and
$11.5 million. Significantly, the Utilities continue to meet all 2009-2013
capital investment milestones required by the 2008 Federal Consent
Decree.

Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the Utilities’ basic financial
statements. The Utilities are governmental entities classified as enterprise funds,
subsets of proprietary funds. When an entity charges a fee to cover the entire
cost of its operation, these services are classified as a proprietary fund. And
more specifically, when an entity is self-supported completely by providing
3

services to outside customers, it is an enterprise fund. An enterprise fund’s
financial statements are comprised of three statements and the accompanying
notes to these statements. The three statements are: 1) statement of net
position, 2) statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position and 3)
statement of cash flows. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the Utilities’ financial
statements. The notes can be found on pages 13-35 of this report.
The Utilities provide water, wastewater, stormwater, and yard waste services.
The Utilities’ financial statements have been prepared to reflect the activity of
each of these services. The Electric Utility’s generation and distribution systems
(operating system) were leased to a private firm in 1975 and the entire operating
system was purchased by that private firm in 2011. Since 1975 portions of the
lease payments were accumulated in a Community Trust Fund and that Trust
Fund coupled with the assets generated from the sale of the Electric Utility’s
operating assets were transferred to the City Community Legacy Fund in 2012.

Financial Analysis
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
governmental unit’s financial health. In the case of the Utilities, assets and
deferred outflow of resources exceeded liabilities by $508.5 million and $481.6
million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The largest portion
(84.8%) of the Utilities’ net position in 2013 reflects its net investment in capital
assets (land, buildings, machinery, equipment and distribution and collection
infrastructure), less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still
outstanding.
Another significant portion of the Utilities’ net position ($42.8 million, or 8.4%)
represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be
used.
The Utilities net position increased/(decreased) $26.9 million and ($43.7) million
for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

5

Capital Assets and Capital Improvement Program
The Utilities total capital assets in service are $1.057 billion with an accumulated
depreciation of $301.2 million for a net book value of $756.2 million. The
statement of net position also includes $46.8 million in construction in progress
reflecting capital projects in various stages of completion. During 2013,
approximately $74.9 million was invested in capital projects (see Note 5).
Debt
At December 31, 2013, the Utilities had approximately $420.2 million in bonds
and loans payable, an increase of $76.2 million over last year.
The Utilities closed on two new long-term bond/loan issues in 2013. The bonds’
proceeds were used to fund significant capital expenditures. The new bond/loan
issues in 2013 were:
-

An open market wastewater revenue bond for $33.0 million over 12
years at 1.95%.
An open market wastewater revenue bond for $42.3 million over 21
years at 3.50%.

In December 2013, the Utilities issued $7.3 million in wastewater refunding
revenue bonds payable over 6 years at 1.00% to advance refund $8.0 million in
2002C and 2003 Wastewater bonds and loans. In doing this, the Utility in effect
lowered its aggregate debt service payment by $0.5 million and realized an
economic gain of $0.5 million (see Note 7).
The Utilities paid principal (including the refunding transactions) of $25.3 million
and $55.1 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budget and Rates
•

On December 28, 2007, the Utilities agreed to a Long-Term Control Plan
(LTCP), in the form of a federal Consent Decree, which will ultimately bring
the Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system into compliance with
the federal Clean Water Act. The Consent Decree became effective April 1,
2008. The Utilities committed to combined sewer overflow reductions that
require an approximate investment of $240.0 million (denominated in 2005
dollars) in infrastructure solutions over the next 18 years. The Utilities also
agreed to:
o Eliminate three sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated cost of $31.0
million.
o Maintain the entire storm and sewer systems to performance
standards prescribed in the LTCP.
6

o Mitigate assessed penalties with local investments in septic tank
elimination subsidies and rain garden stipends.
The Consent Decree further provides for stipulated penalties for failure to
achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines or
maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with terms and
conditions of the Consent Decree.
Consistent with the long term nature of the Consent Decree, Fort Wayne City
Council (Council) approved a five year rate proposal that generally increased
wastewater unit rates by approximately 25% effective July 1, 2009 and again
on July 1, 2010-2013 of each year by 15%, 11%, 9% and 9%, respectively.
At that same time, Council authorized the issuance of up to $265 million in
debt to fund a six year capital plan that will accomplish a significant portion of
the infrastructure investment required to fulfill the requirements of the
Consent Decree. As of December 31, 2013, the Utilities have issued $248.0
million debt associated with the $265 million that Council authorized.
The Utilities are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Consent Decree. Significantly, the Utilities completed: the upgrade to the
wastewater plant primaries and completed 15 combined sewer separation
projects. The Utilities also constructed a backflow process that fully treats
nearly 1 billion gallons of wastewater per year that previously entered the
Maumee River only partially treated. And untreated wastewater storage
capacity was increased by nearly 100 million gallons through several pond
enhancement projects. Additionally, the pump station utilized to fill those
ponds has had its capacity increased to maximize the available storage.
The wastewater treatment plant upgrade ultimately will treat up to 85 million
gallons per day (mgd), up from 60 mgd. In early 2012, the plant achieved its
interim milestone and operates at 70 mgd Construction to upgrade to the
targeted 85 mgd has begun with completion by the end of 2015.
Lining wastewater pipelines significantly extends the life of the pipeline,
improves overall system flow and reduces reactive maintenance. Since 2008,
the Utilities have invested $22.1 million to line approximately 85.5 miles of
pipe. The replacement rate since 2008 is right at our annual goal of 1% per
year.
•

In June 2002, the Utilities initiated a condemnation action of Aqua Indiana’s
North Assets. On February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16.9
million, the appraised value, and took possession of those assets. The North
Assets were quickly integrated with the Utilities’ water and sewer system and
began generating revenues at existing rates from 8,600 new retail water
customers and 1,600 new retail sewer customers. At that time, Aqua Indiana

7

claimed that the purchase price was inadequate and sued for unspecified
damages.
On April 23, 2014, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works (Board) approved
an Asset Acquisition Agreement (AAA) between Aqua Indiana and the City
wherein Aqua agrees to sell its Southwest Water assets and settle the North
Asset litigation in exchange for $67 million of which $16.9 million had already
been paid. The net amount of $50.1 million will be funded through $63 million
revenue bonds which were also approved by the Board. The revenue bonds
will also provide funds for integration and financing costs. The AAA
incorporates companion agreements that provide for the treatment by Aqua’s
wastewater facilities of 1.5 million gallons per day of the City’s wastewater
flows, interim post-close transition issues and longer term shared services.
The revenue bonds require approval by Fort Wayne Common Council and the
IURC. Several other regulatory approvals and permits are needed before the
acquisition can be completed or the revenue bonds issued.
•

The Water Utility successfully acquired SRF funding in 2011 for a ultra-violet
disinfection system (UV system) valued at nearly $20 million. The UV system
was selected as the optimal incremental disinfection methodology to comply
with an EPA mandate; the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment
Rule. This UV solution was completed and on-line December 2013, ahead of
the enforcement deadline of April 2014.

•

In 2012, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) and Fort Wayne
City Council approved a three year water rate plan increasing water revenues
by 33.9%. The water rate increase will be implemented in three annual
increments (Phases) starting in January 2013. The increased revenues will
provide funding for many repair and replacement projects but, significantly, up
to 9 miles of water main replacement each year. As our infrastructure has
aged, funding for our water main replacement program has not kept pace with
the increase in our water main breaks. The new revenues will allow us to
approach our goal to replace 1%, or ten miles, of our water main pipelines per
year.
On December 18, 2013, the IURC, based on a Cost of Service Study
submitted by the City, revised Phase II and Phase III water rates that were
approved in 2012 and that were to be effective January 1, 2014 and 2015,
respectively. The revision did not affect the total anticipated revenues for
each year but did modify slightly the sources of those revenues; most
significantly for public fire protection. Prior to 2014, the City paid for public
fire protection through a per hydrant fee. Effective 2014, all water customers
will pay for public fire protection with fees based on the size of their water
meters.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
(1) Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Entity
The City of Fort Wayne Utilities (the Utilities) are collectively, a division of the City of Fort
Wayne, Indiana. The financial statements reflect only the activity of the Utilities and are not
intended to present fairly the position of the City of Fort Wayne and the results of its
operations and cash flows of its enterprise funds. The Utilities consist of Water, Wastewater,
Stormwater, and Electric Utilities in addition to the Yard Waste Facility. All five areas are
considered proprietary in nature. The Electric Utility generation and distribution systems
were sold to a private firm in 2010.
Basis of Accounting and Financial Reporting
The Utilities prepare their financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as
applied to governmental units.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses and other changes in net assets during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Utilities consider all highly liquid
investments (including restricted assets) with maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments are stated at fair value, except for short-term (less than one year), highly liquid
investments (i.e. Certificates of Deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, etc.), which are reported at
cost or amortized cost.
Restricted Assets/Net Position
All restricted assets/net position, as presented in the accompanying financial statements, are
restricted due to enabling legislation.

13

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
Capital Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, which includes interest incurred during
construction periods. Donated property, plant and equipment are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of donation. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not
add to the value of the asset or materially extend the assets’ useful lives are not capitalized.
When an individual asset is retired, depreciation is calculated. The difference between the
original cost and the calculated depreciation results in a recognized loss.
Water, Wastewater, Stormwater and Yard Waste Utilities’ assets are depreciated by
individual asset. Electric Utility assets are depreciated using the group method.
Estimated useful lives, in years, are as follows:

Buildings and improvements
Equipment and other
Distribution and collection

Net interest cost incurred on borrowed funds for the Water, Wastewater and Stormwater
Utilities is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction. In 2013, net interest
capitalized was $1,803,095 for the Water Utility, $4,028,230 for the Wastewater Utility and
$222,326 for the Stormwater Utility.
Unbilled Utility Revenue
The Water Utility accrues revenue for estimated water distributed but not yet billed as of the
balance sheet date. Likewise, the Wastewater Utility and Stormwater Utility accrue revenue
for estimated wastewater and stormwater service not yet billed as of such date.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies are stated at cost (average cost for the Water Utility; first-in, first-out
for the Wastewater Utility). Amounts for Stormwater, Electric and Yard Waste are immaterial
and not reported.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
Bond Issuance Costs, Discounts and Premiums
Bond issuance costs, discounts and premiums are amortized over the lives of the respective
bond issues using the interest method. The unamortized balance of premiums/discounts is
included in noncurrent bonds payable on the statement of net position. The unamortized
balance of bond issuance costs is reported as regulatory assets on the statement of net
position per the exception for regulated utilities.
Compensated Absences
Employees earn vacation at rates from ten days to twenty-five days per year, based on the
number of years of service. One year of unused vacation leave may be carried over to the
next. Unpaid vacation pay is recorded as a liability as the benefits accrue to the employee.
Accrued compensated absences for Utilities’ personnel are charged as an operating
expense, using the vesting method, based on earned but unused vacation and sick leave
days including the Utilities’ share of social security and medicare taxes.
Unused sick leave may be carried over from year to year. City employees must have
completed ten years of service to receive payment for unused sick leave. Unused sick leave
payoffs are calculated as follows: (1) $1.00 for each hour up to 520 hours, plus (2) 50% of
the employee’s normal straight time hourly rate times each sick leave hour over 520. In lieu
of item “2” above, the employee may receive credit at the rate of 100% of the employee’s
normal straight time hourly rate for each sick leave hour over 520 if used to purchase group
health insurance; with any remaining hours paid to the employee at the rate of 50% of
employee’s normal straight time hourly rate. There is a $25,000 limit on the amount paid for
sick time accrual. Council approved exceptions to this limit in 2000. The liability recorded for
unused sick leave is an estimate based on prior experience of the actual payoff method
chosen.
Classification of Revenue
The Utilities have classified their revenue as either operating or nonoperating according to
the following criteria:
-

Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange
transactions, such as customer charges.

-

Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange
transactions, such as contributions and other revenue sources that are defined as
nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary and
Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Government Entities That Use Proprietary Fund
Accounting, and GASB Statement 34, such as investment income.

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
Deferred Outflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred outflow of resources. This separate financial statement section element,
deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to
future periods and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources
(expense/expenditure) until then. The Wastewater utility only has one item that qualifies for
reporting in this category. It is the deferred charge on refunding reported in the statement of
net position. A deferred charge on refunding results from the difference in the carrying value
of refunded debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the
shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt.
(2) Deposits and Investments
Deposits
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government’s deposits
may not be returned to it. Indiana Code 5-13-8-1 allows a political subdivision of the State of
Indiana to deposit public funds in a financial institution only if the financial institution is a
depository eligible to receive state funds; and has a principal office or branch that qualifies to
receive public funds of the political subdivision. The bank balances were insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which covers
all public funds held in approved depositories. The Utilities do not have a formal policy for
custodial credit risk.
Investments
Authorization for investment activity is stated in Indiana Code IC 5-13. The Utilities had the
following investments at December 31, 2013.

Sinking Fund
Monthly deposits into sinking fund account for the Wastewater Utility’s net revenues is
required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual interest payment
and 1/12 of the next annual principal payment. Other related debt service requirements are
held in the debt service account.
Monthly deposits into sinking fund accounts of both the Water and Stormwater Utilities’ net
revenues are required to be in an amount equal to at least 1/6 of the next semi-annual
interest payments and 1/12 of the next annual principal payments. Upon meeting certain
17

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
minimum balance requirements, transfers may be made to unrestricted cash accounts.
Surety bonds purchased by the Utilities cover the Waterworks and Stormwater Reserve
Accounts requirements.
Debt Service Reserve
In addition to the sinking fund accounts, revenue bonds require debt service “reserve
accounts” which require funding at: the lesser of 10% of bond proceeds, the maximum
annual principal and interest required thereon, or 125% of the average annual principal and
interest requirements thereon. The Utilities calculate its debt service reserve accounts on a
consolidated basis and may fund the debt service reserve by holding cash or through the
purchase of surety bond insurance. Among other requirements, the surety bond insurer
must maintain a AAA or Aaa rating with Standards and Poor’s or Moody’s respectively.
Prior to 2009, all Utility revenue bonds’ debt service reserves were funded through surety
bond insurance except the Sewage Works Junior Revenue Bonds of 1998 A and 1998 B
which were cash funded. As a result of the financial crisis that occurred in late 2008 – early
2009 and up to and including 2013, the surety bond insurers failed to maintain their AAA/Aaa
rating. While still insured, this failure to maintain AAA/Aaa ratings required the Utilities to
cash fund the debt service reserve accounts for the affected revenue bonds. As of December
31, 2013, all surety bond insurance for Waterworks and Sewage Works Revenue Bonds
have been replaced with cash funded debt service reserves as required by bond ordinance.
The surety bond insurer for the Stormwater Management District Revenue Bonds of 2006
has failed to maintain the required AAA/Aaa rating. The appropriate disclosures have been
made to the bondholders and no other action has been taken.
Construction
Unspent bond issue proceeds to be used in the construction of designated capital assets are
included in this account.
Airport Expressway
In 2010, Water Utility entered into a tri-lateral agreement with the Redevelopment
Commission and a Developer to construct a water main extension along the airport
expressway. The Redevelopment Commission agreed to advance TIF funds to the Water
Utility at such times so as to pay the Developer according to the contractual payment
schedule. Monies received by the Water Utility prior to the Developer’s payment due date
will be held in a restricted account.

Customer Deposits
Customer deposits are refundable amounts received from Water Utility customers to insure
against nonpayment of billings or water main damages.
Connection Fees
Certain area connection fees are designated for repayment of certain development costs as
well as for reinvestment in specific areas. The unspent connection fees are reported in this
restricted category.
Septic Elimination Program
In 2009, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works authorized the creation of a City Utilities
Revolving Fund as an alternative funding source for septic tank elimination in Allen County.
This fund provides the funding necessary to construct wastewater mains allowing
homeowners to discontinue use of failing septic tanks and connect to public infrastructure.
The program also provides financial incentives to encourage septic tank elimination. Any
unexpended funds are restricted for future septic tank elimination projects.
(4) Assessments Receivable
Assessments receivable represent assessments due from customers for sewer connections.
The individual assessments range from $2,000 to $24,000 and are due in 60, 120 or 180
monthly principal installments plus interest on the unpaid portion at ranges from 0% to 7%
per year.

On March 27, 2013 the Wastewater Utility issued $7,335,000 in refunding revenue bonds
with an average interest rate of 1.00% to advance refund $2,295,000 of outstanding 2002C
series bonds with an interest rate range from 1.30% to 4.55% and $5,690,000 of outstanding
2003 series bonds with an interest rate range from 2.00% to 3.80%. The net proceeds of
$7,291,004 (after payment of $40,496 in issuance costs and $3,500 in bond discount) and
local contribution of $841,818 were used to purchase U.S. government securities. Those
securities were deposited in an irrevocable trust with an escrow agent to provide for all future
debt service payments on the 2002C series bonds and 2003 series bonds. As a result, these
bonds are considered to be defeased and the liabilities for those bonds have been removed
from the Statement of Net Position. The refunding results in the accounting loss of
$215,894, which has been recognized on the Statement of Net Position as a deferred outflow
of resources. This amount will be amortized using the straight line method and charged to
interest expense over the next 5 years. The Wastewater Utility in effect lowered its
aggregate debt service payment by $486,457 over the next 5 years and realized an
economic gain (difference between the present values of the old and new debt service
payments) of $479,970. The 2002C series bonds and 2003 series bonds were called and
paid in full in 2013.
Loans Payable:
Indiana State Revolving Fund Loan Program (SRF) is a program that provides wastewater
and drinking water loans, often at reduced interest rates and reduced issuance costs, to
Indiana cities and towns. SRF “draw-down” loans are awarded as a “not-to-exceed” loan
amount and the amount is later fixed at the amount actually borrowed to complete the preestablished wastewater or drinking water projects. The interest rate is fixed at the time of the
award and the duration is established shortly thereafter. For shared pool loans, SRF
coordinates the financing activities for several Indiana communities and issues bonds on the
open market to provide the funding for each community’s projects. The loan amount, interest
rate and duration are fixed at the time of the consolidated loan’s issuance. Occasionally,
SRF will make traditional loans with fixed rate, amount and duration.

(10) Equity Transfers
The 10-year sewer capacity improvement program includes storm sewer construction funded
through the Wastewater Utility or Stormwater Utility. New storm sewers allow old combined
sewers to be converted to sanitary-only lines. As projects are completed, the new storm
sewers are transferred from the Wastewater Utility to the Stormwater Utility and new sanitary
30

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
sewers are transferred from Stormwater Utility to Wastewater Utility. The amount transferred
from Wastewater Utility to Stormwater Utility was $2,587,423 in 2013.
(11) Risk Management
The City, including the Utilities, retains the risk of loss for claims related to employee health,
on-the-job injury, auto, and general liabilities, while continuing to buy premium insurance for
a number of other risks. The City has established internal service funds to finance these
risks. Interfund premiums are billed monthly on a cost allocation basis most appropriate to
the type of risk involved. An excess policy covers individual health insurance claims in
excess of $250,000 per year and the insurance company assumes the risk when total
monthly claims exceed an amount based upon an aggregate monthly factor. An excess
policy for workers compensation covers individual claims in excess of $150,000 per
employee per injury. The general and auto liability is limited by Indiana government tort
liability limits of $700,000 per person and incident. Liabilities are the responsibility of the
City’s internal service funds.
(12) Pension Plan
Public Employees’ Retirement Fund
Plan Description
The Utilities contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund (PERF), a defined-benefit
pension plan. PERF is an agent multiple-employer public employee retirement system, which
provides retirement benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. All full-time employees are
eligible to participate in the defined-benefit plan.
State statutes (IC 5-10.2 and 5-10.3) govern most requirements of the system and give the
Utilities authority to contribute to the plan. PERF retirement benefits consist of employer
provided contributions plus an annuity provided by the member’s annuity savings account. The
annuity savings account consists of member’s contributions, set by statute at three percent of
compensation, plus the interest credited to the member’s account. The employer may elect to
make the contributions on behalf of the member.
PERF issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required
supplementary information for the plan as a whole and for its participants. That report may be
obtained by writing the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), One North Capitol Street,
Suite 001, Indianapolis, IN 46204 or by calling (888) 526-1687.
Retirement benefits vest after 10 years of service. Normal retirement is defined as the earliest
of: (1) age 65 with 10 years of creditable service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of creditable service;
or (3) the sum of age and creditable service equal to 85, but not earlier than age 55. A reduced
benefit will be received if an employee takes early retirement between the ages of 50 and 65
and has had 15 or more years of creditable service. Employees may elect to either receive a
31

CITY OF FORT WAYNE UTILITIES
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2013
lump-sum distribution of their annuity savings account balance upon retirement or receive an
annuity amount as a monthly supplement to the retirement benefits described above. PERF
also provides death and disability benefits. These benefit provisions and all other requirements
are established by state statute and ordinance.
Funding Policy and Annual Pension Cost
The INPRS Board of Trustees establishes contribution requirements for plan members. The

The NPO amount is for the Utility as a whole. The NPO amount is allocated between the
Utilities three major funds based upon a percentage of expenditures for the three Utilities.
(13) Commitments and Contingencies
Consent Decree:
The Utilities’ combined storm and sanitary sewer system does not comply with federal Clean
Water regulations. After several years of negotiations with the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the EPA
lodged a Consent Decree with the federal court on December 28, 2007. The Consent Decree
became effective April 1, 2008. Under the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree, the
Utilities committed to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) days in a typical
year to one day on the St. Joseph River and four days on the St. Mary’s and Maumee Rivers.
The infrastructure cost to reduce the number of CSO events is approximately $240 million, to
be spent over the next 18 years, concluding in 2025. The Utilities also agreed to eliminate
three known sanitary sewer overflows at an estimated combined cost of $31 million by specific
dates noted in the Consent Decree. Additionally, the Utilities committed to maintain the entire
sewer system to performance standards prescribed in the Utilities’ Long-Term Control Plan
incorporated by reference into the Consent Decree. The Consent Decree further provides for
stipulated penalties for failure to achieve specified construction milestones, reporting deadlines
or maintenance objectives. The Utilities are in full compliance with the Consent Decree’s terms
and conditions.
Condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets:
In June, 2002, the Utilities initiated condemnation of Aqua Indiana’s North Assets. On
February 12, 2008, the Utilities paid Aqua Indiana $16.9 million and took possession of those
condemned assets. The North Assets are now fully integrated with the Utilities’ water and
sewer systems and generating revenues for the respective Utilities at standard system-wide
tariffs.
The purchase price was established through condemnation proceedings by Fort Wayne Board
of Public Works and is currently being contested by Aqua Indiana in Wells County Circuit
Court. Both Aqua Indiana and the City had tentatively agreed in a Letter of Intent signed June
27, 2013 to dismiss the litigation regarding the value of the North assets in exchange for other
terms and conditions. Subsequently, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works approved the
definitive “Asset Acquisition Agreement” (AAA) converting the Letter of Intent into an actionable
transaction (see note 14).

(14) Subsequent Events
On April 23, 2014, the Fort Wayne Board of Public Works approved the Asset Acquisition
Agreement (“AAA”) between Aqua Indiana, Inc. (Aqua) and the City of Fort Wayne (City)
(together the Parties) wherein Aqua agrees to sell its Southwest water assets and settle the
Aqua North Asset litigation in exchange for $67 million of which $16.9 million has already
been paid. The “AAA” has many Exhibits and three ancillary agreements. Under the first
ancillary agreement, Aqua agrees to treat 1.5 million gallons of sewage from the City per day
for 10 years with an additional 5 years at varying volumes at the City’s discretion. The other
two agreements address post acquisition issues such as: 1) job opportunities for any
displaced Aqua employees, 2) meter reading services to enable Aqua to bill its sewer
customers, 3) sewer territory modifications and protection, 4) sewer rate management and
other matters.
The Fort Wayne Board of Public Works also approved the issuance of $63 million Water
revenue bonds to provide funds for the remaining purchase price (total purchase price of $67
million less the $16.9 million already paid for the North assets), the cost of integrating Aqua’s
water system with the City’s water system and bond financing costs. The term of the bond
may be up to 30 years and the interest rate cannot exceed 7%.
Both the Asset Acquisition Agreement with all its companion exhibits and agreements and
the proposed revenue bond require Fort Wayne Common Council approval as well as

Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approval. Aqua is also under the IURC
jurisdiction and will require IURC approval to divest itself of its Southwest water assets,
among other things.
