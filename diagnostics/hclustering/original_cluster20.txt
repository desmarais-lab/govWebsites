Public safety teamwork leads to arrests in less than a week
Frankfort, IN ‚Äì Through the investigative teamwork of Frankfort‚Äôs Fire and
Police Departments, two suspects were arrested yesterday for burglary and arson
of an abandoned house at 514 Ohio Street, with the case solved less than a week
from the July 14 fire.
Frankfort Fire Department C Crew responded to the house fire at approximately
9:00 a.m. last Saturday and quickly extinguished the fire in about an hour.
Seeing evidence of a possible arson, Battalion Chief Jeremy Warren called in
Chief Fire Investigator Jeff Cline who quickly determined the fire had been
set.
Cline contacted Frankfort Police and the two agencies worked closely together
in the following days to gather evidence and find those responsible for the
crime.
According to Cline, arson cases can be challenging. He credits Police Detective
Jason Albaugh for his skillful police work.
     ‚ÄúThanks to our proactive, joint efforts, a fire within our
     community was determined to be arson and less than a week later, two
     suspects are in custody. We appreciate teaming up with the police and
     believe combining our collective investigative knowledge was key in
     achieving quick results in this case,‚Äù Cline said.
Twenty-three-year-old AJ Beard and a juvenile male currently are being
detained, each arrested on two B felonies for burglary and arson.
For questions or interview requests, contact Chief Fire Investigator Jeff Cline
at 654-4329 or Detective Jason Albaugh at 654-4277.

    * Published on May 3, 2012
    * under Mayor_Updates, News, Proclamations

WHEREAS, throughout our history, Americans have relied on prayer for strength,
inspiration, guidance and peace; and,
WHEREAS, the National Day of Prayer was created in 1952 by a joint resolution
of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Harry Truman; and,
WHEREAS, this special event is held the first Thursday in May each year when
people are asked ‚Äúto turn to God in prayer and meditation‚Äù; and,
WHEREAS, 2012 marks the 61st annual observance of the National Day of Prayer
with the theme One Nation Under God with a parallel theme found in Psalm 33:12,
‚ÄúBlessed is the nation whose God is the Lord‚Äù; and,
WHEREAS, in current times, countless Americans turn to prayer for comfort and
wisdom, praying not only for themselves, but for their communities, their
country and the world; and,
WHEREAS, the National Day of Prayer and Frankfort‚Äôs local prayer service is
open to people of all faiths; and,
WHEREAS, so many selfless citizens deserve our prayers and support, including
the men and women of our Armed Forces, their loving families and our courageous
police officers, firefighters and other first responders ‚Äì all of whom put
themselves in harm‚Äôs way to protect their fellow citizens; and,
WHEREAS, those who struggle in daily life with illness, poverty, loss of
employment and a host of other challenges deserve our prayers and God‚Äôs
blessings as well;
NOW THEREFORE, I, Chris McBarnes, invite all citizens of Frankfort as their own
faith and conscience directs them to join me in giving thanks for the many
blessings we as a community, state and nation enjoy and in asking for God‚Äôs
continued guidance, mercy and protection, do hereby proclaim Thursday, May 3,
2012 as

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 3rd day of May, 2012.

Community invited to Generation Rescue fish fry
Frankfort, IN ‚Äì Frankfort police officers in partnership with Montgomery
Aviation will host their fourth annual fish fry fundraiser to raise money in
support of Generation Rescue, a national organization dedicated to helping
those with autism on Saturday, June 30 from 4:00 ‚Äì 8:00 p.m. at the Frankfort
Municipal Airport.
Available at the door the day of the event, tickets are $5.00 for kids 6-12 and
$10.00 for adults.
According to Police Chief Troy Bacon, Frankfort officers have been granted a
temporary relaxation of the facial hair policy that will permit officers to
grow a goatee or sole patch for the generous donation of at least $20.00. All
moneys collected will be donated to Generation Rescue.
     ‚ÄúThe police department is very excited to be fundraising for
     Generation Rescue again this year. Autism affects so many nationwide
     and locally as well,‚Äù said Bacon.
Affecting how information is processed in the brain by altering how nerve cells
and their synapses connect and organize, autism is characterized by impaired
social interaction, communication and restricted repetitive behavior.
Frankfort Police Detective Robert Hession who has twin sons diagnosed with
autism has spearheaded local fundraising for the past three years, including
chairing the annual fish fry.
     ‚ÄúAs the fastest growing serious developmental disability in the
     U.S., one out of 110 children are diagnosed with autism; a number
     higher than diabetes, pediatric cancer and AIDS combined and the
     number is growing. The condition affects one in 70 boys.
     ‚ÄúDespite these startling statistics, autism research receives less
     than five percent of the research funding of many less prevalent
     childhood diseases,‚Äù Hession said.
According to Hession, for the last three years, the Frankfort Police Department
and Frankfort community are the only groups in the U.S. doing anything similar
to this fundraiser for Generation Rescue.
     ‚ÄúWe are asking local businesses and organizations to show their
     support by making a monetary or product donation to the event. With
     all proceeds going to Generation Rescue, we need everyone‚Äôs help to
     make our June 30 event a success in fighting autism,‚Äù Hession said.
Generation Rescue funds biomedical treatment for autism as well as provides
community outreach, education and resources for families of children with
autism and other services including their Rescue Angel project.
The Frankfort Municipal Airport is located at 3009 West State Road 28.
For questions or interview requests, contact Detective Hession at 654-4277,
ext. 255.
