Wellness Pays
Did you know the City‚Äôs health plan pays for your first $500 of preventive care each year? Get a
routine physical, schedule age- and gender-appropriate screenings as recommended by the National
Institutes of Health (www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002125.htm) and/or your physician,
and make sure your inoculations are up-to-date. Your rewards will include a preventive approach to
healthcare, a better understanding of your risks and early warning of potential health problems.

Winners of the first
quarter team walking
challenge, who walked
the distance to Los
Angeles and beyond,
each received a $200
check. Team members

More big winners (or losers!) will be announced after July 1, when the team weight loss challenge
ends. The third quarter will bring additional opportunities for participants to improve their health,
challenge their bodies, awe their co-workers and win cash prizes.

Start Over with a Clean Plate
The food pyramid has been dismantled in favor of a
simple plate icon that urges Americans to eat a
more plant-based diet. One half of your plate
should be filled with fruits and vegetables, with
whole grains and lean protein on the other half,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Low-fat dairy on the side, such as a cup of skim
milk or yogurt, is also suggested.
The new plate icon is designed to remind Americans
to adopt healthier eating habits, in a time when
more than one-third of children and more than twothirds of adults in the United States are
overweight or obese.
"It's an opportunity for Americans to understand quickly how to have a balanced and nutritious
meal," said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. "It's a constant reminder as you look at your own
plate whether your portion sizes are right, whether you've got enough fruits and vegetables on that
plate."
For more information on healthy eating‚Äîa LOT more‚Äîgo to www.myplate.gov.

Invest in an Irrigation System
Using an automated irrigation system is one of the best ways to keep your lawn and landscape
beautiful and healthy, while minimizing water waste. Plan carefully for a reliable, flexible
irrigation system that can grow and evolve along with your landscaping.
‚Ä¢

Use components that provide flexibility. Different plants have different watering needs,
and these needs may change over time. Your system should allow you to apply the right
amount of water for each type of plant by the most effective method.

‚Ä¢

Install excess capacity. Irrigation zones are areas that are watered by the same irrigation
valve and plumbing. Installing extra connections now makes it easier and less expensive to
expand your irrigation system later.

‚Ä¢

Think smart. Include ‚Äúsmart‚Äù controls that automatically adjust watering based on rain, soil
moisture, evaporation and plant water use.

‚Ä¢

Check water pressure. Low or high pressure can seriously affect sprinkler performance;
choose sprinklers based on the water pressure on your site.

‚Ä¢

Buy the best. Use the best components you can afford to minimize future maintenance and
total lifetime cost of your system.

‚Ä¢

Meet code requirements. Include the right backflow prevention device for your area.
Required by the National Plumbing Code for all irrigation systems, backflow prevention
devices prevent irrigation system water from contaminating the water supply.

‚Ä¢

Dig deep. Install lines deep enough to protect them from damage from aeration and other
lawn maintenance.

‚Ä¢

Look for savings. Many water utilities offer rebates for certain water-efficient products.
Before finalizing your new system, consult with your local water provider.

‚Ä¢

Hire carefully. Even the best irrigation system won‚Äôt perform well if installed incorrectly
when looking to hire a designer or contractor, always get multiple bids, check references,
and confirm all vendors are insured.

Smart Irrigation Month is an initiative of the Irrigation Association, a non-profit industry
organization dedicated to promoting efficient irrigation. Learn more at
www.smartirrigationmonth.org.
To find an IA-certified professional to design, install, maintain or audit your irrigation system,

WATER POLLUTION
Sources of water pollution like
industrial wastes from factories have
been greatly reduced in recent years.
Now, more than 60% of water
pollution comes from things like cars
leaking oil, fertilizer from farms and
gardens, and failing septic tanks. All
these sources add up to a big pollution problem. So, believe it or not, the biggest source of water pollution today is
not industry ‚Äì it is actually households like yours. But each of us can do small things to help clean up our water. And
it starts with realizing that our sewers and storm systems are separate ‚Äì what goes into storm drains flows directly

into the environment, untreated.

WHAT‚ÄôS THE PROBLEM WITH FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES, AND HERBICIDES?

Fertilizer isn‚Äôt a problem if it is used carefully. If you use too much fertilizer or apply it at the wrong time, it can
easily wash off your lawn or garden into storm drains and then flow untreated into lakes or streams. Just as in your
garden, fertilizer in lakes and streams fuels plant growth. Fertilizers contain "nutrients" such as nitrates and
phosphates. Excess nutrients over-stimulate the growth of aquatic plants and algae, which clog our waterways and
block light to deeper waters while the organisms are alive; when the organisms die, they use up dissolved oxygen as
they decompose, causing oxygen-poor waters that support only diminished amounts of marine life. Such areas are
commonly called dead zones (like in the Gulf of Mexico every spring).

FACTS AND FIGURES
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Phosphorus (the middle number on the fertilizer bag) is ‚Äújunk food‚Äù for algae. One pound of phosphorus can
produce 10,000 pounds of wet weeds and algae.
Pesticides that get applied to farm fields and roadsides (and homeowners' lawns) run off into local streams
and rivers. It is tempting to think this is mostly a farming problem, but on a square-foot basis, homeowners
apply even more chemicals to their lawns than farmers do to their fields!
Water utilities in the Midwest spend $400 million each year to treat water for the chemical pesticide Atrazine.

WHAT YOU CAN DO
How can you fertilize and help keep our waters clean?
‚Ä¢ Use fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides sparingly. Many plants do not need as much fertilizer or need it as
often as you might think. Whatever you put on your lawn could find its way into the stream.
‚Ä¢ Choose fertilizer with a low phosphorus number (middle number). Only newly-seeded lawns or phosphorusdeficient soils require phosphorus.
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt fertilize before a rain storm.
‚Ä¢ Consider using organic fertilizers;
they release nutrients more slowly.
‚Ä¢ Sweep fertilizers and other chemicals
that get on the driveway/sidewalk
back onto your lawn to keep them
out of our storm drains.
‚Ä¢ Use commercially available compost or make your own using
garden waste. Mixing compost with your soil means your plants will
need less chemical fertilizer and it puts your waste to good use.

ICE (In Case of Emergency)
At no time must critical care intervention be disturbed for the pursuance of ICE
information. In this setting, responsibility for obtaining ICE information should be
obtained by other responsible bystanders on scene.
What is ICE?
ICE has been devised in response to research that shows that 80% of people do not carry any
emergency contact details with them at all times.
Although a similar proportion of those people do now carry a mobile phone, which if used
correctly, can speed up notification of next of kin or designated contacts following an accident
or an emergency.
Other benefits of ICE can help with identification, and gaining details of the individual‚Äôs
medical history, including medical conditions, allergies, blood type etc.
The role of the public
People who carry a mobile phone are being encouraged to prefix an existing contact in their
phone‚Äôs address book with the acronym ICE (In Case of Emergency).
The ICE contact should be someone who can be reached if an individual becomes sick or
injured to such an extent that they are unable to communicate. The contact should be made
fully aware that they have been designated as such.
The role of the responder
All personnel attending an individual who is sick or injured should try to to seek ICE in any
phone obviously belonging to a patient.
Note: Limitations
The mobile phone system can work for all phone owners, but has limitations in some
circumstances, such as:
‚Ä¢ Where the phone is protected with a password
‚Ä¢ Where is it damaged or the battery is flat
‚Ä¢ Where the responder cannot be sure it belongs to the casualty
To the General Public:
Please use ICE, it may save you or one of your loved one‚Äôs life.

Coordination of Benefits

The City‚Äôs insurance plan has a system to determine who is responsible for claims when there are
multiple payers; this system is referred to as ‚Äúcoordination of benefits.‚Äù For City employees, the
City‚Äôs plan is always primary. However, if one of your dependents has other coverage through a
spouse‚Äôs employer, Medicare or some other plan, the City‚Äôs plan may be secondary.
Our plan requires annual coordination of benefits information for your dependents. The first time
each dependent incurs a claim each year, BAS will send you a ‚ÄúMedical Claim Form‚Äù to gather
information about other coverage. If the dependent has no other coverage, which is most often
the case, you simply indicate that on the form. No claim will be paid for that particular dependent
until you complete and return the form. Contact Sue Coy at scoy@carmel.in.gov of X5850 if you
have questions about this process.
Please keep in mind that coordination of benefits is not a bureaucratic nuisance. It is a protection
for all of us‚Äîa means to ensure that our plan pays only those claims for which it is legally
responsible.

Waisting Away

More than 80 employees are participating in the third quarter individual weight loss challenge. A
new walking challenge is coming soon. Best of luck to challenge participants, and congratulations to
all employees who have made an active commitment to their own good health.

Hot, Hot, Hot

Temperatures in the 90s and heat indices in excess of 100 are expected to last at least another
week. Extreme heat and humidity are not only uncomfortable‚Äîthey are dangerous. These tips
come from the New York City Office of Emergency Management.
Quick Heat-Beating Tips
ÔÇ∑

If possible, stay out of the sun. When in the sun, wear sunscreen (at least SPF 15) and a hat to
protect your face and head.

ÔÇ∑

Use an air conditioner if you have one. Set the thermostat no lower than 78 degrees.

ÔÇ∑

If you do not have an air conditioner, keep rooms well-ventilated with open windows and fans.
(Fans work best at night, when they can bring in cooler air from outside.) Consider going to a
public pool or an air-conditioned store, mall or movie theater.

ÔÇ∑

Make a special effort to check on your neighbors during a heat wave, especially if they are
seniors, young children or people with special needs. Many older residents live alone and could
suffer unnecessarily in the heat because they are isolated from friends and family.

ÔÇ∑

Seniors and others who may be sensitive to extreme heat should contact friends, neighbors or
relatives at least twice a day during a heat wave.

ÔÇ∑

Drink fluids‚Äîparticularly water‚Äîeven if you don‚Äôt feel thirsty.* Avoid beverages containing
alcohol, caffeine or high amounts of sugar.

ÔÇ∑

Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose clothing that covers as much of your skin as possible.

ÔÇ∑

Never leave children, pets or those who require special care in a parked car during periods of
intense summer heat.

ÔÇ∑

Avoid strenuous activity, especially during the sun‚Äôs peak hours‚Äî11 AM to 4 PM. If you must
engage in strenuous activity, do it during the coolest part of the day‚Äîusually between 4 AM and
7 AM.

ÔÇ∑

Cool showers or baths may be helpful, but avoid extreme temperature changes. Never take a
shower immediately after becoming overheated‚Äîextreme temperature changes may make you
ill, nauseated or dizzy.
*People with heart, kidney or liver disease, or those on fluid-restricted diets, should check with their doctors before
increasing fluid intake.

Heat-Related Illnesses
ÔÇ∑

Heat Cramps: Heat cramps are muscular pains and spasms, usually in the leg or stomach
muscles, resulting from heavy exertion during extreme heat. Heat cramps usually occur when
the heat index is between 90 and 105 degrees. Although heat cramps are the least severe of all
Volume 12, Issue VII

7/25/11

heat-related health problems, they are often the first signal that the body is having trouble
coping with the heat and should be treated immediately with rest and fluids. Stretching, gentle
massaging of the spasms or direct, firm pressure on cramps can reduce pain. Seek medical
attention if pain is severe or nausea occurs.
ÔÇ∑

Heat Exhaustion: Heat exhaustion occurs when body fluids are lost through heavy sweating due
to vigorous exercise or working in a hot, humid place. Blood flow to the skin increases, causing
blood flow to vital organs to decrease. Symptoms include: sweating, pale and clammy skin,
fatigue, headache, dizziness, shallow breaths and a weak pulse.
Heat exhaustion should be treated with rest in a cool area, sipping water or electrolyte
solutions, applying cool and wet cloths, elevating the feet 12 inches and further medical
treatment in severe cases. If not treated, the victim's condition may escalate to heat stroke.
If the victim does not respond to basic treatment, seek medical attention. Heat exhaustion
usually occurs when the heat index is between 90 and 105 degrees.

ÔÇ∑

Heat Stroke: Heat stroke‚Äîalso called "sunstroke"‚Äîoccurs when the victim's temperature
control system, which produces perspiration to cool the body, stops working. The skin is flushed,
hot and dry, and body temperature may be elevated. In fact, body temperature can rise so high
that brain damage and death may result if the body is not cooled quickly. The victim may also be
confused, develop seizures, breathe shallowly and have a weak, rapid pulse.
Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness and people exhibiting its symptoms should
seek emergency medical attention. Heat stroke usually occurs when the heat index is 130
degrees or higher, but can occur when the heat index surpasses 105 degrees.

Springtime Choices Impact Our Local Water Quality
Jill Hoffmann, Upper White River Watershed Coordinator
There are plenty of signs that spring is in full force. Sometime these signs are natural
indicators like flowers poking through weathered mulch, or migrating birds, like
sandhill cranes flying far overhead. Others are signs of human life awakening after
winter. Signs like people cleaning up boats, or washing cars and bikes in their drives,
or the often dreaded spring yard clean-up. All can bring potential risks to local water
quality.
As you are preparing your home and yard this spring, be sure to consider the impacts your lawn has on water
quality. Your individual choices and actions make a difference!
Your Lawn Fertilizer Choices
Many mature lawns do not need fertilizers, particularly fertilizer with phosphorus in it. Remember one pound of
phosphorus running off into the water can grow 500 pounds of algae.
 Follow the instructions on the bag and use only the right amount. More is not better! Any fertilizer that
is not used by your lawn will end up in local stream or reservoir ‚Äì growing potentially toxic algae and
producing bad tasting water.
 If you use a lawn care company, make sure to talk to them about no-phosphorus fertilizer and minimum
application rates throughout the season.
 If you are already using no-phosphorus fertilizer, or no
fertilizer at all, or if you are asking your applicator to use no-P
products, take the no-phosphorus pledge at
www.ClearChoicesCleanWater.org.
Check it out to see how many people are on the map ‚Äì take the pledge
to show your support for healthy Indiana waters and get on the map yourself!
Your Yard Clean-up Choices
There are several natural ‚Äòfertilizers‚Äô and pollutants that accumulate over the winter, decompose, and find their
way into the water as well. Leaf litter, pet waste, and general landscaping yard waste all contain nutrients such
as phosphorus that can add to spring and summer algal blooms.
 Please bag or compost leaves ‚Äì do not rake leaves or other yard
waste like last year‚Äôs flower stalks or grass clippings into ponds,
streams, drainage ditches, or storm drains!
 Pick up and dispose of pet waste in the garbage!
Other simple spring-cleaning backyard behaviors like car or boat washing
and oil changes can also be a significant source of nutrients and other
pollutants to the local streams and drinking water supplies.
‚Ä¢ Used oil from a single oil change can pollute up to 1,000,000 gallons of freshwater.
‚Ä¢ In order for one ounce of biodegradable detergent to be safe for fish, it needs to be diluted by almost
20,000 ounces of water.
These pollutants get to the reservoir through direct runoff from yards or street-side storm drain inlets that
discharge, untreated, to nearby streams, or to the reservoir itself.
Consider the choices you are making around your home as you begin spring yard work. Protecting local water
quality in the City of Carmel requires everyone to do their part to make sure their property doesn‚Äôt contribute
pollution to our water supplies. You can make a difference ‚Äì make a clear choice for clean water!

Guidelines for Debris Removal from Streams or Ditches
within the City of Carmel
Removing debris and logjams from streams or ditches within the City of Carmel is
regulated by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or the Hamilton
County Surveyor‚Äôs office. The City of Carmel does NOT remove logjams or debris on
private property.
If the property is traversed by a regulated drain then the Hamilton County Surveyor‚Äôs
Office (317-776-8495) should be contacted for removal guidelines and to determine if
they will remove the obstruction.
If the property is traversed by a stream, then the property owner is responsible for the
removal of the logjam or debris. Unless the removal operation meets the exemption
requirements (see below), the project must be permitted by DNR before the operation can
begin. The City reserves the right to request that the owner or responsible party clear and
maintain existing watercourses at their own expense in accordance with DNR guidelines
to ensure effective watercourse drainage.
The City of Carmel Engineering Department may be contacted at 317-571-2441 for
guidance on which agency regulates logjam or debris removal on the stream or ditch.

Do I need a permit?
1. If the debris or a logjam can be removed by meeting the following conditions,
then a permit is not required;
a. Only hand-held tools, such as chainsaws, axes, hand-saws, etc., may be
used in the stream channel.
b. Do not grub (pull out) trees or tree stumps from the bank. Leaving stumps
holds the bank from eroding.
c. No earth-moving should occur. Do not remove sandbars or other soil,
sediment, sand, or gravel from the creek. These provide habitat for fish
and other aquatic species.
d. All trees, brush, and debris that are causing severe obstruction to flow and
are proposed for removal, shall be removed from the channel so as not to
float downstream during a flood and create another blockage.
e. Fallen trees and debris may be dragged from the stream using cables,
winches, and vehicles provided the vehicles are NOT used below the top
of banks.
f. Brush and fallen trees in a creek provide food, shelter, and other benefits
to fish and wildlife. Leave as much as possible in a Natural Condition,
untouched by humans.

2. If motorized, vehicular equipment, such as a small tractor, backhoe, bulldozer, log
skidder, four wheel drive truck, etc. (any heavy equipment), is proposed for use in
the stream channel, or anywhere below the top of banks, then the project is NOT
exempt from permitting. A Notification of Construction in a Floodway Under IC
14-28-1 for Obstruction Removal for River and Stream Maintenance form must
be completed and submitted to DNR. For more information please refer to the
DNR Logjam FAQ document or visit www.in.gov/dnr/water.

WATER POLLUTION
Sources of water pollution like
industrial wastes from factories have
been greatly reduced in recent years.
Now, more than 60% of water
pollution comes from things like trash
and litter, excess fertilizer, and pet
waste. All these sources add up to a
big pollution problem. So, believe it
or not, the biggest source of water pollution today is not industry ‚Äì it is actually households like yours. But each of us
can do small things to help clean up our water. And it starts with realizing that our sewers and storm systems are
separate ‚Äì what goes into storm drains flows directly into the environment, untreated.

WHAT‚ÄôS THE PROBLEM WITH LITTER?
When debris‚Äîplastic bags, bottles, cigarette butts, etc‚Äîis thrown on the ground, it gets washed into storm drains and
directly into our waterways. In addition to potentially choking, suffocating, or disabling aquatic life like ducks, fish,
turtles, and birds, litter decreases oxygen levels in the water when it decays. Litter is one of the most unsightly forms of
pollution in our local waterways and can easily be prevented. Most litter can be recycled, which not only protects the
environment, it saves our natural resources.

FACTS AND FIGURES
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

Every day the average person walks or drives by 12,000 items of litter.
MYTH: Cigarette filters are biodegradable. FACT: The acetate filters can take many years to decompose. Also,
the toxic chemicals the filter was designed to trap leak out into aquatic ecosystems, threatening marine life.
Cigarette butts may seem small, but with several trillion butts littered every year they are the number one
source of litter in this county.
The lifespan (decomposition time) of some commonly littered items:
CIGARETTE BUTT: 1-5 years
PLASTIC BAG:
10-20 years
ALUMINUM CAN: 200-500 years
GLASS BOTTLE: 1 million years

WHAT YOU CAN DO
How can you help keep our waters clean?
‚Ä¢ DO NOT LITTER! Carry a bag for waste along in the car to eliminate the temptation to throw it out the
window. Put litter in your pocket until you find a recycling container or trash can.
‚Ä¢ Recycle and reuse items whenever possible. Glass, paper, metal,
cardboard, and plastic can be taken to the recycle bins behind
Household Hazardous Waste for free (1717 Pleasant St., Noblesville).
‚Ä¢ Pick up ONE piece of litter every day! That's 365 less pieces of litter on
our streets, in our parks, and around our schools thanks to you.
Imagine if everyone picked up just one piece!
‚Ä¢ Make sure your trash bins have lids that can be securely attached. Do
not put out open containers or boxes filled with debris.
‚Ä¢ Keep litter out of pick up truck beds and cover loads so items are not
blown off to the ground.
‚Ä¢ Join a clean-up event. Many civic groups host such events. One
opportunity is the White River clean-up day held every September.

Smart Irrigation: Technologies that Use
Water Efficiently
July is Smart Irrigation Month, and the start of summer is a great time to improve the
efficiency of your outdoor irrigation system or install a water-efficient automatic irrigation
system. There are many ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technologies available today that allow you to maintain
beautiful landscapes while maximizing water efficiency. Here are some to consider
whether you do it yourself or through a professional contractor.
Rain/Freeze Sensors
Rain sensors prevent irrigation systems from running when it is raining and right after
rain events when irrigation is unnecessary. Rain/freeze sensors add the ability to stop
irrigation when temperatures approach freezing to prevent ice on landscapes and
hardscapes. These devices can reduce irrigation water usage up to 35 percent and help
extend irrigation system life. Sprinkler systems should never run in the rain, and rain
sensors can put an end to those wasteful and embarrassing situations.
Weather-based Controllers
Weather-based controllers actually adjust irrigation schedules based on local weather
conditions. These climate-based systems gather local weather information and some
even factor in your exact landscape (types of plants, soils, slopes, etc.) to make irrigation
run-time adjustments so your landscape always receives the appropriate amount of
water. There is a wide range of products in this category with various weather input
options and landscape-specific adjustment factors. The water savings can be substantial
and the convenience of these self-adjusting controllers is another great benefit.
Sensor-based Controllers
Sensor-based controllers rely on soil moisture sensors placed below ground in the root
zones of lawns and landscapes to determine if and how long to water. Soils may be
maintained between lower and upper target moisture levels for optimal plant health.
Alternatively, a simpler decision is to schedule the regular irrigation program to run
based on the soil moisture. Weather-based and sensor-based control products are
available as stand-alone controllers or add-on devices to existing controllers. Each has
been shown to reduce irrigation water usage up to 70 percent without sacrificing the
quality of your landscaping.
Pressure Regulation
All sprinklers operate best at a certain water pressure. At those pressures the water
distribution is most uniform over the target area. That allows shorter run times because
for an entire lawn to be green you basically end up setting a schedule to provide
sufficient water to the driest spot. Reducing high pressure also eliminates problems such
as misting sprinklers and potential irrigation system damage. And for every 5-point
reduction in water pressure you actually use 6 to 8 percent less water. Those savings
can add up quickly. Water pressure regulation devices are easily added to valves to
control a whole irrigation zone or can be added to individual sprinklers.
Low Precipitation Rate and High-Efficiency Nozzles
Many great sprinkler nozzles are on the market today that use lower precipitation rates
to reduce run-off or offer improved water distribution uniformity. Distribution uniformity is

very important to reducing watering run times. Again, you want the entire area being
watered to receive sufficient water to maintain green lawns and colorful plants, so the
more uniform the water distribution, the shorter the watering run time will be for the driest
spot. Be sure to inquire about these critical considerations when selecting sprinklers and
nozzles.
Drip Irrigation
Drip irrigation systems are very different from pop-up sprinkler systems. Rather than
spraying wide areas, they generally utilize point emitters to deliver desired volumes of
water to particular locations at or near plant root zones. Water drips slowly from emitters
either onto the soil surface or below ground. Less water is lost to wind and evaporation
as a result, and weeds can also be reduced. Drip irrigation systems are very waterefficient and customizable for even different plants in a small area.
All of these water-efficient products can reduce water use and your water bills without
sacrificing plant and landscape health. You can still enjoy all of the benefits associated
with attractive and enjoyable landscapes on your property while helping to conserve a
precious natural resource. Please take advantage of these cost-saving ideas that are
good for you and good for the planet.
Smart Irrigation Month is an initiative of the Irrigation Association, a non-profit industry
organization dedicated to promoting efficient irrigation. Learn more at
