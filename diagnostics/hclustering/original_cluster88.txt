Assessment Cap Sustained; Petitioner contends the land is a side yard to their home and should be under Cap 2; Petition denied as the land is a separately
assessed vacant lot and per statue is "other land" and therefore placed under Cap 3. Petitioner may consider filing a combination form to include the current
vacant lot into their Primary lot in order to adjust the land classification.

Per counsel: “I.C. 6-1.1-12-37 provides that a homestead deduction, among other things, is provided to an individual who is “entitled to occupy as a tenant
stockholder (as defined in 26 USC 216) of a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in 26 USC 216).” These individuals who reside at these residences are
not tenant stockholders as defined by statute, thus, they are not entitled to a homestead deduction and no error has occurred. Assessment is sustained.

County met the burden by providing a prima facie case for a lesser AV from the appealed AV and presents such value. Petitioner/Rep did not make a prima facie
case by failing to submit an appropriate Fee Simple approach to value. Recommendation is to accept the County presented values here.

Petitioner submitted comps, however those comps contained no sales values or assessed values to compare against the subject, nor did the Petitioner offer a
value different than the appealed assessed value, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. The County submitted minimal sales data that did not validate their
offer of $150k, which was declined by the Petitioner anyway. Examiner review of Assessed Values from Petitioners submitted comps and review of the Trending
ratio, supports the recommended reduction.

Petitioner argued the structual & land assessments. but failed to address the market conditions, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. If the Assessor
makes structual or land adjustments, further adjustments would then be made to be reflective to the market. Regardless of the structual or land assessments, the
value would remain unchanged as the market conditions, per the taxpayers rents in comparison, as presented by the County, sustains the Assessed Value.

Minutes:
Petitioner argued the structual & land assessments. but failed to address the market conditions, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. If the Assessor
makes structual or land adjustments, further adjustments would then be made to be reflective to the market. Regardless of the structual or land assessments, the
improvement value would remain unchanged as the market conditions, per the taxpayers rents in comparison, as presented by the County, includes the land
value & sustains the improvement value.

Minutes:
Petitioner argued the structual & land assessments. but failed to address the market conditions, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. If the Assessor
makes structual or land adjustments, further adjustments would then be made to be reflective to the market. Regardless of the structual or land assessments, the
value would remain unchanged as the market conditions, per the taxpayers rents in comparison, as presented by the County, sustains the Assessed Value.

Petitioner argued the structual & land assessments. but failed to address the market conditions, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. If the Assessor
makes structual or land adjustments, further adjustments would then be made to be reflective to the market. Regardless of the structual or land assessments, the
value would remain unchanged as the market conditions, per the taxpayers rents in comparison, as presented by the County, sustains the Assessed Value.

3505 OTISCO LN INDIANAPOLIS 46217
Petitioner submitted Appraisal contained only 1 viable comp out of 6. (4 distressed, 1 listing), among other irregularties, therefore the Appraisal's comps are
deemed invalid for use. The Appraisal does note $6k in damages to the property, this is valid. The County submitted viable comps in comparision to the subject
and made the offer of $165,100, but did not take into consideration said value of $6k in damage repair needed, so that has been applied to the presented
reduction.

Petitioner submitted comps, however those comps contained no sales values or assessed values to compare against the subject, nor did the Petitioner offer a
value different than the appealed assessed value, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. The County submitted minimal sales data that did not validate their
offer of $150k, which was declined by the Petitioner anyway. Examiner review of Assessed Values from Petitioners submitted comps and review of the Trending
ratio, supports the recommended reduction.

Minutes:
Petitioner argued the structual & land assessments. but failed to address the market conditions, therefore failing to make a prima facie case. If the Assessor
makes structual or land adjustments, further adjustments would then be made to be reflective to the market. Regardless of the structual or land assessments, the
value would remain unchanged as the market conditions, per the taxpayers rents in comparison, as presented by the County, sustains the Assessed Value.

Minutes:
Representative is arguing the year of petition. Rep wants '14, but clearly missed the dealine, Rep obtained a copy of the tax bill in October of '15, originally made
the claim this was their notice, however no bill was issued; Rep also claimed nothing was mailed in the Spring to their client, but a tax bill statement was sent out
to the property location, of which the Rep's client owns. The mailing may have had a different name on the mail, however, the Rep and client both know when
taxes are due, and failed to do their due diligence to obtain a tax bill timely, so again the Rep is clearly late in filing for '14. Examiner stance is the '14 deadline
was missed, so the petition becomes a '15, just as any other petition filed as such would be treated, no different.

Minutes:
Re-issuing to the board with previous manual AV change that was made after the petition was entered, change was not made aware or updated to Examiner by
County, before sustainment request, therefor the system (auto-fill) had the previous lesser value in place. Additionally, previous attempts by County to resolve
with Rep failed due to Rep not following through, even after additional time wa given.

701 S GIRLS SCHOOL RD INDIANAPOLIS 46231
Assessment Sustained based on the following: Petitioner Rep failed to support claims the 1996 CART/IRL Racing Series split had any direct effect on Team
Menard leaving this subject building after 2003, (what the Examiner later found to be in merger with another team in 2004), nor any relation to the 2012 (and
’13,’14 & ’15) Assessed Values. The Petitioner Rep failed to support a lesser value through comparable properties by the lack of comparable evidence,
submitting only one comp. The County supported their claims to sustain the assessment by multiple comparable properties in the subjects general area, as well
as references to previous appealed years with the same Rep, at the AV’s of $1,000,000 and $1,272,000, respectfully during 2008 through 2011.

Assessment Sustained at $998,000 based on the following: Petitioner Rep failed to support claims the 1996 CART/IRL Racing Series split had any direct effect
on Team Menard leaving this subject building after 2003, (what the Examiner later found to be in merger with another team in 2004), nor any relation to the 2013
(and ’12,’14 & ’15) Assessed Values. The Petitioner Rep failed to support a lesser value through comparable properties by the lack of comparable evidence,
submitting only one comp. The County supported their claims to sustain the assessment by multiple comparable properties in the subjects general area, as well
as references to previous appealed years with the same Rep, at the AV’s of $1,000,000 and $1,272,000, as well as future value stipulations, respectfully during
2008 through 2011, which result in the Manual AV change to $998,000
