MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES
Alcohol Gallonage Tax - Income generated from a state-imposed tax on every gallon of alcoholic
beverages sold.
Auto Excise Tax - Income derived, in lieu of personal property tax, on all motor vehicles, except those that
fall under the commercial vehicle excise tax classification.
Cable TV Franchise Fees - The City receives a percentage, currently 5%, of either the gross annual
subscriber receipts or the franchisee’s gross annual receipts, whichever is greater.
Commercial Vehicle Excise Tax – Revenue based on the weight of the vehicle and is paid at the time of
registration. The base for this tax is commercial vehicles such as tractors and trailers that were subject to
the property tax.
Financial Institutions Tax - This tax is based upon a combination of the net income and the personal
property of financial institutions.
Fuel Tax - Taxes generated from the sale of gasoline and other fuels.
General Tobacco Tax - Revenue received from the taxation of all cigarettes sold, used, consumed,
handled or distributed with the state.
Interest Income - Revenue earned as the City invests its idle funds in various investment vehicles.
Liquor Excise Tax - Income generated from the sale and renewal of liquor licenses.
Local Income Tax – Effective January 1, 2017, the Local Income Tax (LIT) will replace the former County
Option Income Tax (COIT), Local Option Income Tax (LOIT) and County Economic Development Income
Tax (CEDIT). The Local Income Tax is divided into three components: Expenditure Rate, Property Tax
Relief Rate and the Special Purpose Rate. The Special Purpose Rate is not applicable to Allen County.
The new breakout is as follows:
• Expenditure Rate – 0.9831%
o Certified Shares Distribution (formerly County Option Income Tax - .6%)
– now 0.4821%
o Public Safety Distribution (formerly Local Option Income Tax - 0.1%) –
now 0.1%
o Economic Development Distribution (formerly County Economic
Development Income Tax – 0.4%) – now 0.4%
• Property Tax Relief Rate – (formerly – 0.25%) - now 0.3679%
Municipal Surtax/Wheel Tax – Taxes generated from all registered vehicles licensed in the
City of Fort Wayne and is effective January 1, 2017.
Property Tax - The largest source of City revenues. This tax results from the tax rate applied against the
assessed value of the property.
Other sources of revenue include, but are not limited to: animal control licenses, payments in lieu of taxes,
ordinance violations, rental property, zoning fees, engineering and technical service fees, grants and other
contributions.

TAXES BASED ON INCOME
In March of 1989, the Common Council of the City of Fort Wayne enacted the County Option Income Tax (COIT), one
of three local option income taxes available to counties under State statutes in Indiana, as part of a tax reform
package. Also, available to counties under Indiana law is the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT) and the
County Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT). The Common Council controlled enactment of the tax at that
time based on the fact that the City comprised 58.5% of the population of Allen County, even though the Allen County
COIT Council actually enacts the tax.
The tax reform effort involved two primary strategies. One, it is appropriate to tax those citizens who live outside the
City but use City services such as roads and streets, fire protection, and police protection while they work in Fort
Wayne. To a modest extent, COIT accomplishes that. Two, adding a different tax base into the picture, income as
opposed to property, broadens and distributes the total tax burden in a fairer manner. COIT accomplishes that as well.
The tax reform package also included an increase in the Homestead Property Tax Credit from 4% to 12% by 1992 and
a flat property tax rate through 1992. The COIT tax began on July 1, 1989 at a rate of .2% on Indiana adjusted gross
income. Because of fluctuations in the base upon which COIT is computed, revenue could vary more from year to
year than does property tax revenue.
COIT increased to .3% on July 1, 1990, where it remained frozen until July 1, 1992. In March of 1992, the Common
Council removed a self-imposed freeze on the COIT tax and allowed it to go to .4% effective July 1, 1992. The
Common Council increased COIT to .5% effective July 1, 1993 and to .6% effective July 1, 1994. The City receives
revenues from the State of Indiana on a delayed basis.
In March of 1993, the Common Council enacted the Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) for Allen County at a
level of .2% effective July 1, 1993. Use of these funds is restricted to projects related to economic development,
infrastructure improvements, Parks and Safety capital expenditures or payment on bonds to fund any of these types of
projects. In March of 1998, Common Council voted to increase the rate to .4% effective July 1, 1998.
The Allen County Income Tax Council in June of 2013 approved a Property Tax Relief (PTR) Local Option Income Tax
(LOIT) of .25% and a Public Safety (PS) LOIT of .10%, which went into effect October 1, 2013. These LOIT’s are also
referred to as a type of COIT. The base for this tax is the same as the County Option Income Tax, individual Indiana
taxable income in Allen County.

ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL DEPARTMENT
The Department of Animal Care and Control (FWACC) faces the public health and safety issues involving animals
using a proactive approach. Protection of citizens and animals, animal rescue, and efforts to minimize euthanasia
of unwanted animals through spay/neuter promotion all strongly reflect the neighborhood and community driven
origins of this department. Local and state legislation is used to address cruelty or violence issues involving
animals, pet overpopulation, and responsible pet ownership issues. The success of the approach would not be
possible without positive community outreach and education.
The city ordinance delineates the laws to be enforced and the responsibilities of the department toward achieving
an overall professional and quality program. The ordinance is seen as a model in the country and this department
has been recognized nationally as a leader in the field, with multiple employees who have been national instructors
in specific areas of the profession. FWACC will continue to provide high levels of service in all areas and continue
enforcement aimed at the protection and assistance of both community residents and animals. We will strive to
increase promotion of responsible animal ownership to increase the safety levels in our community and to combat
pet overpopulation and its resulting euthanasia of domestic animals.
Programming and Initiatives
The first year of the Community Cat program has proven to be extremely successful with an astounding 600 cats
saved from certain euthanasia. FWACC is continuing our efforts of saving lives by having adapted the national
standard of a same day send home process for adoptions. All adoptable animals are vaccinated, sterilized, and
behaviorally assessed prior to being placed onto the adoption floor allowing for more animals to move through the
program.
Due to the volume of animals FWACC takes in, there isn’t always enough space in our adoption program so we
partner with our coalition partner, Allen County SPCA, and various rescues to place adoptable animals. We
persevere in rehoming animals into our community while still adhering to governmental responsibilities. The
efforts of partnering with other organizations allow us to continue housing pets from our community that are lost,
under quarantine, or those needing shelter as victims of cruelty, neglect, and abuse. We continue to receive the
highest volume of animals in all of northeast Indiana. The ultimate goal of the adoption program is to save lives
which we balance with our mission to ensure public health and safety.
FWACC staff utilizes every opportunity to educate citizens on proper pet care in an effort to promote responsible
pet ownership and pet retention. We are diligent with efforts to create a safe community for both citizens and
animals. Efforts to combat cruelty, neglect, and abuse is primarily handled through our enforcement division.
Animal Control Officers conduct thorough investigations utilizing their advanced training with advanced criminal
cases being reviewed and prosecuted through the Allen County Prosecutor’s Office. FWACC is fortunate to have
this relationship with the Allen County Prosecutor’s Office as many animal control agencies struggle to have their
cases presented for prosecution.
FWACC has increased their headcount for the first time in over five years to have a veterinarian on-site. The
veterinarian will perform the required sterilization of all adoptable animals as well as for our community cats.
Currently, staff transports a majority of our animals to an off-site location for the surgery to occur where a surgery
cost per animal is assessed ranging from $27-$65. There is an immediate cost savings by funding our
veterinarian per hour versus per surgery. The veterinarian will also provide rabies vaccinations to animals
impounded as stray or in the shelter for quarantine that are not current. This will eliminate the need to issue
citizens citations upon reclaim and staff and the court system for citizens who fail to comply, saving everyone
involved time and money.
FWACC will be adopting another national standard by closing the after-hours depository. More than 3,400
animals are dropped off with 62% of those without citizen or animal information. The unknown information
prevents staff from educating or providing resources to citizens to keep the animals in their home, extends
length of stay in the shelter awaiting legal holding periods before evaluation or euthanasia, and ultimately
results in creating unnecessary expenses to FWACC.
Goals and Objectives
FWACC Mission: Guided by the humane ethic and livability interests within our neighborhoods, the mission of Fort
Wayne Animal Care & Control is to ensure public health and safety as well as prevent pet overpopulation, animal
neglect, and animal cruelty through education, rescue, and law enforcement.

BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement:
The mission of Benefits Administration is to promote the health and well-being of City employees, retirees, and
their families, by providing excellent customer service through the administration of City benefits programs.
Benefits Administration is part of the Human Resources Department. This allows Benefits Administration to
partner with the Human Resources staff to promote a positive working environment and improve communications
to all City employees and departments. Benefits Administration continues to work closely with the Controller’s
Office and the Payroll Department in many aspects that are necessary to administer City benefits programs.
Goals and Objectives:
The goals for Benefits Administration are:
•

Provide excellent customer service to employees, retirees and their dependents.

•

Act as a liaison between providers, and employees and retirees, to resolve benefits issues.

•

Review benefit programs and make recommendations for change and/or improvement.

•

Maintain accurate records of employees and retirees relating to: health insurance, COBRA administration,
life insurance, long-term disability, short-term disability, flexible spending accounts, and FMLA.

•

Monitor provider billings to detect errors and contain costs.

•

Continue to maintain and develop the Flexible Spending Account program in order to save employees
and the City of Fort Wayne on taxable income. Flexible Spending Accounts are tax-favored accounts that
allow employees to set aside money pretax for eligible Medical and Dependent Care costs. Claims are
processed through the Benefits office and reimbursed on employee payroll checks bi-weekly. As an
employer, the City of Fort Wayne saves on every dollar that passes through the Flex program by reducing
its FICA liability.

•

Develop and implement wellness programs for employees, retirees and their families, to improve the
quality of life of these individuals and mitigate benefit costs, including but not limited to annual Health
Fairs, monthly wellness seminars and a Smoking Cessation Program.

•

Develop, maintain and comply with a benefits administration procedure manual.

•

Develop and maintain good working relationships with benefit providers, HR Department, Payroll
Department, Controller’s Office and departmental payroll clerks in order to foster cooperation and provide
good customer service to employees, retirees and family members.

CABLE FUND
Mission Statement:
The primary purpose of the cable fund is to enhance public, educational, and government access television
within the City of Fort Wayne, through the effective use of cable television franchise fee receipts.
1. Effectively and efficiently administer the grant program.
2. Monitor the cable provider’s compliance with the franchise agreement.
3. Respond to citizen complaints regarding cable television service and resolve any cable
television issues as quickly and equitably as possible.
General Information:
60% of the franchise fee revenues collected by Comcast Cablevision and Frontier Communications are
deposited directly into the General Fund. The remaining 40% are applied to the Cable Fund, and their use is
detailed below.
In the previous four quarters ending June 30, 2016, $1,670,000.92 was disbursed to the General Fund and
$1,113,333.95 was disbursed to the Cable Fund.
Franchise fee based disbursements from the Cable Fund are allocated based on a formula, as established
by ordinance G-27-95.
The Cable Fund supports these programs:
Access Originator grants: General ordinance G-27-95 stipulates that 80% of the cable franchise
fees receipted to the Cable Fund be disbursed, as recommended by the Cable Fund Access Board,
to the four access channel originators in our community. Those originators are college access
television, operated by Indiana University/Purdue University; public access, operated by the Allen
County Public Library; government access, managed by the City of Fort Wayne with daily operations
subcontracted to the Allen County Public Library; and educational access, operated by Fort Wayne
Community Schools.
Access Originator Grants are disbursed quarterly. In the four quarters ending June 30 2016, each
access originator received $222,666.79, for a total of $890,667.16. The 2017 program (166ACTR)
budget is $930,000.
The amount budgeted does not affect the amount granted, as the amount granted is set by
ordinance as a fixed percentage of franchise fee revenue. To avoid revising the budget, the amount
budgeted should be safely above the last years revenue receipts.
Non-access originator grants: G-27-95 also specifies that 10% of franchise fees receipted to the
Cable Fund be available as grants to not-for-profit organizations located within Fort Wayne that do
not originate an access station, for the purpose of enhancing local access. These grants are used to
improve local access television and enhance public access. Per ordinance, these grants can be
used to reimburse personnel expenses, overhead costs, production costs, operation expenses, and
equipment expenses. For 2017, $115,000 has been budgeted (166NFPG) for these grants.
City administrative expenses: The remaining 10% of franchise fees receipted to the Cable Fund
are used to offset administrative expenses related to the grant program, cable television franchising
issues, and information dissemination. For 2017, $51,000 has been budgeted in contracted
services: $20,000 for closed captioning and $31,000 related to information dissemination, supplies,
advertising, copy costs, hardware and software. An operating transfer of $312,000 has been
budgeted to reimburse the General Fund salary expenses associated with the Cable Franchise and
Cable Board, the processing the purchase orders relating to grant awards, and general accounting
functions related to the Cable Fund.

Consolidated Communications Partnership
SHERIFF DAVID GLADIEUX COMMISSIONER NELSON PETERS

POLICE CHIEF STEVE REED FIRE CHIEF ERIC LAHEY

The Consolidated Communications Partnership (CCP) is the line between citizens and public safety
personnel. We are committed to developing a partnership with the community and the agencies we serve.
We are aware of the roles we play and strive to provide quality, efficient, accurate information, and superior
service to ensure the safety of both the community and public safety personnel. We continually strive for
professionalism, dedication and service to the community with each task we are assigned.
911 Center Goals
•

Provide immediate, accurate and professional service in Police, Fire and Medical emergencies
to the citizens of Fort Wayne/Allen County.

•

Provide efficient, accurate and professional assistance to Public Safety and Public Service
personnel so that they may deliver the most effective responses to the needs of the citizens of
Fort Wayne/Allen County.

•

Maintain hardware and software for our employees so that they may continue to provide the
highest possible standard of service to the citizens of Fort Wayne/Allen County.

•

Meet and exceed training standards as set by APCO, Priority Dispatch.

2016 has been a very interesting and difficult year for the CCP. With the resignation of the director, to the
announcement of an interim director, to the process of hiring a new full time director the CCP has been an
organization in flux. The CCP has also survived the separation of several employees which created an
extraordinary amount of overtime and stress. Through the adversity the CCP employees have continued to
handle their responsibilities in an exemplary manner.
The CCP has continued with its community involvement and assistance by participating in local events
including the Fort Wayne Air Show, the Luke Bryan concert and the Three Rivers Festival, along with many
other community events.
In 2016 the CCP has worked to improve the phone system’s capabilities which will enhance their ability to
respond to our citizen’s needs. The CCP’s recent response to the two tornadoes that went through Allen
County in August is a perfect example of the dedication and professionalism of these faithful employees.
The CCP will continue to work with outside agencies to make sure we are providing the best possible
service not only to our first responders but to all the citizens who live, work, or are just passing through Fort
Wayne and Allen County. The CCP is proud to serve as one of the four emergency service agencies to
serve our great community.

INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement:
Internal Audit is committed to the systematic, objective appraisal of diverse operations and controls throughout the
City and Utilities to determine that:
• financial and operating information is accurate and reliable,
• risks are identified and appropriately managed,
• regulations, laws, policies and procedures are followed,
• satisfactory standards are met, and
• resources are used efficiently and economically to achieve the City’s objectives.
Services provided to the Utilities are quantified and reimbursed to the City to offset a portion of our budget, which
has averaged 32.6% of the budget for the past three years. We estimate the 2017 recovery at 36.5% based on
the anticipated audit coverage established in the long-term audit plan. This estimate represents $108,793 of the
budget presented.
Goals and Objectives:
-

Utilize a structured risk assessment methodology that quantifies risk throughout the organization, and
develop an audit schedule that promotes the review of operations based on the risk scores calculated.

-

Present accurate, comprehensive reports that sufficiently cover the scope and objectives of the audit work
performed within the budgeted time frame.

-

Provide sufficient follow-up assessments on prior audit comments to assess progress in relation to
recommendations. This process enables us to determine whether the adjustments made effectively
address the original concerns.

-

Conduct consultative services throughout the City which includes assessments of current processes or
process changes, responding to questions posed by management, conducting investigative or analytic
services when necessary or requested.

-

Establish and maintain positive working relationships with management throughout the audit process and
ensure management is well informed. We maintain a “no surprises” approach to each project.

-

Provide a comprehensive continuing professional education program for audit personnel to maintain the
knowledge and skills necessary to satisfactorily perform assigned audits and stay abreast of new audit
tools and techniques.

-

Secure an independent review of the department performance (peer review) at a minimum of once every
three years. This review will address the quality of work performed, the department's compliance with its
objectives and audit standards and the effect the department has had upon the City.

Quantification of Services:
When considering audit and consultative services reported and or completed between January 1, and June 30,
2016, we have identified the following:
•

METROPOLITAN HUMAN RELATIONS
The Metropolitan Human Relations Commission (“MHRC”) was established in 1952 by the Common Council of Fort
Wayne to “administer and enforce” anti-discrimination legislation within the territorial boundaries of the City of Fort
Wayne. As primary basis for establishing MHRC, the Mayor and Common Council decreed the following:
“Discrimination in social, cultural and economic life in Fort Wayne against any person or persons because of race, sex,
color, religion, handicap, ancestry, national origin, or place of birth, is contrary to American principles and is harmful to
the social, cultural, and economic life of the city. Discrimination, particularly in employment opportunities, public
accommodations and housing, increases the burden and cost of government; and, such discrimination contributes to
increased crime, vice, juvenile delinquency, fires and other evils thereby affecting the public safety, public health, and
general welfare of the community. It is therefore deemed to be in the best interests of the city to create a metropolitan
Commission to administer and enforce anti-discrimination legislation and ordinances, all as authorized by the Indiana
Civil Rights Act.”
The Commission continues to maintain a high level of productivity in case resolutions, reducing case age in the office,
and implementing stringent case processing protocols to ensure timely resolution of cases. MHRC has set measurable
goals to increase quality of compliance with the regulations of its federal partners, the United States Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and the United States Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). MHRC’s
contractual commitment continues to increase. This continuing increase translates to increased revenue from EEOC
and HUD, thereby reducing the Commission’s reliance on property tax dollars.
VISION STATEMENT
MHRC is focused on, and committed to creating an environment in the City of Fort Wayne that will produce an
inclusive community where trust, acceptance, fairness and equality are the City’s norms. To achieve this vision, the
Commission will be fair, impartial and thorough in assertively enforcing the law, and aggressive in promoting
community outreach and training initiatives.

- 86 -

GOALS
I.

To continue to expeditiously investigate all credible allegations and/or conditions that create or promote
adverse effects on persons and/or sections of the City, or conditions and/or allegations that result in a
discriminatory treatment of persons and/or sections of the City on the bases enumerated in Ordinance G21-78.

II.

To expand outreach activities, especially in housing and public accommodation, to schools and colleges
within the territorial boundaries of the City of Fort Wayne. This will include continued partnering with
lending institutions and housing providers to promote fair housing and fair lending practices.

III.

To advertise MHRC’s educational programs and activities to surrounding localities that do not have MHRC
type entity in order to create additional revenue generating scheme for the Commission.

IV.

To expand outreach to local businesses and smaller employers, to aid them in training on civil rights
issues, and provide support and encourage policies which promote and foster fair employment and equal
opportunity for Fort Wayne citizens.

V.

To provide channels of communication among various racial, religious and ethnic groups in the City.

VI.

To provide community mediation services to assist with inter-group conflicts.

VII.

To develop Commission employees into first-rate fair, impartial, and thorough civil rights workers.

VIII.

To expand MHRC’s grant writing activities to seek resources that will enable MHRC to partner and share
those resources with local organizations that provide human relations type services to residents of the City
in the areas of housing, employment, and education, etc.

IX.

To expand the Commission’s alternative dispute resolution program (mediation and conciliation). This
may even include securing outside mediators to assist in mediating and conciliating cases pending before
the Commission.

X.

To actively work with departments of local governments so as to utilize whatever existing programs,
equipment, or personnel they may have and can share in order to help avoid duplicity/redundancy/ and
cost in operations.

XI.

To coordinate regionally and state-wide with other similarly situated local civil rights enforcement agencies
to gain expertise, foster relationships, gain efficiencies of scale and promote sharing of best practices and
resources to further aid in supporting the mission of MHRC to the local community.

XII.

To ensure that the Commission secures the necessary tools needed to enable it to provide services that
are packaged in professionalism but not at the expense of cost effectiveness.

to approximately 76,000 residents. The Northeast quadrant has increased its retail development in the
Georgetown Business District, along with the opening of the Maplecrest Road Bridge Extension. Although,
crime has been traditionally low in the Northeast Division, changes in the population and demographics
have resulted in an increase of criminal activity in certain neighborhoods and apartment complexes. A
focus has been placed in the areas of thefts from vehicles and residential burglaries. The Division

entertainment venues were moved from the Southwest quadrant to the Southeast responsibility. This was
done to provide increase continuity of information, service and patrol strategies. Although, the population
and the square miles patrolled by the Southeast Division are smaller than the other quadrants, the calls for
service within the Southeast Division remain the highest of all four quadrants.

2017 GOALS
nd

In the year 2016 the Police Department will hire 10 Lateral Officers, we also began the process for the 62
Recruit Class that will start the Academy in January of 2017. The goal is to maintain our full allotted
strength of 460 Officers, with the majority of the new Officers serving in our Operations Division giving our
Quadrant Commanders more resources to combat crime and to proactively serve the residents of Fort
Wayne.
In 2016 we will create the Community Relations Unit and look to expand that Unit in 2017. The purpose of
this Division would be to enhance the relationship between the FWPD and the community by use of liaison
officers, social media, public media, and community outreach.
We will look to expand our use of Crime analysis to locate concentrations of crime, the types of crime being
committed, and other information, that will help craft the most effective response. We will also enhance
intelligence gathering so we can focus our resources on known violent offenders.

As always, we will continue to monitor and respond to the ever-changing public safety and quality-of-life
issues throughout the city. We will provide our employees with a variety of training opportunities that will
maintain their various technical certifications and increase our overall ability to meet the community’s
expectations on a daily basis. We will continue to educate the public about criminal activity within their
neighborhoods and provide on-going assistance on how they can reduce their chance of being victimized.

POLICE PENSION
The mission of the Board of Pension Trustees is outlined in Indiana Statutes found in: IC 36-8-6 for the
1925 fund, IC 36-8-8 for the 1977 fund, and IC 38-8-8.5 for the Deferred Option Retirement Programs
(DROP) and Partial Lump Sum Distribution found in 36.8.8.24.8.
The trustees are charged with the fiduciary responsibility of overseeing payments of 1925 Act pension
funds, the operation of the office of the pension secretary and the evaluation of potential officers for
membership in the 1977 Act fund. The local board also evaluates applications for disability from the 1977
Act and makes recommendations to the Indiana Public Retirement System (Public Employees Retirement
Fund) regarding such applications.
Members:
Mayor Thomas C. Henry
Controller Len Poehler
Chief Steve Reed

Scott Caudill
Kevin Hunter
Casey Furge

Ronald L. Buskirk (Ret.)
Sonia Atienzo
Zack Carter

There are nine members of the Board of Trustees. Three are members by virtue of office, the Mayor,
Controller and Police Chief. Of the remaining six members, five are elected representatives of the active
membership of police department and one additional member, a retired officer, is elected. The Trustees
have staggered three year terms. The Board of Police Pension Trustees meets monthly on the second
Tuesday of each month taking action as required. Special sessions are called for hearings and hiring
reviews.
A member of the board is selected annually to serve as the secretary and is responsible for all payments,
collections, and communications with the benefit recipients. In addition, the secretary is the keeper of the
records of the Fort Wayne Police Pension Fund and as such, is required to communicate with all other
entities, which may choose to correspond with the board.
The laws regarding police officers’ pensions are provided by statute and changes do occur from time to
time. It is necessary for the trustees to be aware of these mandated changes. It is the responsibility of
the secretary to keep all trustees informed of such changes.
It is the responsibility of the board to adopt an annual budget for submission for adoption within the civil
city budget. Since the submitted budget of the pension fund cannot, by Indiana Statute, be reduced, it is
essential that the trustees be extremely cautious when forecasting the funding necessary to meet the
needs of the board to carry out the directions of the laws.

FLOOD CONTROL DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement
The mission of the Flood Control Department is to ensure that property damage due to flooding is
minimal by the continual monitoring of the early flood warning system and ensuring that it is
operational; upgrading our flood fighting strategies; maintaining our 12 plus miles of flood protection
structures; and buying properties in the floodplain mitigating flood damages and creating storage for
flood waters.

Goals and Objectives
•

Fort Wayne/Allen County Flood Control Project
As our flood control structures age; withstand significant flooding; and complying with the
Army Corps of Engineers more rigid standards, keeping maintenance costs at a minimum will
be a challenge in the coming years. Our department has and will continue to use smaller
experienced contractors to repair/rehabilitate the flood control structures. This will allow us to
effectively preserve and maintain our structures for the protection of Fort Wayne residents
and keep maintenance costs at a minimum.

•

Federal Grants
Flood Control continues to oversee the administration of approved federal grants to acquire
and demolish residential and commercial properties and remove them from the
floodplain/floodway. Flood Control is continues to acquiring properties in the Junk Ditch and
St. Mary’s River area. We are always looking for federal funding opportunities to continue
these buyouts.

- 107 -

•

Upgraded Early Flood Warning System
The Flood Control Department expanded its early flood warning system from 16 to 32
sites. The data from this system is critical to the National Weather Service for flood watches,
warnings and crest predictions during a flood. This system was designed to be used by other
City Departments, outside agencies and smaller communities in this area. Flood Control has
budgeted to maintain the 32 sites to continue communicating as designed and for additional
sensors to be added to the system for its expanded use.

STREET LIGHT OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement
Street Light Operations is responsible for providing sufficient illumination to aid in safe and efficient
movement of pedestrian and motorized traffic during the evening and night time hours, using the
latest technology in design, installation and maintenance.

Goals and Objectives
•

•

To design, construct and maintain the existing street lighting facilities for the citizens of Fort
Wayne.
Continue pole identification program by installing tags on all street lighting facilities to aid in

work processes and inventory.
Replacement of concrete lighting poles in areas where we have noted deterioration.
Incorporate enhanced high pressure sodium lamps, in areas with older (15 years or more)
lighting fixtures.
Continue to find ways to decrease energy consumption by use of new technology. LED
lighting is on the forefront as we attempt to reach this goal.

RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT

Risk Management identifies, assesses, and prioritizes the various risks within the operation of the City with the
clear goal of loss prevention. We utilize the internal and external resources available to us to minimize, monitor,
control and ideally, to prevent loss. This includes legal liabilities which come in the form of tort claims against the
City, Workers Compensation and Hurt on Duty claims by injured workers, and assuring adequate insurance
coverage for all City assets and general liability and police professional claims.
The City of Fort Wayne has been self-insured for General, Auto, and Police Professional Liabilities since an
ordinance was passed in 1989 establishing the self-insurance fund. Then in 1991, an additional ordinance was
passed establishing the Workers Compensation Fund. All costs for the operating budget of Risk Management,
actuarial costs to maintain proper funding for the General Fund, third party expenses for Workers Compensation
claims processing and loss control are from the fund.
The five-person team includes two Safety Claims Investigators to attend motor vehicle accidents involving City
employees and to perform inspections and investigations to assure OSHA compliance. Members of the team
monitor and maintain the tort claim process, the City’s drug screening process, safety training of City employees,
handling of Workers Comp and Hurt on Duty injuries, as well as maintaining records of employees training,
physicals (CDL, Confined Space, Post Offer and Workability exams) and immunizations. We also participate in
interdepartmental groups such as FMLA and insurance committees, and ADA Coordinator duties. This continual
monitoring and management for these functions in all City departments provides excellent stewardship of
taxpayers’ money.

STREET DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement
The primary mission of the Street Department is to provide the citizens of Fort Wayne with a wellmaintained and safe transportation infrastructure. We strive to render cost effective, competent service
including snow removal, street resurfacing, leaf pick-up, street sweeping and overall street maintenance.
Goals and Objectives
Pothole response time remains a top priority for the department, maintaining an average response time of
less than three hours. We now also incorporate four heated asphalt trailers that we use throughout the
city. These allow us to keep our asphalt hot throughout the day, regardless of the temperature outside,
giving us much higher efficiency with respect to the “shelf life” of the material, as well as our response
time. They are also excellent for “cold mix” in the winter months, making the material much more pliable in
extreme temperatures for better applications, increasing patch durability.
Our seven week leaf program is working well and we are again prepared to collect more than 4,000
truckloads or, roughly 14,000 tons of leaves this year. We will also collect all bagged leaves reported to
the 311 call center within 2 business days.
Throughout the winter season, we maintain and clear the city streets of snow and ice to ensure safe
travel for motorists.
During our construction season, paving and chip and seal resurfacing along with crack sealing streets
remain top priorities. In 2016 we plan to pave 12 miles, complete 10 miles of chip and seal resurfacing
and 75 miles crack seal streets which preserves the city streets paving investment. We also provide
several other city services such as street sweeping, alley and berm maintenance and right of way
mowing.
Also, we maintain the majority of the Fort Wayne Trails system. We provide for the cutback of vegetation
and trees, garbage removal, grass cutting, carpentry work on bridges and decks, repaving, and trail
rebuilding as required by floods whenever necessary. Our goal is to ensure the safety and enjoyment of
all who utilize the trails whether they walk, run, or ride their bicycles.

TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING SERVICES
Street Project Management Department
Mission Statement
Street Project Management is a department within the Division of Public Works, Transportation Engineering
section. The mission of the Street Project Management Department is to plan, design and implement the
construction and repair of a safe and efficient transportation system within the City of Fort Wayne.
The City Engineer directs the Street Project Management section of Transportation Engineering. The duty of
the City Engineer is to oversee the preparation of plans and specifications for the competitive bidding of
Capital Improvement Programs, Public Works Maintenance projects requiring engineering expertise and all
other improvement projects necessary for the safe, efficient and economical operation of the Public Works
Division of the City of Fort Wayne government.
Goals and Objectives
•

Plan, design, and construct neighborhood projects in the year they are planned for construction.

It’s important to fulfill commitments for street, curb and walk improvements in the year those commitments
were made. This will be accomplished by beginning the design process earlier once projects have been
selected. This goal will strengthen our customer’s confidence in our services. Our customers are the citizens
of Fort Wayne and their designated government representatives.
•

Maintain and update the Pavement Management System.

Keeping this database up to date will ensure we are concentrating on the infrastructure that needs the most
attention. The Pavement Management System will also help determine from year to year how well we are
accomplishing our goals and whether those goals should be re-evaluated. We update our system by
reassessing at least 1/3 of our total miles each year.
This system is our tracking device to measure our success in improving the pavement condition citywide. The
overall system condition in 2015 was rated in the “Good” condition category.
Our customers; the engineers, planners, government representatives, and the citizens of Fort Wayne, are
important to us and together we depend on this information to make sound decisions about Transportation
projects. Street Project management will
•
•

Assist the Street Maintenance Department in our calculated goal of asphalt resurfacing of 52 miles
of asphalt roads and streets through contracted services.
Repair or reconstruct in our calculated goal of 10 miles of concrete streets through contracted
services.

It’s imperative to keep up with the pace of deterioration our infrastructure experiences each year. We have
determined these are miles of pavement that must be improved upon to keep the overall system condition in
the “Good” condition level. To meet our established goals, appropriate funding must be dedicated
towards transportation related infrastructure.
If we can provide a well-maintained transportation system, businesses will be attracted to Fort Wayne and
ultimately create new jobs. A well maintained system will also reduce our liability from accidents stemming
from poor pavement condition. Our customers are the citizens of Fort Wayne who expect a safe and reliable
transportation system.

- 123 -

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES DEPARTMENT
It is the mission of the Department of Weights & Measures to ensure equity in the marketplace for both
merchants and consumers. The department is responsible for the testing and inspection of all commercial
weighing and measuring devices, enforcing the City Ordinance regarding taxicab operations, enforcing the City
Weights and Measures Ordinance, and enforcing State Codes governing Weights and Measures.
The principal duty of our department is to test, certify, and seal correct devices; or order correction, condemn
and confiscate faulty devices or commodities offered for sale by weight or count.
In our 2015-2016 reporting year, 21,680 inspections were performed.

2017 Goals:
1) The primary goal for Weights & Measures is to continue our efforts of ensuring equity in the
marketplace. The importance of ensuring the accuracy of weighing and measuring devices can best be
illustrated by example:
•
•

A Deli scale that weighs 1 oz. over or under weight (with an assumed average of 100 purchases per
day @ $2.00 per pound) will result in a $4,500+ annual loss for the business or their customers.
A single gasoline pump that delivers 5 cubic inches (about 5 tablespoons) per gallon over or under
volume (with assumed average sales) can result in a $5,000+ annual loss for the business or their
customers.

2) To ensure continuing commitment to our primary goal, and in a culture of ever evolving standards and
devices, currency in training must be maintained. Correct, consistent, and fair enforcement of weights
and measures laws require both initial and continuing education of inspectors. Therefore, it is our goal
to use every opportunity to seek out cost effective training. and utilize the course materials available to
us through our membership in the National Conference of Weights and Measures.

Services Provided:
•
•
•
•
•

Inspect all commercial weighing and measuring devices within the City, such as vehicle and computing
scales, gasoline pumps, taximeters, commercial and prescription scales.
Inspect packaged goods sold within the City by weight, measure, or count, or marked for weight, measure,
or count.
Enforce state codes and city ordinances that apply to weights and measures.
Order correction of, or condemn, or confiscate faulty devices or commodities that are sold by weight,
measure, or count.
Prepare monthly and annual reports for the Fire Chief, Board of Public Safety, and the State Weights and
Measures Division.

MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES
Alcohol Gallonage Tax - Income generated from a state-imposed tax on every gallon of alcoholic
beverages sold.
Auto Excise Tax - Income derived, in lieu of personal property tax, on all motor vehicles, except those that
fall under the commercial vehicle excise tax classification.
Cable TV Franchise Fees - The City receives a percentage, currently 5%, of either the gross annual
subscriber receipts or the franchisee’s gross annual receipts, whichever is greater.
Commercial Vehicle Excise Tax – Revenue based on the weight of the vehicle and is paid at the time of
registration. The base for this tax is commercial vehicles such as tractors and trailers that were subject to
the property tax.
County Option Income Tax - Revenue generated from the income of those persons working within Allen
County. This tax is at a level of .6% effective July 1, 1994.
Local Option Income Tax – The base for this tax is the same as the County Option Income Tax, individual
Indiana taxable income in Allen County. The Allen County Income Tax Council in June of 2013 approved a
Property Tax Relief (PTR) LOIT of .25% and a Public Safety (PS) LOIT of .10% which will be effective
October 1, 2013. These LOIT’s are also referred to as a type of COIT.
Economic Development Income Tax - The base for this tax is the same as the County Option Income
Tax, individual Indiana taxable income in Allen County. This tax is at a level of .4% effective July 1, 1998.
Financial Institutions Tax - This tax is based upon a combination of the net income and the personal
property of financial institutions.
Fuel Tax - Taxes generated from the sale of gasoline and other fuels.
General Tobacco Tax - Revenue received from the taxation of all cigarettes sold, used, consumed,
handled or distributed with the state.
Interest Income - Revenue earned as the City invests its idle funds in various investment vehicles.
Liquor Excise Tax - Income generated from the sale and renewal of liquor licenses.
Property Tax - The largest source of City revenues. This tax results from the tax rate applied against the
assessed value of the property.
Other sources of revenue include, but are not limited to: animal control licenses, payments in lieu of taxes,
ordinance violations, rental property, zoning fees, engineering and technical service fees, grants and other
contributions.

TAXES BASED ON INCOME
In March of 1989, the Common Council of the City of Fort Wayne enacted the County Option Income Tax (COIT), one
of three local option income taxes available to counties under State statutes in Indiana, as part of a tax reform
package. Also, available to counties under Indiana law is the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT) and the
County Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT). The Common Council controlled enactment of the tax at that
time based on the fact that the City comprised 58.5% of the population of Allen County, even though the Allen County
COIT Council actually enacts the tax.
The tax reform effort involved two primary strategies. One, it is appropriate to tax those citizens who live outside the
City but use City services such as roads and streets, fire protection, and police protection while they work in Fort
Wayne. To a modest extent, COIT accomplishes that. Two, adding a different tax base into the picture, income as
opposed to property, broadens and distributes the total tax burden in a fairer manner. COIT accomplishes that as well.
The tax reform package also included an increase in the Homestead Property Tax Credit from 4% to 12% by 1992 and
a flat property tax rate through 1992. The COIT tax began on July 1, 1989 at a rate of .2% on Indiana adjusted gross
income. Because of fluctuations in the base upon which COIT is computed, revenue could vary more from year to year
than does property tax revenue.
COIT increased to .3% on July 1, 1990, where it remained frozen until July 1, 1992. In March of 1992, the Common
Council removed a self-imposed freeze on the COIT tax and allowed it to go to .4% effective July 1, 1992. The
Common Council increased COIT to .5% effective July 1, 1993 and to .6% effective July 1, 1994. The City receives
revenues from the State of Indiana on a delayed basis.
In March of 1993, the Common Council enacted the Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) for Allen County at a
level of .2% effective July 1, 1993. Use of these funds is restricted to projects related to economic development,
infrastructure improvements, Parks and Safety capital expenditures or payment on bonds to fund any of these types of
projects. In March of 1998, Common Council voted to increase the rate to .4% effective July 1, 1998.
The Allen County Income Tax Council in June of 2013 approved a Property Tax Relief (PTR) Local Option Income Tax
(LOIT) of .25% and a Public Safety (PS) LOIT of .10%, which went into effect October 1, 2013. These LOIT’s are also
referred to as a type of COIT. The base for this tax is the same as the County Option Income Tax, individual Indiana
taxable income in Allen County.

ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL DEPARTMENT
The Department of Animal Care and Control faces the public health and safety issues involving animals using a
proactive approach. Protection of citizens and animals, animal rescue, and efforts to minimize euthanasia of unwanted
animals through spay/neuter promotion all strongly reflect the neighborhood and community driven origins of this
department. Local and state legislation is used to address cruelty or violence issues involving animals, pet
overpopulation, and responsible pet ownership issues. The success of the approach would not be possible without
positive community outreach and education.
The city ordinance delineates the laws to be enforced and the responsibilities of the department toward achieving an
overall professional and quality program. The ordinance is seen as a model in the country and this department has
been recognized nationally as a leader in the field, with multiple employees who have been national instructors in
specific areas of the profession. Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control (FWACC) will continue to provide high levels of
service in all areas and continue enforcement aimed at the protection and assistance of both community residents and
animals. We will strive to increase promotion of responsible animal ownership to increase the safety levels in our
community and to combat pet overpopulation and its resulting euthanasia of domestic animals.
Programming and Initiatives
Over the past year a coalition, which consists of the Allen County SPCA, HOPE for Animals, and FWACC, has begun
to see positive effects from the implementation of the Community Cat program. The goal of the program was to
ultimately reduce euthanasia of unwanted or unowned cats left to overpopulate our neighborhoods. With the advent of
the program, FWACC’s live release rate of cats has doubled. Without the coalition and additional funding provided by
national grant opportunities, FWACC’s euthanasia rate would have continued to rise as the cat population increased.
FWACC is ecstatic about the success of this program and we are grateful for the opportunity to work with these
agencies.
Though employee count and hours have not increased, we continue to pursue opportunities to increase adoption rates.
Through grant opportunities, transferring to other local non-profits, as well as internal programming, we persevere in
rehoming animals into our community while still adhering to governmental responsibilities. The efforts of partnering
with other organizations allow us to continue housing pets from our community that are lost, under quarantine, or those
needing shelter as victims of cruelty, neglect, and abuse. We continue to receive the highest volume of animals in all
of northeast Indiana. Prior to releasing animals into the adoption program, we ensure the animals are safe to return to
our community. The ultimate goal of the adoption program is to save lives which we balance with our mission to
ensure public health and safety.
Efforts to combat cruelty, neglect, and abuse is primarily handled through our enforcement division. Animal Control
Officers continue to conduct thorough investigations utilizing their advanced training with advanced criminal cases
being reviewed and prosecuted through the Allen County Prosecutor’s Office. FWACC is fortunate to have this
relationship with the Allen County Prosecutor’s Office as many animal control agencies struggle to have their cases
presented for prosecution. FWACC staff utilizes every opportunity to educate citizens on proper pet care in an effort to
promote responsible pet ownership. We are diligent with efforts to create a safe community for both citizens and
animals.
This budget reflects a maintenance approach to our current programming that recognizes the fiscal constraints we all
face at this time. The coalition partnerships will continue to bring additional opportunities and financing to continue to
increase live release rates and ultimately reduce euthanasia. FWACC has not increased staff or hours over the last
four years in spite of rising costs of vendor and service providers. We will continue to actively pursue creative and
collaborative efforts to maintain a safe community along with lifesaving avenues for animals.
Goals and Objectives
FWACC Mission: Guided by the humane ethic and livability interests within our neighborhoods, the mission of Fort
Wayne Animal Care & Control is to ensure public health and safety as well as prevent pet overpopulation, animal
neglect, and animal cruelty through education, rescue, and law enforcement.
1. To protect both citizens and animals using modern ordinances and state laws to reach compliance when
necessary. To aggressively pursue advanced cases of animal cruelty, neglect, and abuse.
2. To encourage responsible pet ownership and to reduce the number of unwanted domestic animals in Fort

euthanized.
3. To increase the volume of spayed and neutered animals, thus reducing animal related problems at the

44

neighborhood level, indiscriminate breeding of animals in the city, and euthanasia.
4. To increase education levels of both children and adults relative to safety, humane care and treatment of
animals, responsible pet ownership and the plight of unwanted animals.
5. To continue promotion of all local available opportunities for families unable to afford spay or neuter surgery
for their pet.
6. To increase contacts with owners regarding proper identification and registration of their pets for safe return
and to increase the volume of pets returned directly to their homes in the field.

BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement:
The mission of Benefits Administration is to promote the health and well-being of City employees, retirees, and
their families, by providing excellent customer service through the administration of City benefits programs.
Benefits Administration is part of the Human Resources Department. This allows Benefits Administration to
partner with the Human Resources staff to promote a positive working environment and improve communications
to all City employees and departments. Benefits Administration continues to work closely with the Controller’s
Office and the Payroll Department in many aspects that are necessary to administer City benefits programs.
Goals and Objectives:
The goals for Benefits Administration are:


Provide excellent customer service to employees, retirees and their dependents.



Act as a liaison between providers, and employees and retirees, to resolve benefits issues.



Review benefit programs and make recommendations for change and/or improvement.



Maintain accurate records of employees and retirees relating to: health insurance, COBRA administration,
life insurance, long-term disability, short-term disability, flexible spending accounts, and FMLA.



Monitor provider billings to detect errors and contain costs.



Continue to maintain and develop the Flexible Spending Account program in order to save employees
and the City of Fort Wayne on taxable income. Flexible Spending Accounts are tax-favored accounts that
allow employees to set aside money pretax for eligible Medical and Dependent Care costs. Claims are
processed through the Benefits office and reimbursed on employee payroll checks bi-weekly. As an
employer, the City of Fort Wayne saves on every dollar that passes through the Flex program by reducing
its FICA liability.



Develop and implement wellness programs for employees, retirees and their families, to improve the
quality of life of these individuals and mitigate benefit costs, including but not limited to annual Health
Fairs, monthly wellness seminars and a Smoking Cessation Program.



Develop, maintain and comply with a benefits administration procedure manual.



Develop and maintain good working relationships with benefit providers, HR Department, Payroll
Department, Controller’s Office and departmental payroll clerks in order to foster cooperation and provide
good customer service to employees, retirees and family members.

CABLE FUND
Mission Statement:
The primary purpose of the cable fund is to enhance public, educational, and government access television within
the City of Fort Wayne, through the effective use of cable television franchise fee receipts.
1. Effectively and efficiently administer the grant program.
2. Monitor the cable provider’s compliance with the franchise agreement.
3. Respond to citizen complaints regarding cable television service and resolve any cable television
issues as quickly and equitably as possible.
General Information:
60% of the franchise fee revenues collected by Comcast Cablevision and Frontier Communications are deposited
directly into the General Fund. The remaining 40% are applied to the Cable Fund, and their use is detailed below.
In the previous four quarters ending June 30, 2015, $1,720,966.03 was disbursed to the General Fund and
$1,147,310.68 was disbursed to the Cable Fund.
On Feb 4, 2014, the City contracted Lewis and Associates of Cooper City, Florida to audit the Cable Franchise
payments over the past 5 years. The audit completed in February 2015 and resulted in a settlement of $426,935
to the City.
This settlement is addition to the money normally disbursed to the City. The settlement was distributed as per city
ordinance with $256,161.00 (60%) to the City’s General Fund, and $170,774 (%40) to the Cable Fund.
Franchise fee based disbursements from the Cable Fund are allocated based on a formula, as established by
ordinance G-27-95.
The Cable Fund supports these programs:
Access Originator grants: General ordinance G-27-95 stipulates that 80% of the cable franchise fees
receipted to the Cable Fund be disbursed, as recommended by the Cable Fund Access Board, to the four
access channel originators in our community. Those originators are college access television, operated
by Indiana University/Purdue University; public access, operated by the Allen County Public Library;
government access, managed by the City of Fort Wayne with daily operations subcontracted to the Allen
County Public Library; and educational access, operated by Fort Wayne Community Schools.
Access Originator Grants are disbursed quarterly. In the four quarters ending June 30 2015, each access
originator received $229,462.14, for a total of $917,848.56. The 2016 program (166ACTR) budget is
$930,000.
The amount budgeted does not affect the amount granted, as the amount granted is set by ordinance as
a fixed percentage of franchise fee revenue. To avoid revising the budget, the amount budgeted should
be safely above the last years revenue receipts.
Non-access originator grants: G-27-95 also specifies that 10% of franchise fees receipted to the Cable
Fund be available as grants to not-for-profit organizations located within Fort Wayne that do not originate
an access station, for the purpose of enhancing local access. These grants are used to improve local
access television and enhance public access. Per ordinance, these grants can be used to reimburse
personnel expenses, overhead costs, production costs, operation expenses, and equipment expenses.
For 2016, $132,000 has been budgeted (166NFPG) for these grants. The increase reflects higher
receipts from franchise holders and the audit settlement.
City administrative expenses: The remaining 10% of franchise fees receipted to the Cable Fund are
used to offset administrative expenses related to the grant program, cable television franchising issues,
and information dissemination. For 2016, $60,000 has been budgeted in contracted services: $20,000 for
closed captioning and another $40,000 related to information dissemination, supplies, advertising, copy
costs, hardware and software. An operating transfer of $142,000 has been budgeted to reimburse the
General Fund salary expenses associated with the Cable Franchise and Cable Board, the processing the
purchase orders relating to grant awards, and general accounting functions related to the Cable Fund.
Total program expenses are anticipated to be $197,000 dollars.

Consolidated Communications Partnership
SHERIFF DAVID GLADIEUX COMMISSIONER NELSON PETERS

POLICE CHIEF GARRY HAMILTON FIRE CHIEF ERIC LAHEY

The Consolidated Communications Partnership (CCP) is the line between citizens and public safety
personnel. We are committed to developing a partnership with the community and the agencies we serve.
We are aware of the roles we play and strive to provide quality, efficient, accurate information, and superior
service to ensure the safety of both the community and public safety personnel. We continually strive for
professionalism, dedication and service to the community with each task we are assigned.
911 Center Goals


Provide immediate, accurate and professional service in Police, Fire and Medical emergencies to
the citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County.



Provide efficient, accurate and professional assistance to Public Safety and Public Service
personnel so that they may deliver the most effective responses to the needs of the citizens of Fort
Wayne / Allen County.



Maintain hardware and software for our employees so that they may continue to provide the highest
possible standard of service to the citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County.



Meet and exceed training standards as set by APCO, Priority Dispatch.

2015 is proving to be another exciting year for the Consolidated Communications Partnership. We have
ventured out of our comfort zone and started becoming more involved in community events. 2015 was the
first year the CCP has been involved in the Three Rivers Festival Parade with more than expected
participation. We assisted the Fort Wayne Fire Department with their week long Fire Camp. With more
than a year of planning between TRAA and the CCP, both agencies are now working in the same center.
We continue to work on internal policies to enhance service and response times. Finally our new training
program is off and running. We have run two groups of new hires through this program and have had a
positive response and retention rate.
2016 we are looking at fully implementing two new software programs in our daily dispatch platform.
Automated fire dispatching is intended to decrease dispatch time for the Fort Wayne Fire Department.
Internal policies will need to be reviewed and amended to accomplish this changeover. AVL for first
responders radio’s; this program is to aid in locating our first responders not only for Fort Wayne, but for
Allen County. The CCP will be able to pinpoint a first responder in distress if they activate their panic
button, or the CCP can search for their location if we believe there is an issue.
We continue to work with outside agencies to make sure we are providing the best service not only to our
first responders, but to the Citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County. We are proud to be one of the four
emergency service providers for our community.

FIRE DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement
It is the mission of the Fort Wayne Fire Department to prevent the loss of life and to control or reduce the loss of
property and damage to the environment and promote the safety of our city by applying all of our professional
knowledge, resources, skills and abilities to support a high quality of life for our community. This mission is

The Fort Wayne Fire Department is responsible for operating and maintaining multiple facilities including 18 fire
stations, administrative offices, training academy and tactical grounds, vehicle/equipment maintenance shop, and
the safety village offices/grounds.
The Fire Department’s projection in 2016 is to have 375 sworn fire fighters and 8 civilian employees. The Local
Option Income Tax allowed us to add 22 firefighters in 2014. Between January 2014 and December 2015 we will
have 21 retirements, 7 of which were outside of the DROP program. We are looking to add another 35 in 2016,
10 of which will be paid for by the SAFER grant. It is the goal of the Department to get out headcount back up to
375 firefighters, a level we haven’t seen since the 2006 Aboite Annexation. Maintaining a minimum of 375
personnel provides adequate levels to ensure fire fighter safety and appropriate emergency response to the
community.

INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement:
The Internal Audit Department is committed to the systematic, objective appraisal of diverse operations and
controls within the City to determine that:
 financial and operating information is accurate and reliable,
 risks to the City are identified and minimized,
 regulations, laws, policies and procedures are followed,
 satisfactory standards are met, and
 resources are used efficiently and economically to achieve the City’s objectives.
The department’s efforts are applied towards assisting all members of the organization in the effective discharge
of their responsibilities.
Goals and Objectives:
-

To utilize a structured risk assessment methodology that enables the quantification of risk throughout the
organization, and development of an audit schedule that will promote the review of City operations based
on the risk scores calculated.

-

To present accurate, comprehensive reports that sufficiently cover the scope and objectives of the audit
work performed within the budgeted time frame. This process holds the department accountable for
effective use of its time and also ensures the results of our efforts are properly distributed.

-

To provide sufficient follow-up on audit reports to assess progress in relation to recommendations.
Follow-up audit work will be planned based upon timelines received in audit responses and the results
will be reported. This process enables us to determine whether the adjustments made effectively
address the original information.

-

To conduct consulting services throughout the City, providing assurance with regard to change or
answering questions that management is interested in.

-

To establish and maintain positive working relationships with management through open communications
throughout the audit process. Our goal is to ensure management is well informed and that we maintain a
“no surprises” approach to each project. This goal is intended to build a level of trust between Internal
Audit and management in an effort to become a pro-active resource.

-

To provide a comprehensive continuing professional education program for audit personnel to maintain
the knowledge and skills necessary to satisfactorily perform assigned audits and stay abreast of new
audit tools and techniques.

-

To secure an independent review of the department performance (peer review) at a minimum of once
every three years. This review will address the quality of work performed, the department's compliance
with its objectives and audit standards and the effect the department has had upon the City.

METROPOLITAN HUMAN RELATIONS
The Metropolitan Human Relations Commission (“MHRC”) was established in 1952 by the Common Council of Fort
Wayne to “administer and enforce” anti-discrimination legislation within the territorial boundaries of the City of Fort
Wayne. As primary basis for establishing MHRC, the Mayor and Common Council decreed the following:
“Discrimination in social, cultural and economic life in Fort Wayne against any person or persons because of race, sex,
color, religion, handicap, ancestry, national origin, or place of birth, is contrary to American principles and is harmful to
the social, cultural, and economic life of the city. Discrimination, particularly in employment opportunities, public
accommodations and housing, increases the burden and cost of government; and, such discrimination contributes to
increased crime, vice, juvenile delinquency, fires and other evils thereby affecting the public safety, public health, and
general welfare of the community. It is therefore deemed to be in the best interests of the city to create a metropolitan
Commission to administer and enforce anti-discrimination legislation and ordinances, all as authorized by the Indiana
Civil Rights Act.”
The Commission continues to maintain a high level of productivity in case resolutions, reducing case age in the office,
and implementing stringent case processing protocols to ensure timely resolution of cases. MHRC has set measurable
goals to increase quality of compliance with the regulations of its federal partners, the United States Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and the United States Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). MHRC’s
contractual commitment continues to increase. This continuing increase translates to increased revenue from EEOC
and HUD, thereby reducing the Commission’s reliance on property tax dollars.
VISION STATEMENT
MHRC is focused on, and committed to creating an environment in the City of Fort Wayne that will produce an inclusive
community where trust, acceptance, fairness and equality are the City’s norms. To achieve this vision, the
Commission will be fair, impartial and thorough in assertively enforcing the law, and aggressive in promoting
community outreach and training initiatives.

84

GOALS
I.

To continue to expeditiously investigate all credible allegations and/or conditions that create or promote
adverse effects on persons and/or sections of the City, or conditions and/or allegations that result in a
discriminatory treatment of persons and/or sections of the City on the bases enumerated in Ordinance G21-78.

II.

To expand outreach activities, especially in housing and public accommodation, to schools and colleges
within the territorial boundaries of the City of Fort Wayne. This will include continued partnering with
lending institutions and housing providers to promote fair housing and fair lending practices.

III.

To advertise MHRC’s educational programs and activities to surrounding localities that do not have MHRC
type entity in order to create additional revenue generating scheme for the Commission.

IV.

To expand outreach to local businesses and smaller employers, to aid them in training on civil rights
issues, and provide support and encourage policies which promote and foster fair employment and equal
opportunity for Fort Wayne citizens.

V.

To provide channels of communication among various racial, religious and ethnic groups in the City.

VI.

To provide community mediation services to assist with inter-group conflicts.

VII.

To develop Commission employees into first-rate fair, impartial, and thorough civil rights workers.

VIII.

To expand MHRC’s grant writing activities to seek resources that will enable MHRC to partner and share
those resources with local organizations that provide human relations type services to residents of the City
in the areas of housing, employment, and education, etc.

IX.

To expand the Commission’s alternative dispute resolution program (mediation and conciliation). This
may even include securing outside mediators to assist in mediating and conciliating cases pending before
the Commission.

X.

To actively work with departments of local governments so as to utilize whatever existing programs,
equipment, or personnel they may have and can share in order to help avoid duplicity/redundancy/ and
cost in operations.

XI.

To coordinate regionally and state-wide with other similarly situated local civil rights enforcement agencies
to gain expertise, foster relationships, gain efficiencies of scale and promote sharing of best practices and
resources to further aid in supporting the mission of MHRC to the local community.

XII.

To ensure that the Commission secures the necessary tools needed to enable it to provide services that
are packaged in professionalism but not at the expense of cost effectiveness.

NORTHWEST UNIFORM DIVISION
The Northwest Division is responsible for providing police service to approximately 65,000 citizens living in a
geographical area covering 33.07 square miles. This includes 294 centerline miles of roadway and 7 miles of
the I-69 corridor which generates a significant amount of calls for service such as accidents, road rage
disturbances, stranded motorists and traffic stops. The Northwest Division is home to many restaurants, movie
theatres, shopping centers, and visitor attractions such as the Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo, Science Central, and
War Memorial Coliseum. This division has a very high ratio of calls for service per officer. The officers in this
division serve a very diverse group of citizens representing a wide range of races, cultures and socioeconomic
backgrounds. They work together very well as a team to reduce or eliminate crime where it is occurring to
increase the quality of life for the citizens they have sworn to protect.
NORTHEAST UNIFORM DIVISION
The officers assigned to the Northeast Division patrol approximately thirty square miles and provide service to
approximately 76,000 residents. The Northeast quadrant has increased its retail development in the
Georgetown Business District, along with the opening of the Maplecrest Road Bridge Extension. Although,
crime has been traditionally low in the Northeast Division, changes in the population and demographics have
resulted in an increase of criminal activity in certain neighborhoods and apartment complexes. A focus has
been placed in the areas of thefts from vehicles and residential burglaries. The Division command staff has
presented the residents within the quadrant various crime prevention techniques at several neighborhood
meetings and to the general public in the form of public service announcements. The Northeast quadrant
continues to have the lowest Uniform Crime Report Statistics in the city of Fort Wayne.
SOUTHWEST UNIFORM DIVISION
The Southwest Division serves a population of over 63,000 people within its thirty-five square miles. The
Southwest Quadrant serves citizens from the Historic West-Central Neighborhood, south to the Fort Wayne
International Airport and from the Calhoun corridor, West to Amber Rd. Within in the Southwest Division are the
St. Joseph Medical Center, Lutheran Hospital, and Jefferson Point Mall, which collectively bring many nonresidents into our area. The Fort Wayne Police Department is committed to our residents that live within our
boundaries. We promise to protect the quality of life, provide a safe environment for current and future
generations of families who have called this area home for decades.
SOUTHEAST UNIFORM DIVISION
The officers assigned to the Southeast Division provide service to a diverse community of approximately of
53,000 residents within its 16.5 square miles. The Southeast quadrant encompasses all areas of the city that lie
south of the Maumee River and east of Calhoun Street. In 2009 some of the Downtown entertainment venues
were moved from the Southwest quadrant to the Southeast responsibility. This was done to provide increase
continuity of information, service and patrol strategies. Although, the population and the square miles patrolled
by the Southeast Division are smaller than the other quadrants the calls for service within the Southeast Division
remain the highest of all four quadrants.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISION
The Special Operations Division consists of the following Units:
- Emergency Services Team (EST) OR SWAT Team

- Traffic Unit (Hit/Run)
- Fatal Accident Crash Team (FACT)

2016 GOALS
In the year 2015, the Police Department graduated the 61st Recruit Class consisting of 21 Officers. As of
this report these 21 Officers are currently in Field Training Status, riding with experienced Fort Wayne PD
Officers. Do to retirements, and to bring the Fort Wayne Police Department up to our budgeted strength of
460, we anticipate starting a hiring process for a new Police Recruit Class in February 2016.
In 2015 we began the formation of the Public Safety Response Team (PSRT) whose purpose is to respond to
any civil disturbance or be deployed in advance of any event where they are deemed necessary. They will
respond with the primary mission of protecting life and property. The Team will be under the Command of the
Special Operation Deputy Chief. The Team will consist of a Captain, Lieutenant, 4 Sergeants, and 33 Officers.
Full implementation of this team is expected in 2016.
The creation of a Community Relations Division is anticipated for 2016. The purpose of this Division would be
to enhance the relationship between the FWPD and the community by use of liaison officers, social media,
public media, and community outreach.
As always, we will continue to monitor and respond to the ever-changing public safety and quality-of-life issues
throughout the city. We will provide our employees with a variety of training opportunities that will maintain their
various technical certifications and increase our overall ability to meet the community’s expectations on a daily
basis. We will continue to educate the public about criminal activity within their neighborhoods and provide ongoing assistance on how they can reduce their chance of being victimized.

Lump Sum Distribution found in 36.8.8.24.8.
The trustees are charged with the fiduciary responsibility of overseeing payments of 1925 Act pension funds, the
operation of the office of the pension secretary and the evaluation of potential officers for membership in the
1977 Act fund. The local board also evaluates applications for disability from the 1977 Act and makes
recommendations to the Indiana Public Retirement System (Public Employees Retirement Fund) regarding such
applications.
Members:
Mayor Thomas C. Henry
Controller Patricia Roller
Chief Garry Hamilton

Scott Caudill
Kevin Hunter
Casey Furge

Ronald L. Buskirk (Ret.)
Sonia Atienzo
Zack Carter

There are nine members of the Board of Trustees. Three are members by virtue of office, the Mayor, Controller
and Police Chief. Of the remaining six members, five are elected representatives of the active membership of
police department and one additional member, a retired officer, is elected. The Trustees have staggered three
year terms. The Board of Police Pension Trustees meets monthly on the second Tuesday of each month taking
action as required. Special sessions are called for hearings and hiring reviews.
A member of the board is selected annually to serve as the secretary and is responsible for all payments,
collections, and communications with the benefit recipients. In addition, the secretary is the keeper of the records
of the Fort Wayne Police Pension Fund and as such, is required to communicate with all other entities, which may
choose to correspond with the board.
The laws regarding police officers’ pensions are provided by statute and changes do occur from time to time. It is
necessary for the trustees to be aware of these mandated changes. It is the responsibility of the secretary to
keep all trustees informed of such changes.
It is the responsibility of the board to adopt an annual budget for submission for adoption within the civil city
budget. Since the submitted budget of the pension fund cannot, by Indiana Statute, be reduced, it is essential
that the trustees be extremely cautious when forecasting the funding necessary to meet the needs of the board to
carry out the directions of the laws.

FLOOD CONTROL DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement:
The mission of the Flood Control Department is to ensure that property damage due to flooding is minimal by the
continual monitoring of the early flood warning system ensuring that it is operational; upgrading our flood fighting
strategies; maintaining our 14 plus miles of flood protection structures; and buying properties in the floodplain
mitigating flood damages and creating storage for flood waters.

Goals and Objectives:


Fort Wayne/Allen County Flood Control Project
As our flood control structures age; withstand significant flooding; and complying with the Army Corps of
Engineers more rigid standards, keeping maintenance costs at a minimum will be a challenge in the
coming years. Our department has and will continue to use smaller experienced contractors to
repair/rehabilitate the flood control structures. This will allow us to effectively preserve and maintain our
structures for the protection of Fort Wayne residents and keep maintenance costs at a minimum.



Federal Grants
Flood Control continues to oversee the administration of three approved federal grants to acquire and
demolish residential and commercial properties and remove them from the floodplain/floodway. Flood
Control is nearly complete in acquiring properties in the Junk Ditch and St. Mary’s River area. Goal is
always to look for federal funding opportunities.



Community Rating System Program
The goal of the Federal CRS Program is to encourage, by the use of flood insurance premium
adjustments, Fort Wayne outreach activities beyond those required by the NFIP, saving citizens 10% a
year on flood insurance premiums.

105



Upgraded Early Flood Warning System
The Flood Control Department expanded its early flood warning system from 16 to 32 sites. The data
from this system is critical to the National Weather Service for flood watches, warnings and crest
predictions during a flood. This system was designed to be used by other City Departments, outside
agencies and smaller communities in this area. Flood Control has budgeted to maintain the 32 sites to
continue communicating as designed and for additional sensors to be added to the system for its
expanded use.

STREET LIGHT OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement:
Street Light Operations is responsible for providing sufficient illumination to aid in safe and efficient movement of
pedestrian and motorized traffic during the evening and night time hours, using the latest technology in design,
installation and maintenance.
Goals and Objectives:
1. To design, construct and maintain the existing street lighting facilities for the citizens of Fort Wayne;
2. Continue pole identification program by installing tags on all street lighting facilities to aid in maintenance
work;
3. Convert incandescent series circuit street lighting systems to high pressure sodium street lighting
systems;
4. In 2007 the Hansen Management System was instituted allowing the Dept to better track work processes
and inventory;
5. Replacement of concrete lighting poles in areas where we have noted deterioration;
6. Incorporate enhanced high pressure sodium lamps, in areas with older (15 years or more) lighting
fixtures;
7. Continue to find ways to decrease energy consumption by use of new technology. LED lighting is on the
forefront as we attempt to reach this goal.

RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT

Risk Management identifies, assesses, and prioritizes the various risks within the operation of the City with the
clear goal of loss prevention. We utilize the internal and external resources available to us to minimize, monitor,
control and ideally, to prevent loss. This includes legal liabilities which come in the form of tort claims against the
City, Workers Compensation and Hurt on Duty claims by injured workers, and assuring adequate insurance
coverage for all City assets and general liability and police professional claims.
The City of Fort Wayne has been self-insured for General, Auto, and Police Professional Liabilities since an
ordinance was passed in 1989 establishing the self-insurance fund. Then in 1991, an additional ordinance was
passed establishing the Workers Compensation Fund. All costs for the operating budget of Risk Management,
actuarial costs to maintain proper funding for the General Fund, third party expenses for Workers Compensation
claims processing and loss control are from the fund.
The five-person team includes two Safety Claims Investigators to attend motor vehicle accidents involving City
employees and to perform inspections and investigations to assure OSHA compliance. Members of the team
monitor and maintain the tort claim process, the City’s drug screening process, safety training of City employees,
handling of Workers Comp and Hurt on Duty injuries, as well as maintaining records of employees training,
physicals (CDL, Confined Space, Post Offer and Workability exams) and immunizations. We also participate in
interdepartmental groups such as FMLA and insurance committees, and ADA Coordinator duties. This continual
monitoring and management for these functions in all City departments provides excellent stewardship of
taxpayers’ money.

STREET DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement
The primary mission of the Street Department is to provide the citizens of Fort Wayne with a well-maintained and
safe transportation infrastructure. We strive to render cost effective, competent service including snow removal,
street resurfacing, leaf pick-up, street sweeping and overall street maintenance.
Goals and Objectives
Pothole response time remains a top priority for the department, maintaining an average response time of less
than three hours. Paving, and chip and seal resurfacing remain top priorities where our summer construction
season is concerned. In 2016 we plan to pave 12 miles of city streets and complete 10 miles of chip and seal
resurfacing. Throughout the summer months, we also provide several other city services such as street sweeping,
alley maintenance, right of way mowing, trail maintenance, and crack sealing.

In 2014, we purchased a new crack seal pouring machine, replacing our old one which was more than ten years
old. This purchase brings improved operator efficiency to a program that helps to preserve our street paving
investment. We now also incorporate four heated asphalt trailers that we use throughout the city. These allow us
to keep our asphalt hot throughout the day, regardless of the temperature outside, giving us much higher
efficiency with respect to the “shelf life” of the material, as well as our response time. They are also excellent for
“cold mix” in the winter months, making the material much more pliable in extreme temperatures for better
applications, increasing patch durability.
In recent years, we have significantly escalated our level of service towards helping to maintain the Fort Wayne
Trails system. We provide for the cutback of vegetation and trees, garbage removal, grass cutting, carpentry work
on bridges and decks, repaving, and trail rebuilding as required by floods whenever necessary. This goes a long
way to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all who utilize the trails whether they walk, run, or ride their bicycles.
Our leaf program is working well and we are again prepared to collect more than 5,000 truckloads or, roughly
20,000 tons of leaves this year. We will also collect all bagged leaves reported to the 311 call center within 2
business days. Throughout the winter, we strive to keep the city streets clear of snow and ice to ensure safe
travel for motorists.

TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING SERVICES
Street Project Management Department
Mission Statement
Street Project Management is a department within the Division of Public Works, Transportation Engineering section.
The mission of the Street Project Management Department is to plan, design and implement the construction and
repair of a safe and efficient transportation system within the City of Fort Wayne.
The City Engineer directs the Street Project Management section of Transportation Engineering. The duty of the City
Engineer is to oversee the preparation of plans and specifications for the competitive bidding of Capital Improvement
Programs, Public Works Maintenance projects requiring engineering expertise and all other improvement projects
necessary for the safe, efficient and economical operation of the Public Works Division of the City of Fort Wayne
government.
Goals and Objectives


Plan, design, and construct neighborhood projects in the year they are planned for construction.

It’s important to fulfill commitments for street, curb and walk improvements in the year those commitments were made.
This will be accomplished by beginning the design process earlier once projects have been selected. This goal will
strengthen our customer’s confidence in our services. Our customers are the citizens of Fort Wayne and their
designated government representatives.


Maintain and update the Pavement Management System.

Keeping this database up to date will ensure we are concentrating on the infrastructure that needs the most attention.
The Pavement Management System will also help determine from year to year how well we are accomplishing our
goals and whether those goals should be re-evaluated. We update our system by reassessing at least 1/3 of our total
miles each year.
This system is our tracking device to measure our success in improving the pavement condition citywide. The overall
system condition in 2014 was rated in the “Good” condition category.
Our customers; the engineers, planners, government representatives, and the citizens of Fort Wayne, are important to
us and together we depend on this information to make sound decisions about Transportation projects. Street Project
management will


Assist the Street Maintenance Department in our calculated goal of asphalt resurfacing of 52 miles of
asphalt roads and streets through contracted services.



Repair or reconstruct in our calculated goal of 10 miles of concrete streets through contracted services.

It’s imperative to keep up with the pace of deterioration our infrastructure experiences each year. We have determined
these are miles of pavement that must be improved upon to keep the overall system condition in the “Good” condition
level. To meet our established goals, appropriate funding must be dedicated towards transportation related
infrastructure.
If we can provide a well-maintained transportation system, businesses will be attracted to Fort Wayne and ultimately
create new jobs. A well maintained system will also reduce our liability from accidents stemming from poor pavement
condition. Our customers are the citizens of Fort Wayne who expect a safe and reliable transportation system.

118

Long-term goals:
Our long-term goal is to incorporate a multi-year maintenance and repair plan, as well as an estimate, for each street
segment of the city into the Pavement Management System database.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES DEPARTMENT
It is the mission of the Department of Weights & Measures to ensure equity in the marketplace for both merchants and
consumers. The department is responsible for the testing and inspection of all commercial weighing and measuring
devices, enforcing the City Ordinance regarding taxicab operations, enforcing the City Weights and Measures
Ordinance, and enforcing State Codes governing Weights and Measures.
The principal duty of our department is to test, certify, and seal correct devices; or order correction, condemn and
confiscate faulty devices or commodities offered for sale by weight or count.
In our 2014-2015 reporting year, 20,272 inspections were performed.

2016 Goals:
1) The primary goal for Weights & Measures is to continue our efforts of ensuring equity in the marketplace. The
importance of ensuring the accuracy of weighing and measuring devices can best be illustrated by example:



A Deli scale that weighs 1 oz. over or under weight (with an assumed average of 100 purchases per day
@ $2.00 per pound) will result in a $4,500+ annual loss for the business or their customers.
A single gasoline pump that delivers 5 cubic inches (about 5 tablespoons) per gallon over or under volume
(with assumed average sales) can result in a $5,000+ annual loss for the business or their customers.

2) To ensure continuing commitment to our primary goal, and in a culture of ever evolving standards and devices,
currency in training must be maintained. Correct, consistent, and fair enforcement of weights and measures
laws require both initial and continuing education of inspectors. Therefore, it is our goal to use every
opportunity to seek out cost effective training. and utilize the course materials available to us through our
membership in the National Conference of Weights and Measures.

Services Provided:






Inspect all commercial weighing and measuring devices within the City, such as vehicle and computing scales,
gasoline pumps, taximeters, commercial and prescription scales.
Inspect packaged goods sold within the City by weight, measure, or count, or marked for weight, measure, or
count.
Enforce state codes and city ordinances that apply to weights and measures.
Order correction of, or condemn, or confiscate faulty devices or commodities that are sold by weight, measure, or
count.
Prepare monthly and annual reports for the Fire Chief, Board of Public Safety, and the State Weights and
Measures Division.

MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES
Alcohol Gallonage Tax - Income generated from a state-imposed tax on every gallon of alcoholic
beverages sold.
Auto Excise Tax - Income derived, in lieu of personal property tax, on all motor vehicles, except
those that fall under the commercial vehicle excise tax classification.
Cable TV Franchise Fees - The City receives a percentage, currently 5%, of either the gross
annual subscriber receipts or the franchisee’s gross annual receipts, whichever is greater.
Commercial Vehicle Excise Tax – Revenue based on the weight of the vehicle and is paid at the
time of registration. The base for this tax is commercial vehicles such as tractors and trailers that
were subject to the property tax.
County Option Income Tax - Revenue generated from the income of those persons working
within Allen County. This tax is at a level of .6% effective July 1, 1994.
Local Option Income Tax – The base for this tax is the same as the County Option Income Tax,
individual Indiana taxable income in Allen County. The Allen County Income Tax Council in June
of 2013 approved a Property Tax Relief (PTR) LOIT of .25% and a Public Safety (PS) LOIT of
.10% which will be effective October 1, 2013. These LOIT’s are also referred to as a type of COIT.
Economic Development Income Tax - The base for this tax is the same as the County Option
Income Tax, individual Indiana taxable income in Allen County. This tax is at a level of .4%
effective July 1, 1998.
Financial Institutions Tax - This tax is based upon a combination of the net income and the
personal property of financial institutions.
Fuel Tax - Taxes generated from the sale of gasoline and other fuels.
General Tobacco Tax - Revenue received from the taxation of all cigarettes sold, used,
consumed, handled or distributed with the state.
Interest Income - Revenue earned as the City invests its idle funds in various investment
vehicles.
Liquor Excise Tax - Income generated from the sale and renewal of liquor licenses.
Property Tax - The largest source of City revenues. This tax results from the tax rate applied
against the assessed value of the property.
Other sources of revenue include, but are not limited to: animal control licenses, payments in lieu
of taxes, ordinance violations, rental property, zoning fees, engineering and technical service fees,
grants and other contributions.

TAXES BASED ON INCOME
In March of 1989, the Common Council of the City of Fort Wayne enacted the County Option Income Tax (COIT), one of
three local option income taxes available to counties under State statutes in Indiana, as part of a tax reform package. Also,
available to counties under Indiana law is the County Adjusted Gross Income Tax (CAGIT) and the County Economic
Development Income Tax (CEDIT). The Common Council controlled enactment of the tax at that time based on the fact
that the City comprised 58.5% of the population of Allen County, even though the Allen County COIT Council actually
enacts the tax.
The tax reform effort involved two primary strategies. One, it is appropriate to tax those citizens who live outside the City
but use City services such as roads and streets, fire protection, and police protection while they work in Fort Wayne. To a
modest extent, COIT accomplishes that. Two, adding a different tax base into the picture, income as opposed to property,
broadens and distributes the total tax burden in a fairer manner. COIT accomplishes that as well.
The tax reform package also included an increase in the Homestead Property Tax Credit from 4% to 12% by 1992 and a flat
property tax rate through 1992. The COIT tax began on July 1, 1989 at a rate of .2% on Indiana adjusted gross income.
Because of fluctuations in the base upon which COIT is computed, revenue could vary more from year to year than does
property tax revenue.
COIT increased to .3% on July 1, 1990, where it remained frozen until July 1, 1992. In March of 1992, the Common
Council removed a self-imposed freeze on the COIT tax and allowed it to go to .4% effective July 1, 1992. The Common
Council increased COIT to .5% effective July 1, 1993 and to .6% effective July 1, 1994. The City receives revenues from
the State of Indiana on a delayed basis.
In March of 1993, the Common Council enacted the Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) for Allen County at a
level of .2% effective July 1, 1993. Use of these funds is restricted to projects related to economic development,
infrastructure improvements, Parks and Safety capital expenditures or payment on bonds to fund any of these types of
projects. In March of 1998, Common Council voted to increase the rate to .4% effective July 1, 1998.
The Allen County Income Tax Council in June of 2013 approved a Property Tax Relief (PTR) Local Option Income Tax

DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL CARE & CONTROL
The Department of Animal Care and Control faces the public health and safety issues involving animals
using a proactive approach. Protection of citizens and animals, animal rescue, and efforts to minimize
euthanasia of unwanted animals through spay/neuter promotion all strongly reflect the neighborhood and
community driven origins of this agency. Local and state legislation is used to address cruelty or violence
issues involving animals, pet overpopulation, and responsible pet ownership issues. The success of the
approach would not be possible without positive community outreach and education.
The City ordinance delineates the laws to be enforced and the responsibilities of the department toward
achieving an overall professional and quality program. The ordinance is seen as a model in the country
and this department has been recognized nationally as a leader in the field, with multiple employees who
have been national instructors in specific areas of the profession. Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control
will continue to provide high levels of service in all areas and continue enforcement aimed at the protection
and assistance of both community residents and animals. We will strive to increase promotion of
responsible animal ownership to increase the safety levels in our community and to combat pet
overpopulation and its resulting euthanasia of domestic animals.

Programming and Initiatives
In the last three years we have downsized employee numbers by count and by hours. Yet, our cruelty and
neglect prosecutions are at an all-time high with criminal conviction rates rising to a level never seen in Fort
Wayne before. That is due to staff dedication, training, community outreach education, and an extremely
supportive law department and prosecutors office. We also launched an ordinance initiative to modernize
approaches and to take greater advantage of the collaborative relationships we have built over these last
several years. Our new Community Cat program is something we could not have achieved on our own. Local
non-profit agencies that are better armed to focus on adoption initiatives through grant opportunities and
enhanced spay/neuter efforts at high volume with targeted work are now more available than ever before in
our community. The primary focus of a government agency is health, safety, and cruelty prevention efforts.
That ultimately limits our abilities and resources for highest possible adoption rates if we do not have active
community partners. I am happy to say our partnerships are stronger than they have ever been, both locally
and nationally.
We have raised the bar in so many areas in this agency that the challenge becomes sustaining the
programming and continuing to achieve life-saving goals, all within budget constraints. As a government
agency we receive the highest volume of animals in all of northeast Indiana. Some of those animals are not
safe to move back out to the community, but many are simply in need of opportunities that cannot be found
without aggressive efforts at pro-actively finding space and resources to assist them. Our agency has been
meeting those challenges by pursuing partnerships to assist us in rehoming animals beyond the volume that
our own adoption center space, hours, and staffing allows. We work closely with both the Allen County SPCA
and the Whitley County Humane Society to transfer animals for adoption while still keeping our own adoption
center marketable. We have non-profit rescue organizations that foster animals in private homes, and then
place to their forever homes from there. All this partnering allows our own shelter to open more space for our
community pets that are temporarily lost by their owners, to quarantine bite cases, or to house the victims of
cruelty, neglect, and abuse. The overall result of all this cooperation is a safer city, an increase in placements,
and more opportunities for those animals with minor issues that need to be addressed before adoption. So,
more lives saved. We track success through a figure called our “Live Release Rate” and 2013 brought the
highest success ever in that area; not only for FWACC, but for our Community Coalition totals as well.
This budget reflects a maintenance approach to our current programming that recognizes the fiscal constraints
we all face at this time. However, our coalition partnerships will bring additional opportunities and financing into
our city in 2015, including the support for our new Community Cat programming. Our plan is to heighten these
creative and collaborative approaches while continuing our internal advancements that ultimately result in a
safer community and more life saving prospects for our animals.

Goals and Objectives
Our Mission: Guided by the humane ethic and livability interests within our neighborhoods, the
mission of Fort Wayne Animal Care & Control is to ensure public health and safety as well as
prevent pet overpopulation, animal neglect, and animal cruelty through education, rescue, and
law enforcement.

neighborhood level, indiscriminate breeding of animals in the city, and euthanasia.
4. To increase education levels of both children and adults relative to safety, humane care and treatment of
animals, responsible pet ownership and the plight of unwanted animals.
5. To continue promotion of all local available opportunities for families unable to afford the spay or neuter
surgery for their pet.

BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION
Mission Statement
The mission of Benefits Administration is to promote the health and well-being of City employees,
retirees, and their families, by providing excellent customer service through the administration of City
benefits programs.
Benefits Administration is part of the Human Resources Department. This allows Benefits Administration
to partner with the Human Resources staff to promote a positive working environment and improve
communications to all City employees and departments. Benefits Administration continues to work closely
with the Controller’s Office and the Payroll Department in many aspects that are necessary to administer
City benefits programs.

Goals and Objectives
The goals for Benefits Administration are:











Provide excellent customer service to employees, retirees and their dependents.
Act as a liaison between providers, and employees and retirees, to resolve benefits issues.
Review benefit programs and make recommendations for change and/or improvement.
Maintain accurate records of employees and retirees relating to: health insurance, COBRA
administration, life insurance, long-term disability, short-term disability, flexible spending accounts,
and FMLA.
Monitor provider billings to detect errors and contain costs.
Continue to maintain and develop the Flexible Spending Account program in order to save employees
and the City of Fort Wayne on taxable income. Flexible Spending Accounts are tax-favored accounts
that allow employees to set aside money pretax for eligible Medical and Dependent Care costs.
Claims are processed through the Benefits office and reimbursed on employee payroll checks biweekly. As an employer, the City of Fort Wayne saves on every dollar that passes through the Flex
program by reducing its FICA liability.
Develop and implement wellness programs for employees, retirees and their families, to improve the
quality of life of these individuals and mitigate benefit costs, including but not limited to annual Health
Fairs, monthly wellness seminars and a Smoking Cessation Program.
Develop, maintain and comply with a benefits administration procedure manual.
Develop and maintain good working relationships with benefit providers, HR Department, Payroll
Department, Controller’s Office and departmental payroll clerks in order to foster cooperation and
provide good customer service to employees, retirees and family members.

CABLE FUND
Mission Statement
The primary purpose of the cable fund is to enhance public, educational, and government access
television within the City of Fort Wayne, through the effective use of cable television franchise fee
receipts.
1. Effectively and efficiently administer the grant program.
2. Monitor the cable provider’s compliance with the franchise agreement.
3. Respond to citizen complaints regarding cable television service and resolve any
cable television issues as quickly and equitably as possible.

General Information
60% of the franchise fee revenues collected by Comcast Cablevision and Frontier
Communications are deposited directly into the General Fund. The remaining 40% are
applied to the Cable Fund, and their use is detailed below.
In the previous four quarters ending June 30, 2014, $1,635,184.68 was receipted to the
General Fund and $1,090,123.12 was receipted to the Cable Fund. Franchise fee based
disbursements from the Cable Fund are allocated based on a formula, as established by
ordinance G-27-95.
The Cable Fund supports these programs:
Access Originator grants: General ordinance G-27-95 stipulates that 80% of the cable
franchise fees receipted to the Cable Fund be disbursed, as recommended by the Cable
Fund Access Board, to the four access channel originators in our community: college
access television, operated by Indiana University/Purdue University; public access,
operated by the Allen County Public Library; government access, managed by the City of
Fort Wayne with daily operations subcontracted to the Allen County Public Library; and
educational access, operated by Fort Wayne Community Schools. Access Originator
Grants are disbursed quarterly. In the four quarters ending June 30 2014, each access
originator received $218,025, for a total of $872,098. The 2015 program (166ACTR)
budget is $900,000. (The amount budgeted does not affect the amount granted, as the
amount granted is always a fixed percent of franchise fee revenue. However, to avoid
revising the budget, the amount budgeted should be safely above the last years revenue
receipts.)
Non-access originator grants: G-27-95 also specifies that 10% of franchise fees
receipted to the Cable Fund be available as grants to not-for-profit organizations located
within Fort Wayne that do not originate an access station, for the purpose of enhancing
local access. These grants can be used in a variety of ways, as long as it relates to

Consolidated Communications Partnership
SHERIFF KEN FRIES

COMMISSIONER THERESE BROWN

POLICE CHIEF GARRY HAMILTON

FIRE CHIEF ERIC LAHEY

The Consolidated Communications Partnership (CCP) is the line between citizens and public safety
personnel. We are committed to developing a partnership with the community and the agencies we serve.
We are aware of the roles we play and strive to provide quality, efficient, accurate information, and superior
service to ensure the safety of both the community and public safety personnel. We continually strive for
professionalism, dedication and service to the community with each task we are assigned.
911 Center Goals


Provide immediate, accurate and professional service in Police, Fire and Medical emergencies to
the citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County.



Provide efficient, accurate and professional assistance to Public Safety and Public Service
personnel so that they may deliver the most effective responses to the needs of the citizens of Fort
Wayne / Allen County.



Maintain hardware and software for our employees so that they may continue to provide the highest
possible standard of service to the citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County



Plan for bringing onboard outside agencies that service Fort Wayne / Allen County.



Meet and exceed training standards as set by APCO, Priority Dispatch.

2014 Has been a challenging year for the CCP. Not only have we moved into a new dispatch facility with all
new equipment, but have also seen changes in Police, Fire and CCP administration. With these changes,
each employee has continued to strive for excellent service to the Citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County,
and to Public Safety personnel. February 2014, we moved IPFW officers to the NorthEast Police talkgroup, which houses the FWPD officers who work the North East section of Fort Wayne. Making this
change helps the flow of information between IPFW and FWPD when a joint incident occurs.
Beginning in 2015 we are planning on rebuilding our current training curriculum to ensure new employees
have standardized and up to date training. This curriculum will also ensure we exceed minimum standards
to keep all CCP Dispatchers certified as Emergency (Medical, Fire, Police) Dispatchers. 2015 will also bring
new technology to the CCP. This technology will assist Dispatchers select and dispatch closest Fire units
to the scene of an emergency.
This has been a challenging year for us, and next year we are not only looking for an exciting year, but for a
productive year helping the citizens of Fort Wayne / Allen County.

INTERNAL AUDIT
Mission Statement:
The Internal Audit Department is committed to the systematic, objective appraisal of the diverse
operations and controls within the City to determine that:
 financial and operating information is accurate and reliable,
 risks to the City are identified and minimized,
 regulations, laws, and policies and procedures are followed,
 satisfactory standards are met,
 resources are used efficiently and economically to achieve the City’s objectives –
all for the purpose of assisting members of the organization in the effective discharge of their
responsibilities.

Goals and Objectives:
-

To utilize a structured risk assessment methodology to enable the Internal Audit function to
quantify the level of risk related to City departments and processes. Internal Audit can then
develop an appropriate audit schedule that will ensure adequate review of all City operations
based on the risk scores calculated for each department factoring in previous audit coverage.

-

To present accurate, comprehensive reports to management, the Audit Committee, and others
covering the scope and objectives of assigned audits included in the audit plan within the time
frame approved by the Audit Committee. This process holds the department accountable for
effective use of its time and also ensures the results of our effort are provided to management.

-

To provide sufficient follow-up on audit reports to determine the degree of compliance with audit
recommendations. The department will strive to perform follow-up audits within 18 – 24 months
of the original audit report date.
This process will enable us to determine whether
recommendations are implemented.

-

To provide consultation services to management and staff in an effort to ensure adequate
implementation of change or new processes in order to reduce the time required by audit staff for
subsequent review and troubleshooting after the process has been implemented.

-

To establish and maintain constructive working relations with management through use of interim
briefings during the audit engagement, draft report review and a constructive orientation for
reporting. This goal will ensure management is well informed throughout the audit process and
that we maintain a “no surprises” approach to each project. This goal is intended to build a level
of trust between Internal Audit and management in an effort to become a pro-active resource.

-

To provide a comprehensive continuing professional education program for audit personnel to
maintain the knowledge and skills necessary to satisfactorily perform assigned audits and stay
abreast of new audit tools and techniques.

-

To have an independent review of the department performance (peer review) at a minimum once
every three years. This review should address the quality of work performed, the department's
compliance with its objectives and audit standards and the affect the department has had upon
the City.

METROPOLITAN HUMAN RELATIONS
The Metropolitan Human Relations Commission (“MHRC”) was established in 1952 by the Common Council of Fort
Wayne to “administer and enforce” anti-discrimination legislation within the territorial boundaries of the City of Fort
Wayne. As primary basis for establishing MHRC, the Mayor and Common Council decreed the following:
“Discrimination in social, cultural and economic life in Fort Wayne against any person or persons because of race,
sex, color, religion, handicap, ancestry, national origin, or place of birth, is contrary to American principles and is
harmful to the social, cultural, and economic life of the city. Discrimination, particularly in employment opportunities,
public accommodations and housing, increases the burden and cost of government; and, such discrimination
contributes to increased crime, vice, juvenile delinquency, fires and other evils thereby affecting the public safety,
public health, and general welfare of the community. It is therefore deemed to be in the best interests of the city to
create a metropolitan Commission to administer and enforce anti-discrimination legislation and ordinances, all as
authorized by the Indiana Civil Rights Act.”
The Commission continues to maintain a high level of productivity in case resolutions, reducing case age in the
office, and implementing stringent case processing protocols to ensure timely resolution of cases. MHRC has set
measurable goals to increase quality of compliance with the regulations of its federal partners, the United States
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and the United States Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”). MHRC’s contractual commitment continues to increase. This continuing increase translates to increased
revenue from EEOC and HUD, thereby reducing the Commission’s reliance on property tax dollars.
VISION STATEMENT
MHRC is focused on, and committed to creating an environment in the City of Fort Wayne that will produce an
inclusive community where trust, acceptance, fairness and equality are the City’s norms. To achieve this vision, the
Commission will be fair, impartial and thorough in assertively enforcing the law, and aggressive in promoting
community outreach and training initiatives.

70

GOALS
I.

To continue to expeditiously investigate all credible allegations and/or conditions that create or promote
adverse effects on persons and/or sections of the City, or conditions and/or allegations that result in a
discriminatory treatment of persons and/or sections of the City on the bases enumerated in Ordinance
G-21-78.

II.

To expand outreach activities, especially in housing and public accommodation, to schools and colleges
within the territorial boundaries of the City of Fort Wayne. This will include continued partnering with
lending institutions and housing providers to promote fair housing and fair lending practices.

III.

To advertise MHRC’s educational programs and activities to surrounding localities that do not have
MHRC type entity in order to create additional revenue generating scheme for the Commission.

IV.

To expand outreach to local businesses and smaller employers, to aid them in training on civil rights
issues, and provide support and encourage policies which promote and foster fair employment and
equal opportunity for Fort Wayne citizens.

V.

To provide channels of communication among various racial, religious and ethnic groups in the City.

VI.

To provide community mediation services to assist with inter-group conflicts.

VII.

To develop Commission employees into first-rate fair, impartial, and thorough civil rights workers.

VIII.

To expand MHRC’s grant writing activities to seek resources that will enable MHRC to partner and share
those resources with local organizations that provide human relations type services to residents of the
City in the areas of housing, employment, and education, etc.

IX.

To expand the Commission’s alternative dispute resolution program (mediation and conciliation). This
may even include securing outside mediators to assist in mediating and conciliating cases pending
before the Commission.

X.

To actively work with departments of local governments so as to utilize whatever existing programs,
equipment, or personnel they may have and can share in order to help avoid duplicity/redundancy/ and
cost in operations.

XI.

To coordinate regionally and state-wide with other similarly situated local civil rights enforcement
agencies to gain expertise, foster relationships, gain efficiencies of scale and promote sharing of best
practices and resources to further aid in supporting the mission of MHRC to the local community.

XII.

To ensure that the Commission secures the necessary tools needed to enable it to provide services that
are packaged in professionalism but not at the expense of cost effectiveness.

Fort Wayne Police Department
MISSION STATEMENT
The Fort Wayne Police Department, in partnership with our community, will strive to protect the life, property,
and personal liberties of all individuals. We believe that the overall quality of life for all residents will improve
through the deterrence of criminal activity and an understanding of the diversity of cultures within this
community. Furthermore, we recognize the need for fair and impartial enforcement of the law with attention
given the highest possible quality of service delivery to the community.
CURRENTLY
At this time, the Fort Wayne police department’s main headquarters is located at #1 Main Street in the Edwin
Rousseau Building. In addition to the new headquarters, we will continue to utilize four “outposts” to provide
our Uniform personnel with a satellite office within their assigned quadrant of patrol. The Northwest outpost is
located at Lima Road and Northland inside Fire Station-15; the Northeast outpost is situated in a building
provided by Parkview Hospital, at the corner of East State and Beacon Street; and the Southwest outpost is
housed in Fire Station-17, on Getz Road. The satellite office for the Southeast Division is housed in the Police
Benevolent Association Hall located on South Calhoun. We also occupy offices and training facilities at the
Public Safety Academy.
The Fort Wayne Police Department is commanded by Chief Garry Hamilton who reports directly to the Public
Safety Director, Rusty York.
As of this report, the Fort Wayne Police Department has 442 sworn officers and 34 civilian personnel. We
anticipate starting a new police recruit class in January 2015, which will primarily be funded through a grant, and
bring our sworn total to our budgeted strength of 460.
The Fort Wayne Police Department’s sworn and civilian personnel are distributed into to six different
divisions/groups. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of the responsibilities that are unique to
each group. Although each has their individual characteristics and concerns, they all share the common goal of
improving the quality of life for the visitors and residents of Fort Wayne.
INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT DIVISION
The Investigative Support Division (ISD) provides support to the Fort Wayne Police Department by conducting in
depth investigations into felony occurrences within the City. The ISD is staffed with Supervisors, Detectives,
Technicians, and civilian personnel that support the many facets involved in the investigation of felony incidents.
The roles of those within the ISD include, but are not limited to, conducting interviews and interrogations of
persons involved, gathering, packaging and testing evidence as well as providing further investigative support
for the departments uniform operations divisions. The ISD is sub-divided into several areas of responsibility that
include; the Detective Bureau, the Juvenile Aid/Missing Person Section, the Vice and Narcotics Section, The
Gang and Violent Crimes Unit, the Victim’s Assistance Program, the Evidence and Property Section, the Crime
Analysis Unit, the Police Laboratory, Crime Scene Management, and the Crime Stoppers Office.
NORTHWEST UNIFORM DIVISION
The Northwest Division is responsible for providing police service to approximately 65,000 citizens living in a
geographical area covering 33.07 square miles. This includes 294 centerline miles of roadway and 7 miles of
the I-69 corridor which generates a significant amount of calls for service such as accidents, road rage
disturbances, stranded motorists and traffic stops. This division has a very high ratio of calls for service per
officer. Some of these calls for service originate from thieves who target patrons of the vast number of
businesses served by this division. Most of these thefts involve stealing items such as purses and wallets that
contain credit cards from vehicles parked at restaurants, movie theatres shopping centers and visitor attractions
such as the Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo, Science Central and War Memorial Coliseum. The officers in this
division serve a very diverse group of citizens of representing a wide range of races, cultures and
socioeconomic backgrounds. They work together very well as a team to reduce or eliminate crime where it is
occurring to increase the quality of life for the citizens they have sworn to protect.
79

NORTHEAST UNIFORM DIVISION
The officers assigned to the Northeast Division patrol approximately twenty six square miles and provided
service to approximately 76,000 residents. The Northeast quadrant has increased its retail development in the
Georgetown Business District, along with the opening of the Maplecrest Road Bridge Extension. Although,
crime has been traditionally low in the Northeast Division, changes in the population and demographics have
resulted in an increase of criminal activity in certain neighborhoods and apartment complexes. A focus has
been placed in the areas of thefts from vehicles and residential burglaries. The Division command staff has
presented the residents within the quadrant various crime prevention techniques at several neighborhood
meetings and to the general public in the form of public service announcements. The Northeast quadrant
continues to have the lowest Uniform Crime Report Statistics in the city of Fort Wayne.
SOUTHWEST UNIFORM DIVISION
The Southwest Division serves a population of over 63,000 people within its thirty-five square miles. The
Southwest Quadrant serves citizens from the Historic West-Central Neighborhood, south to the Fort Wayne
International Airport and from the Calhoun corridor, west to Aboite Township. Within in the Southwest Division
are the St. Joseph Medical Center, Lutheran Hospital, and the Jefferson Point Mall, which collectively bring
many non-residents into those commercial areas. The Officers, Supervisors, and Command Staff of the
Southwest Division are committed to working with the Southwest area partnerships, Lutheran and St. Joseph
Security Staff, as well as the Fort Wayne International Airport Police to prevent and solve crime in the
Southwest Quadrant. In 2013 the Hispanic Liaison program was placed under the Southwest Divisions
responsibility. The Southwest area has seen a significant growth in its multi cultural communities. The Hispanic
Liaison program has grown to accommodate not only the Hispanic community but the emerging communities as
well. Also added in 2013 for the Southwest division is the Fort Wayne Police Reserve program. This program
oversees the civilian officers who donate their time to the city for such events as the 3 Rivers Festival, Fort for
Fitness, and the Johnny Appleseed Festival.
SOUTHEAST UNIFORM DIVISION
The officers assigned to the Southeast Division provide service to a diverse community of approximately of
53,000 residents within its 16.5 square miles. The Southeast quadrant encompasses all areas of the city that lie
south of the Maumee River and east of Calhoun Street. In 2009 some of the Downtown entertainment venues
were moved from the Southwest quadrant to the Southeast responsibility. This was done to provide increase
continuity of information, service and patrol strategies. Although, the population and the square miles patrolled
by the Southeast Division are smaller than the other quadrants the calls for service within the Southeast Division
remain the highest of all four quadrants.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISION
The Special Operations Division consists of the following Units:
-Emergency Services Team (EST) OR SWAT Team
-Explosive Ordinance / Hazardous Devices Unit (EOD/HDU)
-Traffic Unit (Hit/Run)
-Fatal Accident Crash Team (FACT)
-Crisis Response Team (CRT) or Hostage Negotiation Team
-Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)
The Deputy Chief over this Division is also responsible for coordinating and staffing all Special Events in the City
and the Police vehicle fleet.
CHIEF’S STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT
The Chief’s administrative staff consists of sworn and civilian personnel who assist with the human resource and
business issues inherent to an organization that employs approximately five hundred people.
The various groups that are part of the Chief’s administrative staff include the Academy personnel; the School
Child Safety and School Resource Officer programs; the Hispanic Liaison program; Fiscal Affairs; Grants and
Research; the Office of Professional Standards/Internal Affairs; the Information Systems and Technology Unit,
and the Public Information Officer. In addition, the Chief of Police is a member of the combined Fort
Wayne/Allen County Communications Board.

2015 GOALS
In the year 2014, the Police Department saw the development of the Department’s “Gang and Violent Crimes
Unit”. This Unit consists of 12 FWPD Officers, 2 FWPD Sergeants, and 1 Indiana State Police Officer. The Unit
was developed to address Gang violence and other violent crime in the Fort Wayne/Allen County area.
In 2014 the Fort Wayne Police Department graduated the 60th Recruit Class from our Academy. Also in 2014
we saw the implementation of the electronic submission for time off. This will save in printing cost and allow
Officers more to receive their notice of time off more quickly. We have begun sending copies of protective
orders electronically, to Officers in the field with printers, in order for the protective orders to be served more
efficiently. This year the newest patrol cars have been equipped with video cameras that automatically
download when Officers are near the station or an outpost. This reduces the Officer’s down time and the cost
associated with storage. We started a downtown Bicycle patrol for the spring and summer of 2014 to ensure the
safety of all citizens working or visiting downtown.
In January 2015 we will seat the 61st Recruit Class that will graduate in May of 2015. We are also planning to
institute an online booking process that Officers can use to save time and printing cost when booking in
prisoners. We look to continue the downtown patrols year round to have better visibility and better inaction with
visitors to the downtown area.
As always, we will continue to monitor and respond to the ever-changing public safety and quality-of-life issues
throughout the city. We will provide our employees with a variety of training opportunities that will maintain their
various technical certifications and increase our overall ability to meet the community’s expectations on a daily
basis. We will continue to educate the public about criminal activity within their neighborhoods and provide ongoing assistant on how they can reduce their chance of being victimized.

POLICE PENSION
The mission of the Board of Pension Trustees is outlined in Indiana Statutes found in: IC 36-8-6 for the
1925 fund, IC 36-8-8 for the 1977 fund, and IC 38-8-8.5 for the Deferred Option Retirement Programs
(DROP) and Partial Lump Sum Distribution found in 36.8.8.24.8.
The trustees are charged with the fiduciary responsibility of overseeing payments of 1925 Act pension
funds, the operation of the office of the pension secretary and the evaluation of potential officers for
membership in the 1977 Act fund. The local board also evaluates applications for disability from the 1977
Act and makes recommendations to the Indiana Public Retirement System (Public Employees Retirement
Fund) regarding such applications.
Members:
Mayor Thomas C. Henry
Controller Patricia Roller
Chief Garry Hamilton

Ronald L. Buskirk (Ret.)
Sonia Atienzo
Zack Carter

Scott Caudill
Kevin Hunter
Casey Furge

There are nine members of the Board of Trustees. Three are members by virtue of office, the Mayor, the
Controller and Police Chief. Of the remaining six members, five are elected representatives of the active
membership of police department and one additional member, a retired officer, is elected. The Trustees
have alternating three year terms. The Board of Police Pension Trustees meets monthly on the second
Tuesday of each month taking action as required. Special sessions are called for hearings and hiring
reviews.
A member of the board is selected annually to serve as the secretary and is responsible for all payments,
collections, and communications with the benefit recipients. In addition, the secretary is the keeper of the
records of the Fort Wayne Police Pension Fund and as such is required to communicate with all other
entities, which may choose to correspond with the board.
The laws regarding police officers’ pensions are provided by statute and changes do occur from time to
time. It is necessary for the trustees to be aware of these mandated changes. It is the responsibility of
the secretary to keep all trustees informed of such changes.
It is the responsibility of the board to adopt an annual budget for submission for adoption within the civil
city budget. Since the submitted budget of the pension fund cannot, by Indiana Statute, be reduced, it is
essential that the trustees be extremely cautious when forecasting the funding necessary to meet the
needs of the board to carry out the directions of the laws.

As our flood control structures age; withstand significant flooding; and complying with the Army
Corps of Engineers more rigid standards, keeping maintenance costs at a minimum will be a
challenge in the coming years. Our department has and will continue to use smaller experienced
contractors to repair/rehabilitate the flood control structures. This will allow us to effectively
preserve and maintain our structures for the protection of Fort Wayne residents and keep
maintenance costs at a minimum.



Federal Grants
Flood Control continues to oversee the administration of three approved federal grants to acquire
and demolish residential and commercial properties and remove them from the
floodplain/floodway. Flood Control is nearly complete in acquiring properties in the Junk Ditch
and St. Mary’s River area. Goal is always to look for federal funding opportunities.



Community Rating System Program
The goal of the Federal CRS Program is to encourage, by the use of flood insurance premium
adjustments, Fort Wayne outreach activities beyond those required by the NFIP, saving citizens
10% a year on flood insurance premiums.



Upgraded Early Flood Warning System
The Flood Control Department expanded its early flood warning system from 16 to 32 sites. The
data from this system is critical to the National Weather Service for flood watches, warnings and
crest predictions during a flood. This system was designed to be used by other City
Departments, outside agencies and smaller communities in this area. Flood Control has
budgeted to maintain the 32 sites to continue communicating as designed and for additional
sensors to be added to the system for its expanded use.

TRANSPORTATION ADMINISTRATION & SUPPORT
The functions of this group are varied, and generally fall within three department subsets: a
surveying-drafting-inspection group; a permit and plan review group; and a finance-administrative
group.
Department staff provides surveying, drafting, and inspection services necessary for the
successful completion of street, curb, and sidewalk projects. Employees in this group also
assess and report on pavement condition in order to maintain and update our pavement
management system.
Other employees in this department are responsible for fielding a variety of other customer
service requests, responses, and interactions. These responsibilities include permit functions;
plan review of developer projects; investigation and reporting functions; data base maintenance
activities; blueprint reproduction services; right of way acquisition functions; and general customer
service activities.
Department personnel also provide financial management, budgeting, purchasing, payroll, and
clerical support services needed within the Transportation division.

Objectives:


provide surveying, drafting, and inspection services to insure adherence to specifications, to
insure contract compliance, and to facilitate completion of neighborhood capital projects



maintain and update the Pavement Management System, in compliance with GASB 34
reporting requirements



respond to all citizens requests falling within our jurisdiction
Department personnel respond to citizen requests such as removing vegetation obstructions,
policing construction sites, enforcing sign restrictions, requiring snow removal, investigating
reported hazards and infrastructure failures, assisting with locating property lines,
determining project feasibility, and a variety of other requests.



insure that all excavations in the rights-of-way are properly restored
Staff closely monitors the permit restoration process to try and insure that cuts are
permanently restored within a timely fashion.



insure that all non-City funded construction occurring in the rights-of-way adheres to City
engineering standards and specifications
The department issues drive approach permits, sidewalk permits, and parking lot permits, to
insure that City standards are followed. Multiple Inspections are performed during the permit
review process, during construction, and upon completion.



insure that temporary restrictions and/or street closures are properly barricaded with
appropriate warning signs and traffic control devices
These permits are used to insure that proper and safe signing occurs whenever an
obstruction is present within the traveled way.

94

TRANSPORTATION ADMINISTRATION & SUPPORT Continued


facilitate project planning by providing meaningful, appropriate, and accurate financial data to
public works decision makers and insure that the project bidding process, requisition process,
and project close-out process follows established procedures and guidelines
Major funds, budgets, and programs tracked include the MVH fund, LR&S fund, CEDIT fund,
infrastructure bond funds, neighborhood capital improvement funds, and federal highway
grant funds. Department staff provides clerical and administrative support for a host of
activities relating to transportation capital improvements.



Timely perform necessary right of way acquisitions in advance of planned construction so as
to not delay anticipated construction commencement dates



timely process all construction project payables and receivables
Department staff strives to have vendors paid within 30 days of the vendor’s invoice date,
including mailing time.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management identifies, assesses, and prioritizes the various risks within the operation of the City
with the clear goal of loss prevention. We utilize the internal and external resources available to us to
minimize, monitor, control and ideally, to prevent loss. This includes legal liabilities which come in the
form of tort claims against the City, Workers Compensation and Hurt on Duty claims by injured workers,
and assuring adequate insurance coverage for all City assets and general liability and police professional
claims.
The City of Fort Wayne has been self-insured for General, Auto, and Police Professional Liabilities since
an ordinance was passed in 1989 establishing the self-insurance fund. Then in 1991, an additional
ordinance was passed establishing the Workers Compensation Fund. All costs for the operating budget
of Risk Management, actuarial costs to maintain proper funding for the General Fund, third party
expenses for Workers Compensation claims processing and loss control are from the fund.
The five-person team includes two Safety Claims Investigators to attend motor vehicle accidents involving
City employees and to perform inspections and investigations to assure OSHA compliance. Members of
the team monitor and maintain the tort claim process, the City’s drug screening process, safety training of
City employees, handling of Workers Comp and Hurt on Duty injuries, as well as maintaining records of
employees training, physicals (CDL, Confined Space, Post Offer and Workability exams) and
immunizations. We also participate in interdepartmental groups such as FMLA and insurance
committees, and ADA Coordinator duties. This continual monitoring and management for these functions
in all City departments provides excellent stewardship of taxpayers’ money.

STREET DEPARTMENT
Mission Statement
The primary mission of the Street Department is to provide the citizens of Fort Wayne with a wellmaintained and safe transportation infrastructure. We strive to render cost effective, competent service
including snow removal, street resurfacing, leaf pick-up, street sweeping and overall street maintenance.

Goals and Objectives
Pothole response time remains a top priority for the department, maintaining an average response time of
less than three hours. Paving, and chip and seal resurfacing remain top priorities where our summer
construction season is concerned. In 2015 we plan to pave 12 miles of city streets and complete 10 miles
of chip and seal resurfacing. Throughout the summer months, we also provide several other city services
such as street sweeping, alley maintenance, right of way mowing and crack sealing.
The winter of 2013/14 proved to be among one of the worst our city has experienced with a total snowfall
accumulation of 59.4 inches (National Weather Service). This comes in a very close second only to
1981/82 when we had 61.1 inches. Snow fighting efforts included the use of approximately 20,000 tons of
road salt and more than 32,000 collective hours of overtime department-wide.
In 2014, we purchased a new crack seal pouring machine, replacing our old one which was more than ten
years old. This purchase brings improved operator efficiency to a program that helps to preserve our
street paving investment. We now also incorporate four heated asphalt trailers that we use throughout the
city. These allow us to keep our asphalt hot throughout the day, regardless of the temperature outside,
giving us much higher efficiency with respect to the “shelf life” of the material, as well as our response
time. They are also excellent for “cold mix” in the winter months, making the material much more pliable in
extreme temperatures for better applications, increasing patch durability.
In recent years, we have significantly escalated our level of service towards helping to maintain the Fort
Wayne Trails system. We provide for the cutback of vegetation and trees, garbage removal, grass cutting,
carpentry work on bridges and decks, repaving, and trail rebuilding as required by floods whenever
necessary. This goes a long way to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all who utilize the trails whether
they walk, run, or ride their bicycles.
Our leaf program is working well and we are again prepared to collect more than 5,000 truckloads or,
roughly 20,000 tons of leaves this year. We will also collect all bagged leaves reported to the 311 call
center within 2 business days. Throughout the winter, we strive to keep the city streets clear of snow and
ice to ensure safe travel for motorists.

TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING SERVICES:
Street Project Management
Mission Statement
Street Project Management is a department within the Division of Public Works, Transportation Engineering
section. The mission of the Street Project Management Department is to plan, design and implement the
construction and repair of a safe and efficient transportation system within the City of Fort Wayne.
The City Engineer directs the Street Project Management section of Transportation Engineering. The duty of
the City Engineer is to oversee the preparation of plans and specifications for the competitive bidding of
Capital Improvement Programs, Public Works Maintenance projects requiring engineering expertise and all
other improvement projects necessary for the safe, efficient and economical operation of the Public Works
Division of the City of Fort Wayne government.

Goals and Objectives


Plan, design, and construct neighborhood projects in the year they are planned for construction.

It’s important to fulfill commitments for street, curb and walk improvements in the year those commitments
were made. This will be accomplished by beginning the design process earlier once projects have been
selected. This goal will strengthen our customer’s confidence in our services. In 2014, our project teams will
have designed and/or managed roughly $20 million in transportation related projects. Our customers are the
citizens of Fort Wayne and their designated government representatives.


Maintain and update the Pavement Management System.

Keeping this database up to date will ensure we are concentrating on the infrastructure that needs the most
attention. The Pavement Management System will also help determine from year to year how well we are
accomplishing our goals and whether those goals should be re-evaluated. We update our system by
reassessing at least 1/3 of our total miles each year.
This system is our tracking device to measure our success in improving the pavement condition citywide. The
overall system condition in 2013 was rated in the “Good” condition category.
Our customers; the engineers, planners, government representatives, and the citizens of Fort Wayne, are
important to us and together we depend on this information to make sound decisions about Transportation
projects. Street Project management will



Assist the Street Maintenance Department in our calculated goal of asphalt resurfacing of 52 miles
of asphalt roads and streets through contracted services.
Repair or reconstruct in our calculated goal of 10 miles of concrete streets through contracted
services.

It’s imperative to keep up with the pace of deterioration our infrastructure experiences each year. We have
determined these are miles of pavement that must be improved upon to keep the overall system condition in
the “Good” condition level. To meet our established goals, appropriate funding must be dedicated
towards transportation related infrastructure.
If we can provide a well-maintained transportation system, businesses will be attracted to Fort Wayne and
ultimately create new jobs. A well maintained system will also reduce our liability from accidents stemming
from poor pavement condition. Our customers are the citizens of Fort Wayne who expect a safe and reliable
transportation system.

DEPARTMENT OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
The Department of Weights & Measures mission is that of ensuring equity in the marketplace for both
merchants and consumers. The department is responsible for the testing and inspection of all commercial
weighing and measuring devices, enforcing the City Ordinance regarding taxicab operations, enforcing the
City Weights and Measures Ordinance, and enforcing State Codes governing Weights and Measures.
The principal duty of our Department is to test, certify, and seal correct devices, or order correction of and/or
condemn or confiscate faulty devices or commodities offered for sale by weight or count.
In our 2013-2014 reporting year, 13,382 inspections were performed.
2015 Goals

1.

The primary goal for Weights & Measures is to continue our efforts of ensuring equity in the
marketplace. The importance of ensuring the accuracy of weighing and measuring devices can best
be illustrated by example:


2.

A Deli scale that weighs 1 oz. over or under weight (with an assumed average of 100 purchases per
day @ $2.00 per pound) will result in a $4,500+ annual loss for the business or their customers.
A single gasoline pump that delivers 5 cubic inches (about 5 tablespoons) per gallon over or under
volume (with assumed average sales) can result in a $5,000+ annual loss for the business or their
customers.
To ensure continuing commitment to our primary goal, and in a culture of ever evolving standards
and devices, currency in training must be maintained. It is therefore our goal to use every
opportunity to seek out cost effective training. Correct, consistent, and fair enforcement of weights
and measures laws require both initial and continuing education of inspectors, and it is our goal to
stay current with course materials available to us through our membership in the National
Conference of Weights and Measures.
