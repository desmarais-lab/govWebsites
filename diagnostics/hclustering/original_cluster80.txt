Background on Marion County COIT Homestead Credit
Under IC 6-3.5-6, Marion County currently imposes a county option income tax (COIT) of 1%. The COIT taxing
option was made available by the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1980’s to provide diversification to the
revenue base of civil units of government. The revenue raised from the COIT is distributed to non-school taxing
units as prescribed by statute, and in the form of property tax relief to homeowners. The COIT property tax relief
component is known as the “Homestead Credit,” and in 2013, comprises $12.5M of the total $169M COIT
distribution to Marion County (7.4%).
The COIT homestead credit was instituted by the City County Council to complement the forms of property tax
relief already provided by the State at that time: the property tax replacement credit (PTRC) and the state
homestead credit. In 2008, the Indiana General Assembly enacted a wide range of property tax reforms. These
reforms eliminated the state PTRC, phased out the state homestead credit, and instituted a new series of rate caps
(known as “circuit breakers”) as the predominant form of property tax controls. These rate caps have since been
embodied in the Indiana Constitution.
A homestead is a special subclass of residential property under Indiana law – defined as an owner-occupied
permanent dwelling. An individual taxpayer can only claim homestead status on one property – the home in which
they claim as their primary residence. Rental homes, apartments and second homes are not eligible for the
homestead classification. The COIT homestead credit operates as a discount on a homestead property owner’s tax
bill (about 4%). The homeowner’s gross tax (net assessed value multiplied by tax rate) is discounted by the
homestead credit. If the resulting tax bill still exceeds the rate cap limit (1% of gross assessed value), then the tax
bill is further reduced until this maximum liability is reached.
The COIT homestead credit, to which this memo refers, is a different property tax relief mechanism than what are
commonly known as homestead deductions (the standard and the supplemental deductions). These deductions,
which provide substantially more property tax relief to taxpayers are in effect statewide, and are not local policy
choices.

The 2008 property tax reforms significantly altered the framework in which local fiscal policy decisions are made.
While the reforms reduced individual tax liabilities and made tax bills more consistent and predictable, the rate
caps resulted in reduced revenue and increased fiscal uncertainty for local governmental units. In 2013, the circuit
breaker rate caps reduce property tax net levies in Marion County by $158.7M (or 13%).

The altered mechanics of post-circuit breaker property taxation, and the fiscal challenges created by the circuit
breaker have necessitated a re-evaluation of the fiscal policies and assumptions that were in place in the precircuit breaker era. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impacts to both taxing units and taxpayers of
eliminating the COIT homestead credit in Marion County.

Taxpayers: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
For taxpayers, the implications of eliminating the homestead credit are complicated by the interactions of the
circuit breaker credit. The 2008 property tax reform instituted a rate cap (circuit breaker) of 1% of gross assessed
value for homestead property (except for property taxes related to a voter approved referendum – as explained
below). Because of the circuit breaker rate cap, eliminating the homestead credit will affect properties differently
– depending on assessed value, eligible deductions, and the prevailing property tax rate. The impacts can be
broadly summarized into three situations – though there are cases where more than one situation will apply to a
particular parcel.
Case A: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes no liability impact
The elimination of the homestead credit will have no impact on the non-referendum tax liability for
taxpayers who are already at the circuit breaker limit (net property tax liability is greater than 1% of
gross assessed value). These taxpayers are already paying their maximum property tax liability and
their tax bill would not increase as a result of the homestead credit elimination. For these taxpayers,
the effects of the COIT homestead credit elimination would be borne by the taxing units in the form
of reduced property tax collections, and not by the taxpayers themselves.

Case B: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes increased tax liability to non-referendum
taxes
Homeowners who are not yet at the circuit breaker rate cap would see increased tax bills if the COIT
homestead credit is eliminated. Because the tax liabilities for these parcels are not yet equal to 1% of
the homestead’s gross assessed value, there is still room for tax bills to increase before the circuit
breaker protection kicks in. For these taxpayers, property tax bills could increase by up to
approximately 4%, or until the net liability exceeds 1% of gross assessed value, whichever comes first.
The following table describes an example of a case in which the elimination of the homestead credit
causes an increase in tax liability – but the increase is mitigated by the circuit breaker rate cap. In this
case, the elimination of the homestead credit pushes the tax liability above the circuit breaker
maximum, so the impact is shared between the taxpayer and taxing units.

Case C: The elimination of the homestead credit causes an increase to the liability resulting from a
voter approved referendum.
Tax rates for school capital projects or school operating funding that were approved by voter
referenda are exempt from the circuit breaker credit. Currently, these circuit breaker exempt rates
have been approved in the IPS, Beech Grove, Speedway, Washington Township, Perry Township, and
Pike Township school districts. The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would result in an
increase (approximately 4%) to the portion of the property taxes resulting from the referendum
process. This increase would apply to all homeowners with a referendum-approved tax rate,
regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is already at the circuit breaker rate cap. An illustration of
the impact of eliminating the COIT homestead credit on a taxpayer subject to the referendum rate is
shown below.

The effects of eliminating the COIT homestead credit vary based on location and property value. The impacts to
specific areas and classes of taxpayers are summarized in the findings, tables and maps that follow.

Taxing Units: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
The Marion County COIT homestead credit is currently set at approximately 4% of a homestead’s gross liability
(defined as net assessed value times gross tax rate). In 2014, approximately $12.8M in COIT revenue will be
directed to homestead property tax relief. Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would have two effects on local
taxing units, which are explained below. First, general COIT distributions freed up from the homestead credit will
be shifted to civil units’ budgets. Secondly, the circuit breaker rate caps will bite more deeply into all unit’s net
property tax revenue, as more taxpayers reach the circuit breaker limit (see table on page 9).
1.

Eliminating COIT homestead credit would result in some property tax revenue reduction for all
taxing units.
Removing the COIT homestead credit would lead to an increase in effective property tax rates
countywide. In general, as tax rates increase, taxing units lose more revenue to the circuit breaker
rate caps. As the COIT homestead credit is removed, the tax liability applicable for the 1% circuit
breaker rate cap would increase. This increase in homestead circuit breaker impact would cause a
reduction in revenue for taxing units. This impact would apply to all taxing units – since all taxing
units have homestead parcels in their tax base, regardless of their eligibility to receive additional COIT
revenue.

2.

Eliminating the homestead credit would increase revenue to some taxing units by shifting COIT
revenue that is currently being applied as homestead credits to general certified shares (revenue
distributed to taxing units for any budgeted purpose).
In Marion County, the only units eligible to receive increases in COIT distributions are the Marion
County taxing unit, the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, and
the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport and Speedway. Upon the elimination of the COIT
homestead credit, the COIT distributions to these units would increase by a combined $12.8M (see
table on page 9). Units that are not eligible to receive additional COIT distributions will not see any
revenue increase resulting from the elimination of the COIT homestead credit.

The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would, after the property tax losses described above are taken into
account, provide for a net increase in the total revenue available to Marion County taxing units. For taxing units
that are eligible for an increase in their COIT distribution, the added COIT revenue would be greater than the losses
due to the circuit breaker. For taxing units that are not eligible for an increased COIT distribution, the elimination
of the COIT homestead credit would cause a reduction in revenue. The table below shows, in summary, these two
revenue outcomes.

Summary
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would result in revenue increases for nine taxing units, totaling
approximately $9M. It would result in revenue decreases of $5.3M to other taxing units within the
County. The elimination of the homestead credit would result in a net increase in local government
revenue available to all taxing units within the County of, in sum, $3.8M.

2.

Approximately 25% of homestead property tax owners would experience no change in property tax
liability due to the elimination of the COIT homestead credit. Approximately 18% would experience no
change in non-referendum taxes (the only increase, if any, would be in voter approved referendum
funds). Approximately 57% of taxpayers would see an increase in non-referendum tax liability.

THE COUNCIL
CITY OF INDIANAPOLIS AND MARION COUNTY
200 EAST WASHINGTON STREET ∙ INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA 46204 ∙ PHONE: (317) 327-4242

July 16, 2013
The Honorable Maggie A. Lewis
President
City-County Council of Indianapolis and Marion County
241 City-County Building
200 E. Washington Street
Indianapolis, Indiana 46204
Dear President Lewis,
In accordance with City-County Council Proposal 121, 2013, we are pleased to present to you the enclosed Report
of the Marion County Local Homestead Credit Review Commission (Homestead Commission). The report
summarizes the discussion and findings of the Homestead Commission. Additional details such as meeting
minutes and other supplemental data can be found on the Commission web page.
The Local Homestead Credit Review Commission is a bi-partisan study group that was enacted by City-County
Council Proposal 121, and appointed jointly by the Council and the Mayor, to review the Local Homestead Credit
and the potential impact of its elimination. The Commission, which consists of ten members, and two co-chairs,
no more than one from the same political party, had the following objectives:





Educate the community about the homestead credit;
Review the implications and effects of the local homestead credit on the budgets of all property tax
supported units;
Receive public input on these decisions;
Make a recommendation to the Council based on findings.

The Commission held seven public meetings in various locations throughout the community to ensure all
members of the public had the opportunity to attend and participate in public discussion about the Local
Homestead Credit.
We would personally like to thank all members of the Commission as they have devoted their time and
knowledge throughout the entire process. This would not have been possible without their diligence and
dedication to the Commission. We would also like to acknowledge members of the public and representatives of
various county, civil and school taxing units for their participation in the process and contribution to the
community dialogue.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as co-chairs of this initiative. It has been our pleasure to lead the process
and we hope that the results will be useful to the decision making process in the upcoming budget and beyond.

Sincerely,

Beth Henkel
Co-Chair

Background and Introduction
The Local Homestead Credit Review Commission is a ten-member, bi-partisan study group
appointed through joint agreement between the Indianapolis-Marion County City-County
Council and the Mayor. The Commission was enacted by Council Resolution Proposal No. 121,
2013 (Council Resolution No. 48, 2013). The objectives of the commission are as follows:





Educate the community about the local homestead credit (LHC);
Review the effects of possible elimination on the budgets of all property tax supported
units;
Receive public input on the issues and impacts regarding possible elimination;
Make recommendations to the City County Council regarding whether to maintain,
eliminate, or phase out the LHC;

To meet its responsibilities, the Commission



Held seven public meetings in various locations around the county;
Established a website that contains information, analyses and presentations regarding
the LHC. It also provides taxpayers a means to find out what the potential effect would
be on their bills if the LHC were eliminated.

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission: Report of Proceedings and Recommendations

City-County Fiscal Condition/Effects of Eliminating the Local Homestead Credit
One of the considerations in reviewing the effects of eliminating the LHC is the potential effect
on the City-County budget. Regarding the City-County financial condition and the fiscal
challenges the city and county face, the Commission found that:




Page 3

Income tax revenue to the City/County has declined by a cumulative $164 million since
2010, from a high of $268 million to $209 million in 2013.
Property tax revenue has remained flat, or slightly declined since 2008.
Average net property tax revenue per year from 2008 to 2014 (est.) is $240 million.
Therefore, as to the major sources of revenue for City/County government -- have seen
a decline in general fund revenues of $64 million from 2010, with cumulative decline
over that period of $180 million.
At the same time, general fund expenses have not declined substantially, despite
several measures taken to cut spending.
By far the majority of expenses are in public safety and criminal justice expenditures, a
total of $507 million in 2012 (88% of budget); $530 million in the 2013 budget (89%).
As a result of these ongoing declines in revenue, general fund balances have declined.
o For 2013, the Controller’s office reported a structural deficit of $62.3 million,
with general fund balance estimated to be $26.2 million by the end of 2013.
o For 2014, if no actions are taken, the projected deficit is $55.5 million, with a
yearend GF balance in the red, at -$29.3 million.
Elimination of the LHC would not solve the city/county’s deficit.
o For 2014, an estimated $12.8 million of County Option Income Tax (“COIT”)
receipts would be set aside for LHC.
o Essentially take $12.8 million of funds that would otherwise be distributed to the
City, County, excluded cities and towns and certain township units and put that
money in the property tax bucket to offset property taxes otherwise due from
homestead owners – thereby distributing COIT funds to schools and other units,
like IndyGo, the library, and Health and Hospital, that generally do not receive
COIT.
o Only $3.8 million of the $12.8 million LHC actually provides property tax relief to
homeowners.
o Elimination of the LHC would provide the City/County with a net increase of $8.3
million in potential ongoing revenue.
o Elimination of the LHC would also increase effective property tax rates and
increase the circuit breaker loss to taxing units that do not receive COIT -- towns,
schools, and municipal corporations by $5.3 million.

July 16, 2013

Local Homestead Credit Review Commission: Report of Proceedings and Recommendations

In our review of the effect that elimination would have on taxpayers in the county, we found
that:
o Of 220,000 homesteads in the county, elimination of the LHC would have no
effect on 56,000 homesteads– approximately one-quarter of all homesteads.
o If the LHC were eliminated, the property tax increase for 81% of Marion County
homeowners would be less than $30.
o For any one homestead, the maximum increase would not be more than 3.6%.
o The overall impact would be greatest on homeowners in areas of the county that
have low tax rates, or that have lower assessed values.
Proceedings Regarding the Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit
After these meetings and gathering additional information, the Commission met on June 24 to
vote on its recommendations regarding elimination of the LHC and also on making other
recommendations that the Commission had regarding ways to address the City/County deficit.
Nine members of the commission attended this meeting, with one member sending a proxy.
The members expressed concern for taxpayers whose bills would increase, even minimally, in
these difficult times.
The majority of members also expressed concern on behalf of the taxing units that would lose
revenue as a result of the elimination of the HSC.
Five members voted in favor of phasing out funding over a two-year period. Four members
voted in favor of retaining current funding.
The proxy member voted for a phase out, but that vote has not been counted, as General
Counsel has advised that the rules pertaining to the participation of proxies do not permit the
proxy to vote. Because the Commission rules require a vote of six members to approve
recommendations, the vote was inconclusive regarding a recommendation to rescind the Local
Homestead Credit.
While there was no conclusive Commission recommendation, there will be council
consideration of eliminating the Local Homestead Credit.
On July 8, Proposal 187, 2013 was submitted to the City-County Council, proposing a resolution
of the Marion County Income Tax Council, under IC 6-3.5-6-1.5 and IC 6-3.5-6-13, to reduce the
local homestead credit to 4% for calendar year 2014 and to rescind the local homestead credit
beginning in calendar year 2015. Proposal 187 has been assigned to the Administration and
Finance Committee. Final action is scheduled to be taken by July 29, before the Controller
submits the proposed 2014 budget to the City-County Council in August.

Other Recommendations
As a result of Commission deliberation and public inquiry, the Commission also considered
other recommendations that could assist with the financial issues raised in consideration of the
LHC. In all, there were seven additional recommendations:
1. All members voted in favor of continuing City/County efficiency efforts to reduce
spending.
2. All members also favored appropriating existing funds from taxes collected for the
Auditor’s Office to complete the homestead exemption review process and
recommended a change in State law to permit the excess funds collected to be returned
to local units of government. Through the Ineligible Homestead Program, the County
Auditor has collected more than $2 million from taxpayers who improperly received the
homestead designation.
3. Eight of nine members recommended that additional funding be provided to the
Assessor’s Office to resolve the pending backlogs of appeals in a fair and equitable
manner.
4. Eight of nine members voted in favor of implementing a TIF Assessed Value passthrough policy to insure continuity in the reduction of the circuit breaker loss to local
units of government.
5. Seven members voted in favor of further review of whether the County Income Tax
Council (CITC) should phase in and increase the Public Safety COIT rate to provide
additional funding for Public Safety staffing and operational needs. Two voted against
any increase.
6. Six members voted in favor of further review by the CITC of increasing the Local Option
Income Tax (LOIT) levy freeze rate to provide proper funding for local units of
government that had their levies frozen for three years; two voted in favor of
recommending increasing the rate and one disagreed with any increase.
7. Five members favored providing COIT funding to Library and Indy-Go to cover any net
funding loss due to HSC change and/or LOIT levy freeze rate change; three additional
members voted for further review of this issue; one disagreed with any additional
funding to offset the revenue losses.

Impact on Fund Balance
•

Little to no growth in major revenue sources place a burden on lowering
expenditures and depleting fund balances.

•

Even with one‐time revenue sources and reductions in expenditures during
2013, a structural deficit will occur.
– The structural deficit is based expected expenditures for a given year, net
of total revenue for a given year, adjusted for one‐time
revenue/expenditures or anticipated future revenue/expenditures.
While overall general fund expenditures have increased over the last 5 years,
an increase in public safety and criminal justice services have created
additional pressure on the annual budget.

•

•

Actions have been taken to address stagnant revenues by reducing
expenditures where possible, drawing down fund balances and identifying
potential revenue sources both ongoing and one‐time.

City/County General Fund Impact
2013 and 2014 Est. ($’s in millions)

9

Impact of Homestead Credit
• Currently: $12.5M of county option income tax (COIT) is set aside
for Local Homestead Credit
• Increased expenditures and stagnant tax revenues has created a
structural deficit and potential general fund cash reserve issue
• Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit would provide the
city/county with almost $8.3M in potential on‐going revenue
without an increase in income taxes
• Creates minimal impact on property taxes (below the cap or part of a
referendum)

• Elimination of the Local Homestead Credit is not a “silver bullet”
– However, this is one option to address the structural deficit and
general fund cash reserves

Overview of COIT
1.

COIT is the County Option Income Tax. It was adopted in the
1980’s. COIT is one of three types of local income tax imposed
in Marion County.

2.

COIT is spendable revenue for civil units of government to be
used for any valid budgeted purpose.

3.

The COIT homestead credit was established at the time COIT
was enacted.

4.

In 2013, $12.5M of Marion County’s $169M COIT distribution
was used to replace a portion of homestead property tax levies.

5.

This amount gets distributed as property taxes to all units in the
county that are able to levy property taxes.

2

Overview of the COIT
Homestead Credit
1. Currently, $12.5M of the $169M Marion County COIT distribution is
allocated as a homestead credit for Marion County homeowners.
2. A “homestead” is defined by Indiana law as an owner-occupied permanent
dwelling. An individual can only claim homestead status on one property
– the home in which they claim primary residence.
3. The COIT Homestead Credit is not the same as the “Homestead
Deduction.” The homestead deductions are administered by the State,
and are not local policy decisions.
4. Marion County has an additional small homestead credit – the LOIT (local
option income tax) homestead credit, which is not part of this discussion.
5. COIT Homestead Credits “become” property tax revenue by virtue of
replacing a portion of the property taxes that residential taxpayers would
otherwise pay.
ff

3

Impact of Eliminating the HSC on
Taxing Units
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit in 2014 will shift
approximately $12.8M in COIT dollars from property tax
substitution to spendable general revenues for certain civil
units (certified shares).

2.

This change increases effective property tax rates. The
result is a reduction in property tax collections for all
taxing units as taxpayers are moved further above the
circuit breaker rate caps.

3.

Additional COIT dollars, freed up from the homestead
credit will shift to those civil units that are eligible to
receive COIT distributions according to current law.

Descriptive Analysis of the Elimination of the
COIT Homestead Credit in Marion County
Impacts to Taxpayers and Taxing Units

Prepared for the:
Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

By:
Policy Analytics, LLC

May 28, 2013

Background on Marion County COIT Homestead Credit
Under IC 6-3.5-6, Marion County currently imposes a county option income tax (COIT) of 1%. The COIT taxing
option was made available by the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1980’s to provide diversification to the
revenue base of civil units of government. The revenue raised from the COIT is distributed to non-school taxing
units as prescribed by statute, and in the form of property tax relief to homeowners. The COIT property tax relief
component is known as the “Homestead Credit,” and in 2013, comprises $12.5M of the total $169M COIT
distribution to Marion County (7.4%).
The COIT homestead credit was instituted by the City County Council to complement the forms of property tax
relief already provided by the State at that time: the property tax replacement credit (PTRC) and the state
homestead credit. In 2008, the Indiana General Assembly enacted a wide range of property tax reforms. These
reforms eliminated the state PTRC, phased out the state homestead credit, and instituted a new series of rate caps
(known as “circuit breakers”) as the predominant form of property tax controls. These rate caps have since been
embodied in the Indiana Constitution.
A homestead is a special subclass of residential property under Indiana law – defined as an owner-occupied
permanent dwelling. An individual taxpayer can only claim homestead status on one property – the home in which
they claim as their primary residence. Rental homes, apartments and second homes are not eligible for the
homestead classification. The COIT homestead credit operates as a discount on a homestead property owner’s tax
bill (about 4%). The homeowner’s gross tax (net assessed value multiplied by tax rate) is discounted by the
homestead credit. If the resulting tax bill still exceeds the rate cap limit (1% of gross assessed value), then the tax
bill is further reduced until this maximum liability is reached.
The COIT homestead credit, to which this memo refers, is a different property tax relief mechanism than what are
commonly known as homestead deductions (the standard and the supplemental deductions). These deductions,
which provide substantially more property tax relief to taxpayers are in effect statewide, and are not local policy
choices.

The 2008 property tax reforms significantly altered the framework in which local fiscal policy decisions are made.
While the reforms reduced individual tax liabilities and made tax bills more consistent and predictable, the rate
caps resulted in reduced revenue and increased fiscal uncertainty for local governmental units. In 2013, the circuit
breaker rate caps reduce property tax net levies in Marion County by $158.7M (or 13%).

The altered mechanics of post-circuit breaker property taxation, and the fiscal challenges created by the circuit
breaker have necessitated a re-evaluation of the fiscal policies and assumptions that were in place in the precircuit breaker era. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impacts to both taxing units and taxpayers of
eliminating the COIT homestead credit in Marion County.

Taxpayers: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
For taxpayers, the implications of eliminating the homestead credit are complicated by the interactions of the
circuit breaker credit. The 2008 property tax reform instituted a rate cap (circuit breaker) of 1% of gross assessed
value for homestead property (except for property taxes related to a voter approved referendum – as explained
below). Because of the circuit breaker rate cap, eliminating the homestead credit will affect properties differently
– depending on assessed value, eligible deductions, and the prevailing property tax rate. The impacts can be
broadly summarized into three situations – though there are cases where more than one situation will apply to a
particular parcel.
Case A: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes no liability impact
The elimination of the homestead credit will have no impact on the non-referendum tax liability for
taxpayers who are already at the circuit breaker limit (net property tax liability is greater than 1% of
gross assessed value). These taxpayers are already paying their maximum property tax liability and
their tax bill would not increase as a result of the homestead credit elimination. For these taxpayers,
the effects of the COIT homestead credit elimination would be borne by the taxing units in the form
of reduced property tax collections, and not by the taxpayers themselves.

analysis.

Case B: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes increased tax liability to non-referendum
taxes
Homeowners who are not yet at the circuit breaker rate cap would see increased tax bills if the COIT
homestead credit is eliminated. Because the tax liabilities for these parcels are not yet equal to 1% of
the homestead’s gross assessed value, there is still room for tax bills to increase before the circuit
breaker protection kicks in. For these taxpayers, property tax bills could increase by up to
approximately 4%, or until the net liability exceeds 1% of gross assessed value, whichever comes first.
The following table describes an example of a case in which the elimination of the homestead credit
causes an increase in tax liability – but the increase is mitigated by the circuit breaker rate cap. In this
case, the elimination of the homestead credit pushes the tax liability above the circuit breaker
maximum, so the impact is shared between the taxpayer and taxing units.

Case C: The elimination of the homestead credit causes an increase to the liability resulting from a
voter approved referendum.
Tax rates for school capital projects or school operating funding that were approved by voter
referenda are exempt from the circuit breaker credit. Currently, these circuit breaker exempt rates
have been approved in the IPS, Beech Grove, Speedway, Washington Township, Perry Township, and
Pike Township school districts. The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would result in an
increase (approximately 4%) to the portion of the property taxes resulting from the referendum
process. This increase would apply to all homeowners with a referendum-approved tax rate,
regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is already at the circuit breaker rate cap. An illustration of
the impact of eliminating the COIT homestead credit on a taxpayer subject to the referendum rate is
shown below.

The effects of eliminating the COIT homestead credit vary based on location and property value. The impacts to
specific areas and classes of taxpayers are summarized in the findings, tables and maps that follow.

Taxing Units: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
The Marion County COIT homestead credit is currently set at approximately 4% of a homestead’s gross liability
(defined as net assessed value times gross tax rate). In 2014, approximately $12.8M in COIT revenue will be
directed to homestead property tax relief. Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would have two effects on local
taxing units, which are explained below. First, general COIT distributions freed up from the homestead credit will
be shifted to civil units’ budgets. Secondly, the circuit breaker rate caps will bite more deeply into all unit’s net
property tax revenue, as more taxpayers reach the circuit breaker limit (see table on page 9).
1.

Eliminating COIT homestead credit would result in some property tax revenue reduction for all
taxing units.
Removing the COIT homestead credit would lead to an increase in effective property tax rates
countywide. In general, as tax rates increase, taxing units lose more revenue to the circuit breaker
rate caps. As the COIT homestead credit is removed, the tax liability applicable for the 1% circuit
breaker rate cap would increase. This increase in homestead circuit breaker impact would cause a
reduction in revenue for taxing units. This impact would apply to all taxing units – since all taxing
units have homestead parcels in their tax base, regardless of their eligibility to receive additional COIT
revenue.

2.

Eliminating the homestead credit would increase revenue to some taxing units by shifting COIT
revenue that is currently being applied as homestead credits to general certified shares (revenue
distributed to taxing units for any budgeted purpose).
In Marion County, the only units eligible to receive increases in COIT distributions are the Marion
County taxing unit, the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, and
the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport and Speedway. Upon the elimination of the COIT
homestead credit, the COIT distributions to these units would increase by a combined $12.8M (see
table on page 9). Units that are not eligible to receive additional COIT distributions will not see any
revenue increase resulting from the elimination of the COIT homestead credit.

The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would, after the property tax losses described above are taken into
account, provide for a net increase in the total revenue available to Marion County taxing units. For taxing units
that are eligible for an increase in their COIT distribution, the added COIT revenue would be greater than the losses
due to the circuit breaker. For taxing units that are not eligible for an increased COIT distribution, the elimination
of the COIT homestead credit would cause a reduction in revenue. The table below shows, in summary, these two
revenue outcomes.

Taxing Unit

Net Impact of Homestead Credit Elmination

12,781,421

Summary
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would result in revenue increases for nine taxing units, totaling
approximately $9M. It would result in revenue decreases of $5.3M to other taxing units within the
County. The elimination of the homestead credit would result in a net increase in local government
revenue available to all taxing units within the County of, in sum, $3.8M.

2.

Approximately 25% of homestead property tax owners would experience no change in property tax
liability due to the elimination of the COIT homestead credit. Approximately 18% would experience no
change in non-referendum taxes (the only increase, if any, would be in voter approved referendum
funds). Approximately 57% of taxpayers would see an increase in non-referendum tax liability.

3.

The median tax bill impact (including voter approved referenda) to taxpayers at various property values is
as follows:

Descriptive Analysis of the Elimination of the
COIT Homestead Credit in Marion County
Impacts to Taxpayers and Taxing Units

Prepared for the:
Local Homestead Credit Review Commission

By:
Policy Analytics, LLC

May 28, 2013

Background on Marion County COIT Homestead Credit
Under IC 6-3.5-6, Marion County currently imposes a county option income tax (COIT) of 1%. The COIT taxing
option was made available by the Indiana General Assembly in the early 1980’s to provide diversification to the
revenue base of civil units of government. The revenue raised from the COIT is distributed to non-school taxing
units as prescribed by statute, and in the form of property tax relief to homeowners. The COIT property tax relief
component is known as the “Homestead Credit,” and in 2013, comprises $12.5M of the total $169M COIT
distribution to Marion County (7.4%).
The COIT homestead credit was instituted by the City County Council to complement the forms of property tax
relief already provided by the State at that time: the property tax replacement credit (PTRC) and the state
homestead credit. In 2008, the Indiana General Assembly enacted a wide range of property tax reforms. These
reforms eliminated the state PTRC, phased out the state homestead credit, and instituted a new series of rate caps
(known as “circuit breakers”) as the predominant form of property tax controls. These rate caps have since been
embodied in the Indiana Constitution.
A homestead is a special subclass of residential property under Indiana law – defined as an owner-occupied
permanent dwelling. An individual taxpayer can only claim homestead status on one property – the home in which
they claim as their primary residence. Rental homes, apartments and second homes are not eligible for the
homestead classification. The COIT homestead credit operates as a discount on a homestead property owner’s tax
bill (about 4%). The homeowner’s gross tax (net assessed value multiplied by tax rate) is discounted by the
homestead credit. If the resulting tax bill still exceeds the rate cap limit (1% of gross assessed value), then the tax
bill is further reduced until this maximum liability is reached.
The COIT homestead credit, to which this memo refers, is a different property tax relief mechanism than what are
commonly known as homestead deductions (the standard and the supplemental deductions). These deductions,
which provide substantially more property tax relief to taxpayers are in effect statewide, and are not local policy
choices.

The 2008 property tax reforms significantly altered the framework in which local fiscal policy decisions are made.
While the reforms reduced individual tax liabilities and made tax bills more consistent and predictable, the rate
caps resulted in reduced revenue and increased fiscal uncertainty for local governmental units. In 2013, the circuit
breaker rate caps reduce property tax net levies in Marion County by $158.7M (or 13%).

The altered mechanics of post-circuit breaker property taxation, and the fiscal challenges created by the circuit
breaker have necessitated a re-evaluation of the fiscal policies and assumptions that were in place in the precircuit breaker era. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the impacts to both taxing units and taxpayers of
eliminating the COIT homestead credit in Marion County.

3 of 15

Taxpayers: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
For taxpayers, the implications of eliminating the homestead credit are complicated by the interactions of the
circuit breaker credit. The 2008 property tax reform instituted a rate cap (circuit breaker) of 1% of gross assessed
value for homestead property (except for property taxes related to a voter approved referendum – as explained
below). Because of the circuit breaker rate cap, eliminating the homestead credit will affect properties differently
– depending on assessed value, eligible deductions, and the prevailing property tax rate. The impacts can be
broadly summarized into three situations – though there are cases where more than one situation will apply to a
particular parcel.
Case A: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes no liability impact
The elimination of the homestead credit will have no impact on the non-referendum tax liability for
taxpayers who are already at the circuit breaker limit (net property tax liability is greater than 1% of
gross assessed value). These taxpayers are already paying their maximum property tax liability and
their tax bill would not increase as a result of the homestead credit elimination. For these taxpayers,
the effects of the COIT homestead credit elimination would be borne by the taxing units in the form
of reduced property tax collections, and not by the taxpayers themselves.

Case B: The elimination of the COIT homestead credit causes increased tax liability to non-referendum
taxes
Homeowners who are not yet at the circuit breaker rate cap would see increased tax bills if the COIT
homestead credit is eliminated. Because the tax liabilities for these parcels are not yet equal to 1% of
the homestead’s gross assessed value, there is still room for tax bills to increase before the circuit
breaker protection kicks in. For these taxpayers, property tax bills could increase by up to
approximately 4%, or until the net liability exceeds 1% of gross assessed value, whichever comes first.
The following table describes an example of a case in which the elimination of the homestead credit
causes an increase in tax liability – but the increase is mitigated by the circuit breaker rate cap. In this
case, the elimination of the homestead credit pushes the tax liability above the circuit breaker
maximum, so the impact is shared between the taxpayer and taxing units.

Case C: The elimination of the homestead credit causes an increase to the liability resulting from a
voter approved referendum.
Tax rates for school capital projects or school operating funding that were approved by voter
referenda are exempt from the circuit breaker credit. Currently, these circuit breaker exempt rates
have been approved in the IPS, Beech Grove, Speedway, Washington Township, Perry Township, and
Pike Township school districts. The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would result in an
increase (approximately 4%) to the portion of the property taxes resulting from the referendum
process. This increase would apply to all homeowners with a referendum-approved tax rate,
regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is already at the circuit breaker rate cap. An illustration of
the impact of eliminating the COIT homestead credit on a taxpayer subject to the referendum rate is
shown below.

The effects of eliminating the COIT homestead credit vary based on location and property value. The impacts to
specific areas and classes of taxpayers are summarized in the findings, tables and maps that follow.

Taxing Units: Impact of Eliminating the COIT Homestead Credit
The Marion County COIT homestead credit is currently set at approximately 4% of a homestead’s gross liability
(defined as net assessed value times gross tax rate). In 2014, approximately $12.8M in COIT revenue will be
directed to homestead property tax relief. Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would have two effects on local
taxing units, which are explained below. First, general COIT distributions freed up from the homestead credit will
be shifted to civil units’ budgets. Secondly, the circuit breaker rate caps will bite more deeply into all unit’s net
property tax revenue, as more taxpayers reach the circuit breaker limit (see table on page 9).
1.

Eliminating COIT homestead credit would result in some property tax revenue reduction for all
taxing units.
Removing the COIT homestead credit would lead to an increase in effective property tax rates
countywide. In general, as tax rates increase, taxing units lose more revenue to the circuit breaker
rate caps. As the COIT homestead credit is removed, the tax liability applicable for the 1% circuit
breaker rate cap would increase. This increase in homestead circuit breaker impact would cause a
reduction in revenue for taxing units. This impact would apply to all taxing units – since all taxing
units have homestead parcels in their tax base, regardless of their eligibility to receive additional COIT
revenue.

2.

Eliminating the homestead credit would increase revenue to some taxing units by shifting COIT
revenue that is currently being applied as homestead credits to general certified shares (revenue
distributed to taxing units for any budgeted purpose).
In Marion County, the only units eligible to receive increases in COIT distributions are the Marion
County taxing unit, the Consolidated City of Indianapolis, Decatur, Pike and Wayne Townships, and
the cities of Lawrence, Beech Grove, Southport and Speedway. Upon the elimination of the COIT
homestead credit, the COIT distributions to these units would increase by a combined $12.8M (see
table on page 9). Units that are not eligible to receive additional COIT distributions will not see any
revenue increase resulting from the elimination of the COIT homestead credit.

The elimination of the COIT homestead credit would, after the property tax losses described above are taken into
account, provide for a net increase in the total revenue available to Marion County taxing units. For taxing units
that are eligible for an increase in their COIT distribution, the added COIT revenue would be greater than the losses
due to the circuit breaker. For taxing units that are not eligible for an increased COIT distribution, the elimination
of the COIT homestead credit would cause a reduction in revenue. The table below shows, in summary, these two
revenue outcomes.

Summary
1.

Eliminating the COIT homestead credit would result in revenue increases for nine taxing units, totaling
approximately $9M. It would result in revenue decreases of $5.3M to other taxing units within the
County. The elimination of the homestead credit would result in a net increase in local government
revenue available to all taxing units within the County of, in sum, $3.8M.

2.

Approximately 25% of homestead property tax owners would experience no change in property tax
liability due to the elimination of the COIT homestead credit. Approximately 18% would experience no
change in non-referendum taxes (the only increase, if any, would be in voter approved referendum
funds). Approximately 57% of taxpayers would see an increase in non-referendum tax liability.
