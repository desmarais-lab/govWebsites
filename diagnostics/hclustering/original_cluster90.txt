ISA Report
Good Morning Board Members!


As we discussed in our February Working Board Meeting, we have a new IT Board Report
effective this month. The presentation is in your Board book but it will be displayed on the
overhead as well.



Enterprise Projects:
o We completed 1 project, 1 remains in Yellow Status and added 7 new projects.
o Office365 Email Upgrade: Final migrations were completed the last week of
January. Only small clean-up projects remain such as cleaning up resource
accounts, eliminating inactive accounts, adding IP addresses to the firewall and
returning any unused licenses.
o ERP Implementation: Financials Phase 2: iNovah has gone through the first
round of testing, and the ERP team is working on resolving identified issues. A
second round of testing will begin in the middle of March, and the final
implementation should be completed by March 31.
o Network Performance Assessment: As a part of the 2015 ISA capital plan,
pieces of the network infrastructure are being replaced in 2015. Additionally, in
response to customer complaints regarding network speed, ISA is undergoing a
review of the network architecture and infrastructure to determine how best to
improve network performance as soon as possible. A presentation will be provided
to the Board at the March meeting.
o Enterprise WiFi Assessment: ISA has engaged a partner to assess the CityCounty Building to add both public and private wireless access throughout the
building. The result will be recommendations for architecting the solution and
hardware requirements.
o Lync Rollout: The Microsoft instant messaging application is being rolled out as
the next step in the City-County Office365 implementation. ISA is working through
policies required to implement the client application on each City-County device and
configuring the cloud environment appropriately for the rollout.
o Secondary Site Relocation (Post Rd to Eastgate): The City-County secondary
site serves as the backup circuit in case of an internet outage in the City-County
Building as well as a backup firewall, web filtering appliance, active directory
domain and phone system failover. The current location at Post Road is ill-equipped
to meet the needs of modern infrastructure, so ISA is moving equipment to cage
space at the Lifeline data center at Eastgate in order to take advantage of
connectivity and rack space already available at that location. The move also
includes an upgrade to the circuit, allowing faster connectivity should the CityCounty circuit experience down time.



Firewall Replacement: A firewall is the first line of defense from outside attacks for
the City-County data center, and the City-County’s firewall is end of life. As planned
in the 2015 capital plan, ISA is reviewing options to upgrade the firewall for better
network security, performance and ease of management. This is being replaced in
tandem with the web filtering appliance.
Web Filtering Replacement: A web filtering appliance restricts access to
dangerous and prohibited content on the internet, and the City-County’s web
filtering appliance is end of life. As planned in the 2015 capital plan, ISA is reviewing
options to upgrade the web filtering appliance for better network security,
performance and ease of management. This is being replaced in tandem with the
firewall.
Office365 Productivity Suite Rollout: The final phase of the Office365 rollout
includes upgrading all City-County devices to utilize Office365 Productivity Suite.
This will give all City-County employees access to constantly updated versions of
Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. This also allows the City-County to
always remain in compliance with Microsoft licensing requirements going forward.
Windows 7 Enterprise Upgrade: The final City-County devices remaining on
Windows XP will be upgraded to Windows 7. These are machines that were not yet
refreshed or are utilizing old applications unable to be upgraded to Windows 7.
Network Load Balancer Replacement: A network load balancer aids in managing
network traffic to enable efficient use of bandwidth, and the City-County’s load
balancer is end of life. As planned in the 2015 capital plan, ISA is reviewing options
to upgrade the network load balancer for better network security, performance and
ease of management.

Infrastructure Performance Metrics:
o For January 2015, Atos met 47 of their established SLAs and missed 4. Three of
the four missed SLAs are displayed in the Board Report. Atos experienced a 34%
increase in ticket volume for the month of January. The other is as follows:

We received the highest number of returned surveys in January than in any month
prior. We experienced a 6.5% return rate for January. We have a number of
changes on customer satisfaction surveys coming out in the next few months. We
will be sending out communications to the enterprise to announce those changes.

Financial Management:
o ISA has spent 2% of our total expense budget as of the end of January. You will
notice a higher expense in the CIO and Finance Offices in January, that is due
to……..
o Application Management is one of the largest revenue areas for ISA. This service
category includes not only the cost for application development and support but also
the infrastructure that supports the applications.

Action Items:
Resolution 15-03- to Approve the Agreement Between the Department of Public
Works and GRW Engineers, Inc.
Seeking Approval of the Information Technology Board to authorize DPW to contract with
GRW Engineers to calculate data for a new GIS layer in an amount not to exceed Five

 Enterprise Device Selection: ISA initiated this project to select new
enterprise desktop and laptop standards for our PC Refresh program. The
Selection Committee, made up of customers representatives and ISA staff,
have made all final selections. We are currently in the BAFO and Contract
Execution Stage. We will announce to the enterprise the newly selection
standards as soon as the contract has been executed. My thanks to Ken
Clark, Rusty Robinson, Jeff Crawford, Al Stovall, Randy Williams, Manny
Mendez, Andy Dunkman, Scott Hohl and Major Hank Bosworth.
o Yellow Status:
 Windows 7 & Office 2010 Migration: While we have completed the Office
2010 migration, there are still some desktops/laptops in the environment that

o



have not yet been migrated to Windows 7. Some of these devices cannot
be migrated due to production applications that will not work in Windows 7.
We are working with those agencies/departments to either remediate or
replace those applications. There is also a small group of devices that are
due for PC Refresh in 2015 that have not yet been migrated to Windows 7.
We are working on either upgrading the device to Windows 7 or have the
device refreshed in each of these instances. It is our goal to have this last
portion of this major project completed by the end of June, 2015.
Added Projects:
 Hansen to Infor Public Sector Upgrade: ISA is working with DPW to
upgrade their current Hansen 7 application to the newest version which is
not called Infor Public Sector. This upgrade provides for several
enhancements such as: web-enablement, ad-hoc reporting tool, improved
integration with other applications and improved usability for its users.

Additional Updates:
o Outlook 365: I am pleased to announce that migrations to our new email platform,
Outlook 365, are almost complete. We have completed the migrations for all
City/County agencies/departments with the exception of the Marion County
Sherriff’s Department, at their request. This was a very large and difficult project to
move all of our email from the Exchange 2003 and Enterprise Vault environments to
Outlook 365.

Data Ownership Policy
Purpose
Data governance and ownership is essential for maintaining data privacy, security, and integrity.
In the City/County enterprise, data ownership will reside with the agency or department in which
it originated, unless otherwise noted. Each agency and department should establish their own
data ownership policy to detail the use, maintenance and protection of all data resources.
With the exception of network operations and data backup, Information Services Agency (ISA)
personnel and infrastructure vendors should not be the designated owners of any agency or
department’s data. ISA, in the role of data custodian, will never provide an agency or
department’s data in response to an internal or public records request without the agency or
department’s approval, unless required by law. Additionally, as custodian of data, ISA will make
data available for restore per the Backup Policy.

Scope
The scope of this policy covers all data that currently resides in a City/County-owned
workstation application, database, storage device or server.

Policy
Data Ownership
All data resources should have a designated owner responsible for data governance over its
effective use and protection. In the City/County enterprise, the default data owner, unless
otherwise specified, is the agency or department head. Information owners must establish
specific policies identifying the roles, business functions, processes, systems and applications
that may have access to each data resource.
Under no circumstance is ISA considered the owner of any data that originated in a different
agency or department. ISA understands their role as custodian of the information. Access, use,
or release of agency or department data, by ISA, shall only occur with the relevant agency or
department’s approval, or as required by law.

Data Classification and Control
Data classification is the process of organizing data into categories for effective and efficient
use, promoting data stewardship. Data owners, along with employees who regularly interact
with the data, should assess and classify the business critical nature of the data, severity and
likelihood of risks, and costs associated with restoring data in the event of a disaster.
All users of the data are responsible for handling it according to its assigned category. It is the
responsibility of data owners to ensure any City/County employee using their data resource(s)
are made aware of, and held accountable for, its protection and preservation.

3

Public Disclosure of Data
The City/County falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Indiana Access to Public Records Act
(APRA) IC 5-14-3. Information may only be released to the general public, regardless of its
categorization, through established procedures approved and authorized by the agency or
department owning the information or the Office of Corporation Counsel.
The ISA Chief Information Officer (CIO), or a designee, shall coordinate with the Corporation
Counsel, or a designee, before responding to any public records request. The Corporation
Counsel, or a designee, will confirm authorization and engage the ISA CIO to properly respond
to the request.
Employees, consultants or contractors placing data on the City/County network should
recognize that data is now owned by the agency or department for which they are doing
business. The data is subject to any regulations under APRA.
Unauthorized access or disclosure of data by ISA or the infrastructure vendor will result in
prompt disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment, criminal
prosecution where the act constitutes a violation of law, and an action for breach of contract
where applicable.

Internal Requests for Access to Data
There are instances when a supervisor or designee will request access to his or her employee’s
computer, email or H: drive data. This information can only be released to the supervisor with
the written permission by an authorized approver in the corresponding agency or department
(see Authorized Approver Policy). Coverage includes access to emails, databases, files and
other information hosted or maintained by ISA. Engaged ISA staff shall keep the matter strictly
confidential, so the identities of individuals are protected.

Personal and Confidential Information Protection
Personal Information, as defined in IC 4-1-11-3
Sec. 3.
(a) As used in this chapter, "personal information" means:
(1) an individual's:
(A) first name and last name; or
(B) first initial and last name; and
(2) at least one (1) of the following data elements:
(A) Social Security number.
(B) Driver's license number or identification card number.
(C) Account number, credit card number, debit card number, security code,
access code, or password of an individual’s financial account.
(b) The term does not include the following:
(1) The last four (4) digits of an individual's Social Security number.
(2) Publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the public from
records of a federal agency or local agency.

4

Collection and Protection of Personal Information
Personal information, as defined by IC 4-1-11-3, should not be disclosed unless required by law.
Personal information will be redacted from all public records requests.
Personal and confidential information shall be collected only where required by law and only
used for purposes of the original intent. Information systems containing personal and
confidential information shall be closely restricted in their access. Agencies and departments
with systems containing personal and confidential information shall establish rules for managing
and protecting it. Information systems shall incorporate protective measures that appropriately
manage access, restrict its transport, discourage leakage, and ensure suitable and confidential
destruction.
In the event personal and confidential information is compromised, all applicable laws shall be
followed. Law enforcement shall be engaged as appropriate.

Exceptions
ISA Management has the authority to allow exceptions in rare and compelling cases.
City/County agencies and departments should seek exceptions through their ISA Business
Services Consultant.

Disclaimer
This policy is subject to change without notice. A current and complete list of ISA policies are
maintained on the ISA Intranet site at
http://gateway.indy.gov/sites/ISA/AboutISA/policies_procedures/Pages/default.aspx

Policy Approval
Per Indianapolis Marion County Municipal Code Sec. 281-212.11, the City of
Indianapolis/Marion County IT Board has the power and authority to promulgate rules and
regulations for the efficient administration of its policies and procedures for users.
This policy has been reviewed and approved by the IT Board, and will be enforced as of the
effective date by the Chief Information Officer. It is the responsibility of all City/County IT
users to be in compliance with this policy at all times.
