**** COMMITTEE REPORT ****
None
**** DEPARTMENT HEADS ****
Mr. Jean ‚Äì Nothing to report
Chief Cole ‚ÄìHe gave a handout for the council with stats for August.
The police have begun using their own fuel system instead of purchasing gas
retail. There should be 50 cents a gallon in savings.
Officer Askren has been participating in drug interdiction training.
Oct 28 is the live date for the new reporting software, InterAct.
The mobile computers, which were funded by the Foundation, are about to be
installed in the police vehicles.
Chief Cole endorses a study be done to determine if a ‚ÄúChildren at Play‚Äù
sign should be used at Cedar Street and if adding a stop sign at 41 &amp;
Sycamore St. is advisable. Mayor Shepherd spoke to ACSC Superintendent Marshall
and he said backups in traffic may be a problem. Mr.
Marshall is against it. A crash has never occurred there, but there seems to be
close calls. Mayor Shepherd suggested this be evaluated further.
Mr. Grant asked Chief Cole if there were any new ordinance violations. Chief
Cole said there were no new ones.
Chief O‚ÄôFarrell ‚ÄìNot present
.Mr. Dismore ‚ÄìNothing to report.
**** UNFINISHED BUSINESS ****
Dalton Excavating will begin the demolition of 2 properties on Summit St. (604
&amp; 606)
Mr. Craft inquired about 207 N. Perry St. Mayor Shepherd said there are
outstanding bids/proposals but no plans to demolish yet.
**** NEW BUSINESS ****
Mayor Shepherd reported there are big repair costs associated with the 2
smaller pools. An estimate to repair one of the problems is $150,000. By next
month we‚Äôll bring some figures to the meeting to evaluate costs associated
with operating the pool in 2014.
**** MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS ****
Mr. Askren asked if there is anything new on the hotel repairs. Mayor Shepherd
said there is nothing new.
Mayor Shepherd wanted to bring the issue of brick falling off the 5th and Yount
St duplex to the council‚Äôs attention.
The parking lot for the city building will be top dressed and lined this
weekend. It will be taped off so no one will use it.
Mayor Shepherd is going to look at the Colonial Brick Company in Cayuga. He
will bring back paving brick quotes to the council.
Mr. Wilson asked about the broken urinal in the men‚Äôs restroom. Ron Jean said
the drain line is shot and it is contained in the concrete wall and floor.
Mayor Shepherd mentioned that if we make any changes to the bathrooms, we will
have to incorporate handicap accessible standards to our design. We have asked
a firm to quote several scenarios on how to update the city building.
Mr. Grant asked for an update on the riverfront grant. Mayor Shepherd said the
grant is for $177,000. The initial bids we put out came in at $352,000. We have
begun looking at using our city workers as sub-contractors to pour the
sidewalks and the pads to save money. We have 1 year and 8 months left to
complete the work.
Mr. Askren asked about the status of the Sycamore St project. Mayor Shepherd
said it will ‚Äúlet ‚Äú in 2016 (this is when the construction will take
place). By late 2016 to early 2017 the project should be done. INDOT required
an artifact dig in the area where a settling reservoir will be located. 3‚Äô
wide and 17‚Äô long trenches were dug and they sifted dirt through screens but
found nothing in the area.
Safe Routes to School is still in the works. Construction will not begin until
2015. A‚Äú106 Study‚Äù by the Historic Preservation &amp; Archaeology division
had to be performed because this area is adjacent to a Historic District.
The speed limit sign was reported not working, Huston Electric has looked at it
and says the battery is possibly bad. A school zone crossing sign is being
ordered.
Mr. Wilson noticed one sign coming down 28 into Attica says 25mph, the other
very soon after says 20mph. Should two contradictory signs be placed so close
to one another?
**** ADJOURNMENT ****
With no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned.

MINUTES APPROVAL: Connie made a motion to approve the minutes of our
previous meeting; Chris seconded the motion. All were in favor and the minutes were
approved.
CHARLIE FINECY MUSEUM UPDATE: Charlie says things are slow at the museum
this time of year. He also reported that one of the tree carvings, The Three Ages of
Lincoln, has some deterioration along the base of it. He spoke with Willy Loper about
solutions on how to preserve the carving. He suggested that we cut it off at the base and
fill it with an epoxy, or plastic wood, and place it on a stone base. This should preserve it
for many years.
CSO UPDATE/JOHN WETZEL: John Wetzel and Mark Sullivan, from Midwestern
Engineers, appeared before the council to discuss Phase III and IV of the CSO project.
John discussed the use of a 290,000 gallon storage container that would be used for our
overflow in the event of a heavy rain. We could then pump the overflow to the south
plant as time allowed. This would be part of our Phase IV project. It was also discussed
that the south plant is in need of some major improvements. These improvements to the
south plant were included in Midwestern‚Äôs projected cost for Phase IV. After some
discussion, it was decided to omit the cost of the improvements to the south plant in our
submission to IDEM. Ferman made a motion to submit to IDEM Phase III and up to the
storage containment for Phase IV for our long term control plan; Bob seconded the
motion. All were in favor and the motion passed. Ferman made a motion to allow
Umbaugh to do an overall study of our sewer utility, including suggestions for financing
of approximately 6.7 million dollars for our CSO project and upgrades to our south
treatment plant along with a review of our existing SRF bonds; Connie seconded the
motion. All were in favor and the motion was approved.
DOWNSPOUT ORDINANCE: Mayor Goffinet wanted to inform the council that we
are in the planning stages of preparing an ordinance that will allow us to enforce the
disconnection of all downspouts from our city sewer. City attorney, John Hargis, is
gathering information for this.
GENTRY BUILDING WALL: Mayor Goffinet stated that he had a bid of $15,800
from Klenck to deconstruct a portion of the west wall of the Gentry building. He was
going to submit it to the council tonight for approval, however, the wall fell this
afternoon. Building Inspector, Phil Brown, presented pictures of the Gentry building
from 2011 that showed the building needed a lot of repairs then. Connie made a motion

to allow the city to clean up the debris from the parking lot area; Carol seconded the
motion. All were in favor and the motion was approved.
AUTO PARTS BUILDING WALL: Phil Brown and Terry Davis discussed the
condition of the east wall of the Auto Parts building. They stated that the east wall is in
need of immediate attention. Chris made a motion to allow Terry Davis to get bids from
three contractors regarding the demolition of the east section of the Auto Parts building;
Connie seconded the motion. All were in favor and the motion was approved. Ferman
made a motion to allow the mayor the authority to make any immediate decisions
regarding the demolition/shoring of the wall; Chris seconded the motion. All were in
favor and the motion was approved.
OLD BUSINESS: Clerk-Treasurer, Susie Roberts, mentioned that she had spoken to
the State Board of Accounts regarding some shortfalls for the park. She learned that the
easiest solution would be to pay some of the pool repairs from a non-taxable account.
Carol made a motion to allow her to pay $20,349.82 in pool repairs from the AEP
account (Fund #473); Bob seconded the motion. All were in favor and the motion was
approved.
She also mentioned that she would like to start taking credit card payments by using
PayGov.us for utility payments. There would be no cost to the city for this service; all
fees are paid by the user. Chris made a motion to allow the utility department to start
using PayGov.us for utility payments; Carol seconded the motion. All were in favor and
the motion was approved.
Currently we are transferring $11,300 per month for the water bond payment and $14,000
per month for the sewer bond payment from the operating account to the bond payment
account. The Clerk-Treasurer has not been able to find any documentation regarding this
practice. At this time our bond payments are approximately $240,000 per year each for
water and sewer. She is recommending that we transfer $20,000 per month for each
utility to make the appropriate bond payments. Connie made a motion to allow the
Clerk-Treasurer to make monthly transfers of $20,000 from the operating account to the
bond payment account for each utility (water and sewer); Carol seconded the motion. All
were in favor and the motion was approved.
NEW BUSINESS: Susie brought it to the attention of the council that we have a
$255,373.58 sewer Certificate of Deposit maturing on December 22, 2013. Chris made a
motion to cash in the Certificate of Deposit and deposit it into the sewer extension and

The Common Council for the City of Attica met on July 11th, 2016, at 5:00 P.M.
pursuant to public notice.
Those present were: Board members; Mr. Askren, Mr. Craft, Mrs. Maus, Mr. Wilson
and Mr. Hall. Also present were: Mayor Roderick; City Attorney, Tom
O&#8217;Connor; and Clerk-Treasurer, Susan Stoll.
**** APPROVAL OF MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING ****
Mrs. Maus made a motion to approve the minutes from the June 13, 2016 meeting.
Mr. Hall seconded. All were in favor and the motion passed.
**** CITIZENS PETITIONS ****
Annie Peterson, who resides on David Dr., requested permission to place a
Geocache at McDonald Park, to partially bring attention to the time capsule.
She passed out a handout about Geocaching. A ‚Äútreasure‚Äù of little dollar
value will be placed at the location. GPS gives coordinates for ‚Äúthe find‚Äù.
Go to Geocaching.com for rules on what you can hide, there are already 3 caches
elsewhere in Attica. The Council said it would be a good idea to talk to the
Park Board. Mr. Askren and/or Mrs. Maus said they would go to a Park Board
Meeting to discuss the topic with them.
Daniel Askren gave congratulations to the Sesquicentennial Committee on a job
well done. He next addressed the Council, stating that the Council had
previously stated that the Attica Police Department would not patrol outside a
2 mile radius of city limits.¬ ¬  He stated that the APD was seen patrolling
outside that limit on June 29. He then addressed his concerns about Chief Cole
writing a grant to fund an additional officer. The City already employs 6 full-
time officers and 1 full-time School Resource Officer. He cited some statistics
about the number of Criminal Misdemeanors, Ordinance Violations and Infractions
that have been issued by the APD. He did not feel the amount of tickets that
have run through our city court merit the addition of more police officers. We
currently have 7 officers for the city and there are 7 officers for the county.
Carolyn Carlson spoke on behalf of the Sesquicentennial Committee. She gave a
thank you to the City of Attica, and stated the department heads were very
helpful with the event. She said that Daniel Askren is the chairman for the
next Sesquicentennial.
Nancy Cormier with the American Legion also said thank you for a job well done
on the Sesquicentennial.
A letter and check for $150.00 was received from Wallace Hooker to cover costs
of an officer‚Äôs assistance at the 341/28 intersection for a funeral
procession that was traveling from Wingate to Riverside Cemetery. Mayor
Roderick read the letter in Mr. Hooker‚Äôs absence. Mr. Hooker was very
thankful for Office Kemp coordinating and Office Ed Durnil from APD assisting.
Mayor Roderick asked if we have a policy in place regarding this type of
situation. It was agreed that if police are called by dispatch, they should be
able to go, even if it is out of city limits.
Ed Durnil, stating that he was speaking as a taxpayer, would ignore the 2 mile
radius rule if his assistance was needed by a fellow officer.
**** COMMITTEE REPORTS ****
The Planning Committee recommends the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan to the
City Council members.
**** DEPARTMENT HEADS ****
Streets Superintendent, Mr. Jean:not present.
Police Department, Chief Cole:present; he reported there have been 2506 runs
year to date, this is the same pace as last year. He passed out statistics to
the Council. Chief Cole reported the total cost to equip cars with modems, so
the City would be able to track police vehicle travel, is $6,059.95 for
equipment and installation. He also reported that there are 10 bullet-proof
vests that will expire August 31stof this year. There is $3,982.00 in
reimbursement money available to the City if claimed by the August 31st
deadline. The cost of new vests is $750-900 per vest, 2X/3X will run $25-50
more. Mrs. Maus made a motion to purchase 8 vests. The motion was seconded by
Mr. Hall, all were in favor and the motion passed.

in June, 125 runs for the year (25 less than same period last year).

renovation and 301 Bond St., storage building.
**** UNFINISHED BUSINESS ****
The Off-Road Vehicle Ordinance was tabled at our last Council Meeting but has
not been published as of today. Tom O‚ÄôConnor advised the Council that they
may adopt but if they did, it would not be effective until 10 days after
publication, or table it again and then adopt in the August Council Meeting.
Mr. Hall made a motion to bring Ordinance # 6, 2016, An Ordinance Amending
Chapter 8, Article 9 By the Inclusion of Section 8-87, Entitled traffic
regulations for the use of off-road vehicles (ORV) within the City of Attica,
from the table and read for the 3rd time in full. Mrs. Maus seconded, Mr.
Wilson was a no vote, all others were a yes vote.
Mr. O‚ÄôConnor read for the third time in full. Mr. Hall made a motion to adopt
Ordinance # 6, 2016, Mrs. Maus, seconded, the motion was passed by a vote of 5-
0. ¬ Bunny Jordan suggested a bright orange sticker so it is easily visible by
the police. Mrs. Stoll will have the Ordinance published in the Fountain County
Neighbor and will order permit stickers for ORV‚Äôs as well.
Mayor Roderick asked if the Council would like to consider adding an alcohol
use policy for City Parks. Mayor Roderick proposed to allow use in the parks
for special occasions but to not be allowed otherwise. A proposed Ordinance
will be worked up by Tom O‚ÄôConnor.
The topic of time clocks/Biometrics will be brought up at a future meeting.
Mrs. Stoll will investigate further and come back to the Council with more
information.
The time of our Common Council meetings was previously discussed, it has been
suggested that the time of the meeting to change from 5 PM to 6 PM. Mr. Hall
made a motion to read Ordinance # 9, 2016, Ordinance of the Common Council for
the City of Attica, Indiana, An Ordinance Amending Chapter 3, Article 1,
Division 1, Section 3-4, Entitled Regular Meetings of the Common Council, for
the 1st time in-full, and for a second time by title only. Mr. Askren seconded
the motion. The Ordinance was read. Mr. Hall made a motion to suspend the rules
and read for the 3rd time in full and to adopt. Mr. Askren seconded. All were
in favor and the motion passed. Mr. O‚ÄôConnor stated that because the
Ordinance does not carry any penalty, this process can be followed for
adoption.
**** NEW BUSINESS ****
Mr. O‚ÄôConnor spoke about dilapidated buildings. The Board of Works has asked
how the City can enforce the compliance of an order by the Building
Commissioner. They asked if the City can add an additional remedy in the form
of a extra daily fine for those who do not take action on the Building
Commissioner. Mr. O‚ÄôConnor drew up Ordinance # 10, 2016, An Ordinance
Amending Chapter 6, Article 12, Entitled Unsafe Building Conditions By the
Inclusion of Section 6-188 for the Council‚Äôs consideration.
Mr. Hall made a motion to read Ordinance # 10, 2016 for the first time in full,
a second time in title only, then table and publish. Mrs. Maus seconded, all
were in the favor and the motion passed. Mr. O‚ÄôConnor proceeded to read the
Ordinance in full for the first time and in title only for the second time.
**** MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS ****
Mayor Roderick stated there are DVD‚Äôs of the movie shown at the Devon during
the Sesquicentennial for sale at the city building for $10.00.
Larry Askren asked if it is true that an 8th officer is being considered. If
so, he suggests that there be a hiring freeze. He stated that the City pays the
salary and benefits of the School Resource Officer during the summer time. He
suggested that the School Resource Officer be filled by an existing officer on
the force and to take money out of the budget for the 7th officer. That would
drop our regular force down to 5 officers plus we would still continue to pay
the Resource Officer‚Äôs pay during the summer.
The President of the Council was never officially voted on for 2016 so Mr.
Askren nominated Josh Hall, Mr. Wilson seconded. Mr. Roderick asked if there
were any other nominations. None were presented. Mayor Roderick asked if the
all of the Council were in favor of this nomination and they were so the motion
passed.
Ed Durnil spoke about the suggested reduction in the police force and expressed
his opposition to it due to the consequence of scheduling issues that will come
from one less officer.
**** ADJOURNMENT ****
Mr. Wilson motioned to adjourn the meeting and Mr. Craft seconded, all were in
favor.
The next meeting will be August 8th, 2016 at 6:00 PM.
