Introduction
The size of the prison population in Indiana and the volume of people leaving prison and
returning to Marion County (Indianapolis) is a public policy crisis. Consider the following:
ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑

Over the past 20 years, the number of people in prison in this state has reached an alltime high. In 1989, the prison population in this state had risen to a level higher than had
been the case at any point in the state‚Äôs history. On the final day of that year, there were
12,341 adults incarcerated in Indiana prisons. Ten years later (on the final day of the year
in 1999), the population in Indiana prisons had risen to 19,309. Another ten years passed
and by the end of 2009, the prison population was now 28,389.
Over the same 20-year period, the crime rates were following an entirely different
pattern, as evidenced in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Indiana Crime Rates (Per 10,000 Residents)

In fact, the crime rates for Indiana in 2010 were lower than they had been at any point
since 1969. Research has consistently shown that the reductions in crime rates over this
period are not due to the increases in the rates of incarceration.

According to a report issued by the Justice Policy Institute in 2009, Indiana spent $645
Million on correctional expenditures in 2007.1 It is particularly noteworthy that only 17
states spent more on correctional costs that same year.

Scope of the Research Question
The purpose of the analysis reported here is to estimate the financial savings that would be
realized with a one-percent decrease in the recidivism rate for Marion County. There are
multiple dimensions to this particular research question. First, there must be a determination as
to what is meant by the term ‚Äúrecidivism.‚Äù We begin with a cohort of offenders that have been
released from prison and returned to communities within Marion County. Recidivism for this
group may involve any new arrests committed after their release from prison. An important
consideration is how to identify indicators of new criminal offenses. As we are relying on
official measures of offending, we would either be interested in capturing new arrests or new
convictions. An alternate approach would be to examine whether the offenders returned to
prison within a specified period of time. A return to prison would either be the result of a
conviction on a new offense or the result of violating the terms of their conditional release (i.e.,
the terms of their parole or probation). For the state of Indiana, the Indiana Department of
Correction (IDOC) has a tradition of considering recidivism as any return to prison within three
years of release from an IDOC facility.
Another dimension to the key research question for this project has to do with the matter of
estimating the costs associated with recidivism. There are a variety of ways that the costs
associated with crimes have been conceptualized. In addition to the ways that costs accrue due
to the different aspects of criminal justice processing (costs associated with police actions,
incarcerations in jail, court processing costs, community supervision costs related to probation
and community corrections, and prison commitments), there is also research that has calculated
social costs relating to the property loss and victim costs.2 In a report from the Criminal Justice
Commission for the State of Oregon, Michael Wilson provided taxpayer and victimization costs
for a series of processing points in the criminal justice system, including arrest, conviction,
probation, parole, and jail. Wilson notes that the taxpayer costs for each point in the criminal
justice system are not easy to estimate. His estimates are presented for a limited number of
offenses: homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and then the broad categories of property
crimes, drug offenses, and other offenses.

For the purposes of this analysis, we examined the possibility of providing a more detailed
analysis that considered the criminal justice costs and social costs described above. To do so
would, unfortunately, require the manual capturing of detailed information from the county‚Äôs
data management system JUSTIS. For a recent analysis on recidivism for Marion County‚Äôs LAP
initiative, we were provided with data on arrests from the JUSTIS system. Those data, however,
did not specify the reason for the arrest so we are unable to identify the offense or to distinguish
arrests for new offenses from those arrests for probation and parole violations. We have access
to JUSTIS to look up the information, but the amount of time that would be necessary to gather
these data for the full release cohort would have meant this project could not be completed
within the 30-day window we agreed to.3
We should note as well that there were concerns with the data that was made available to us
for this analysis. From Marion County, we received a data set that was supposed to capture all
arrests for the observation period of interest. We have come to understand, though, that the data
are not complete and the gaps in the data are not systematic or predictable. Coupled with the
situation described above where we are limited in our ability to distinguish the new arrests from
technical violations, we could not have produced an analysis that we could have offered with
confidence as the basis for valid conclusions. We also received data from IDOC on those
offenders released to Marion County. We were under the impression that we were provided with
a complete cohort of released offenders. Yet, for the cohort we focus on in this analysis (those
released from prison in 2007), we received data from IDOC on 4,776 offenders released from
prison and returning to Marion County.
The data provided by IDOC is incomplete, though, in ways we can determine and correct for.
To be able to estimate the costs associated with returning the offenders to prison, we needed to
know how long they were expected to be in prison. From the data we received from IDOC, we
needed to look up expected release dates on 706 offenders. In 22% of the cases, we learned that
the offender had already been released from prison, and as such, should have appeared in
subsequent release cohorts but did not. This gap in the data was unexpected, but we were able to
manually fill in gaps and have done so. Relative to the gaps that appear in the JUSTIS data, we
believe we are able to produce cost estimates with more confidence based on the data we have on
prison returns and releases.
Given the concerns we note here, we elected to go with the following research design.

We drew a random sample of cases from the release cohort and compiled comprehensive follow-up data on
arrests, convictions and jail stays. In a separate report, we will offer a proposal for a more detailed costs analysis
based on such a comprehensive examination of the data. Such an analysis would require a longer time to
complete.

We are interested in estimating the cost savings associated with a one-percent reduction in
recidivism. We define recidivism as the return of an offender to prison within three years after
his or her release from prison. Since we were interested in a follow-up period of three full years
after release, we elected to base our analysis on a cohort of offenders released from IDOC during
2007. We received data from IDOC that identified a cohort of 4,776 offenders released at some
point during 2007 and returning to Marion County. In the data set we received, we were also
provided with information on whether each offender returned to IDOC within three years after
their release. If they returned to prison, we looked to determine how long they were due to be in
prison. Our estimates of the costs of the reincarceration were calculated by multiplying the
expected (or actual if the person has already been released again) number of days in prison by
the current average per diem rate reported by IDOC: $53.96. To determine the expected length
of the prison stay, we did one of the following, as appropriate:
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑

If the person has already been released from prison again, we captured the actual release
date.
If the person is still in prison, we looked for what IDOC reports as the earliest possible
release date. This provides a conservative estimate of the length of time in prison, as
some of these offenders may not be actually released on the earliest possible date.
In a small number of cases, we did not have access to an earliest possible release date. In
those cases, we based our expected release date on the sentence from the court, taking
into account any good-time credit calculations that the offender is eligible for. In one
case, the offender is serving a life sentence, so we based the expected release date on
current estimates of expected life span given the individual‚Äôs demographic
characteristics.

Results of Analysis
Of the 4,776 offenders released from prison in 2007, 2,463 had been returned to prison
within three years of their release date. This represents 51.6% of the original sample. That more
than half of the formerly-incarcerated offenders are returned to prison is disappointing in and of
itself. It is also noteworthy, though, that IDOC has published three-year recidivism rates for
those released from 2002-2005 and found statewide return rates of 39.2% for those released in
2002, 38.6% for those released in 2003, 37.8% for those released in 2004, and 37.4% for those
released in 2005. A three-year recidivism rate of 51.6% suggests that the recidivism rates in
Marion County are higher than in other parts of the state. Our analysis shows that among all the
offenders returning to prison within three years of their release, the average length of time each
offender will spend in prison is 626 days and the average cost for the new period of incarceration
per offender is $33,786.

When an offender returns to prison, IDOC identifies whether the person is coming to prison
because of a new offense or because of a technical violation. We make use of that designation in
distinguishing between several groups of returning offenders:
ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑

Those who have been convicted of a new offense and sentenced to prison on a new
cause number. 1,090 offenders (22.8%) fell in this category. The average length of
time an offender in this group will spend in prison when they go back is 686 days.
The average cost per offender of the new incarceration is $36,998.
Those who were returned to prison as a result of a revocation of their community
supervision (probation, CTP, or parole). There were 1,373 (28.7%) persons in this
category. It is noteworthy that among those returning to prison, more than half were
returned for violations. The average length of time an offender in this group will
spend in prison when they go back is 579 days. The average cost per offender of the
new incarceration is $31,236.
o Among those returning to prison for violating the terms of their community
supervision, 1,016 (21.3% of the total cohort) were returned for a technical
rule violation. This group tended to spend shorter amounts of time in prison
when they did go back. The average length of time an offender in this group
will spend in prison when they go back is 409 days. The average cost per
offender of the new incarceration is $22,055.
o Among those returning to prison for violating the terms of their community
supervision, 357 (7.5% of the total cohort) were returned on the basis of a new
offense (although not necessarily convicted of a new offense). This group
tended to spend the longest average amounts of time in prison when they did
go back. The average length of time an offender in this group will spend in
prison when they go back is 1,063 days. The average cost per offender of the
new incarceration is $57,363.

We are looking to conceptualize the cost savings of a 1% reduction in recidivism for each of the
groups identified above. We consider a 1% reduction based on the actual rate of recidivism as
described above. So for instance, the data show that among all offenders in the cohort, 51.6%
recidivate. For this analysis, we consider the impact of moving the recidivism rate from 51.6%
to 50.6%. In Table 1, we calculate the number of cases involved in a 1% reduction in recidivism.
With such a reduction, we then present the revised recidivism rate and the new number of cases
in that particular group. Then we calculate the total costs for the original number of offenders in
that group returning to prison. We also calculate the costs for the reduced number of offenders
in that group (after moving the percentage down by 1%). From these two values, we calculate
the difference to determine how much we can save by reducing recidivism by one percent.
Figure 2 and Figure 3 provide summary results on the costs for the five groups. We then repeat
this same analysis where the outcome of interest is the number of bed-days associated with each
group going back to prison. Table 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 provide those results.

Discussion
The results of this analysis point to a number of policy-relevant conclusions. First, the
recidivism rate for Marion County is high relative to statewide estimates. The costs associated
with the high recidivism rate are also substantial. The cost of returning so many offenders to
prison is more than $83 Million. To reduce the recidivism rate by one percent would involve
keeping a ‚Äúmere‚Äù 46 offenders from returning to prison. What could we do to ensure that 46
offenders are retained in the community? This might involve providing treatment-focused
supervision that has been shown to effectively reduce recidivism in other jurisdictions. Let‚Äôs
speculate that we could hire two treatment-focused parole/probation officers to manage these 46
offenders. If they are effective at keeping the offenders from returning to prison, we stand to
save $1.55 Million. Hiring two such officers could be done for much less than $1.55 Million. In
addition, for every additional 46 offenders retained in the community we stand to save an
additional $1.55 Million.
Our estimate of the cost savings is based on the number of days that offenders would
otherwise be in prison and assumes that if we keep one person from going to prison that we
actually would realize a true savings in the costs of incarcerating that person. Yet, we know that
until we have a significant reduction in the number of people going to prison, perhaps so that we
can in fact close one of our prisons, we are not really saving the amount of money that is
identified by the state as the per diem costs associated with one offender. Another way to
consider the impact of a reduction in the percentage of offenders returning to prison is to
examine the number of bed-days that are saved when the offenders are not going back to prison.
So, for example, we can also say that since the typical offender returned to prison will spend 626
days incarcerated, by reducing the recidivism rate by 1% for Marion County, we are saving the
state 28,802 prison bed-days.
The results of this analysis also point to the differential impact that we might realize if we
focus more on retaining people in the community once they have violated the terms of their
supervision. Again, this is where we might look to other parts of the U.S. for examples of
effective strategies that have resulted in fewer people returning to prison. When we are able to
reduce the number of returning prisoners so much that we can actually realize savings in terms of
needing fewer facilities or fewer staff, then we can begin to consider ways to reinvest the savings
to expand the capacity of the community to support the offenders in their efforts to stay out of
prison. We might also think about this from an investment perspective. Community-based
efforts that actually lead to the reduction in the number of people returning to prison might be
expected, over time, to realize cost savings of the magnitude determined here.

The literature provides many directions for policy changes that support the goals of reducing
the number of people in prison without increases in the risks to public safety. Some of these
potential changes include:4

Parole should be transformed to emphasize the provision of services and support in
addition to performing their supervision function. The overall goal should be to see
fewer offenders returning to prison for violating the terms of their parole‚Äîeither
technical rule violations or by committing new crimes.
When states have ‚Äúshifted supervision modalities from intense supervision to support‚Äù,
the results have been that fewer people go back to prison on technical violations. The use
of risk assessments to determine the appropriate intensity of supervision is recommended.
There must be greater access to effective evidence-based treatment in the community.
Deliberate effort is needed to reduce the barriers to civic participation for those released
from prison: this means increasing access to jobs, education, welfare benefits, and
affordable housing, among other things.
Significantly reduce the use of parole supervision for nonviolent offenders
Introduce graduated sanctions for those violating the terms of their community
supervision
Reinvest savings from reducing reincarcerations for the improvement of criminogenic
social conditions

RE: Asbestos Building Inspection for 35 West Maryland Street, Evansville, Indiana ‚Äì CES
Project #116-1026.
Dear Mr. Beane:
On June 28, 2016 Caprice Mattingly of Crane Environmental Services, LLC conducted
an Asbestos Building Inspection to determine if there was any Asbestos Containing
Material (ACM) present at the subject property. The site is a vacant house with a
basement and finished attic which is scheduled to be demolished.
Great care was taken to account for all spaces within the building. Hidden spaces were
evaluated by physical or visual inspection as reasonably accessible. Hidden spaces
include inaccessible pipe chases, sub-walls behind exposed walls, layers of tile under
carpet or other tile, roofing materials under impenetrable surfaces, inaccessible sections
of the building, etc. All hidden layers accessible through minor alterations were observed
and tested if suspected for ACM‚Äôs. Some hidden areas were assumed to contain the
same materials as accessible areas that were observed.
Twelve bulk samples and one duplicate sample of suspect asbestos containing material
were collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Two of the samples were Asbestos
Containing Material (ACM) defined as any material which contains more than one percent
(1%) asbestos. The laboratory results are attached, and summarized as follows:

expected to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation operations. All
floor tile, sheet vinyl flooring, asphalt roofing products, and flashing present was
presumed to be Category I non-friable Asbestos Containing Material (ACM). The
quantities of RACM and Category I and Category II ACM are summarized in the table

Plan Commission Board
The Plan Commission Board handles all set back applications, rezoning
applications, and preliminary subdivision development for the City of Madison.
All applications for the Plan Commission Board may be paid with cash or check
made out to Madison City Plan Commission. 
Complete applications are due by 3:00 p.m. at least_ten_(10)_days_prior_to
filing_deadline.  This allocates time for staff to review the project and if
needed request additional information prior to the filing deadline.  Failure to
submit your application at least ten (10) days before the filling deadline may
result in your application not being on the next Madison City Plan Commission
agenda.  If the tenth day falls on a holiday or weekend, the deadline will be
the following business day. For a list of meeting dates and filing deadlines,

****** SOUTH BEND READY FOR FIRST SNOWFALL OF THE SEASON ******

The first snowfall of the season is on its way, and the City of South Bend is
doing all it can to prepare and keep residents safe.
Leaf collection crews are preparing to switch to snow plowing. On Friday, City
trucks will see leaf collection attachments removed, and snow plows added.
Crews will apply deicer to South Bend streets Friday night, and Street
Department employees are on standby to plow snow Saturday morning.
During snowfall, main arterial streets such as Michigan Street will be plowed
first. Once snowfall stops and the main streets are plowed, the city will move
on to smaller and residential streets, says Eric Horvath, director of public
works.
The goal is to clear main arterial streets of ice and snow as soon as possible.
Work on these streets begins at the start of a storm and continues until the
streets can be safely traversed.
Smaller and residential streets are addressed after major streets are
sufficiently clear for traffic to use with normal caution. The Street
Department strives to make at least one pass on every residential street within
36 hours after the snowfall has ended.
The City reminds residents of new procedures for snow removal approved by the
Common Council in January 2015. However the ordinance is not applied unless a
Residential Snow Removal Condition is declared by the Mayor or the Director of
Public Works.
When a Residential_Snow_Removal_Condition is declared, residents will be
notified via the City‚Äôs website, social media, and news outlets that they are
to park on the even side of a street (south or east) on even-numbered days and
on the odd side (north or west) on odd-numbered days.
All other parking restrictions will be lifted at such times. Residents who are
in violation of the parking restrictions when the new ordinance is in effect
may receive a $25 fine.
Property owners and residents are also urged to do their best to keep their
sidewalks shoveled.¬ It is the responsibility of the owner or occupant of any
premises on any city street to remove snow and ice from the public sidewalk
within 24 hours after snow or ice has fallen or accumulated.¬ If an owner or
occupant fails to comply, the City may remove snow and ice after giving the
owner or occupant 24 hours written notice, and the owner or occupant will be
responsible for the cost of removal.
Keeping our sidewalks clear of snow and ice is especially important for the
safety of children and elders.¬ Clear sidewalks also provide a safe working
environment for those who work in our neighborhoods, including utility
locators, postal workers, newspaper delivery people, and others who provide
services to and around our homes.
Neighbors are encouraged to look out for and help each other, as some may be
unable to move their snowed-in vehicles or clear their curbs and sidewalks
without assistance.¬ ¬ 
Residents with questions about non-emergency services are encouraged to call
311, South Bend‚Äôs resident service line, Monday through Friday between 7:30
am and 5:30 pm.

REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTER INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
The Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee of the City-County Council met on
Monday, December 2, 2013. Chair Joseph Simpson called the meeting to order at 5:34 p.m. with
the following members present: Aaron Freeman, Will Gooden, Monroe Gray, Pamela Hickman,
Benjamin Hunter, Angela Mansfield, Janice McHenry, Vop Osili, and Jack Sandlin.
Representing Council staff were General Counsel Fred Biesecker, Council Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) Hope Tribble and Fiscal and Policy Analyst Ryan Kramer.
Chair Simpson asked the Clerk to name the committee members who have submitted their
disclosure forms. The Clerk stated that Councillors Simpson, Gray, Mansfield, Hickman and
Osili have all submitted their forms.
Chair Simpson asked the committee members if they had questions or concerns regarding the
minutes from the November 4, 2013 meeting. Councillor Sandlin stated he needs clarification on
whether the committee is working under the presumption that the lease for the ROC had
unfavorable terms. Mr. Biesecker stated that under Section 3 of the resolution the general nature
of the investigation is described, stating that it is to, among other things, determine whether the
city has entered into other leases with similar unfavorable terms. He stated that it is known that
many are not pleased with the terms of the lease; however, it is not meant to suggest that there
has been any prejudgment. Councillor Hunter corrected an error in the November 4 minutes,
stating that he said that the Councillors are to submit the Campaign Finance Report as something
to refer back to, as it would be more comprehensive.
Chair Simpson asked Mr. Biesecker to provide the status of the document requests he has sent to
the Office of Corporation Counsel (OCC) and to Alex Carroll‚Äôs attorney. Mr. Biesecker stated
that he sent the document requests to Andy Seiwert from OCC and Mr. Carroll‚Äôs attorney, David
Brooks, on November 15, 2013. He stated that OCC was able to produce some of the requested
documents; however, Mr. Brooks stated that he wants to wait until the City has submitted all of
its documents to prevent duplication. Mr. Biesecker added that he trusts that the City will fully
respond to the requests.
Councillor Sandlin asked if the documents will be placed on the ROC website. Mr. Biesecker
affirmed.
Councillor Mansfield stated that she is concerned that Mr. Brooks is waiting for the City‚Äôs results
before he submits the requested documents. She stated that because both parties received the
request, then both parties should provide their documents in order to compare the information
that is given. Mr. Biesecker stated that he intends to state that in his response to Mr. Brooks.
Councillor Gooden asked if there are relevant statutes that govern the procedure and the
investigation committee. Mr. Biesecker that there is not much in relation to the ROC Committee
as such; however, there are statutes and Council rules that authorize investigating committees, as
well as the Council resolution and guidelines for the ROC Committee.

Members of the Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee

Chair Simpson moved the meeting along by asking Mr. Biesecker to discuss the State law and
Local Code as they pertain to the approval of leases. Mr. Biesecker read the relevant State
statutes and local ordinances that apply to the creation and approval of leases entered into by
public agencies, which is attached as Exhibit A. He stated that he does not have personal
knowledge of the internal procedures and policies that were in place in 2011; however, it is
expected that OCC administrators and the Office of Finance and Management (OFM) will
answer questions regarding the procedures and policies at the next meeting. He made the
following key points:
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢

The State code provides that the Council‚Äôs role is to determine whether a lease of a
structure is needed.
The State code requires a lessor to submit plans, specifications, and estimates to the
leasing agent before executing a lease.
After the lessor and the leasing agent have agreed on terms and conditions of the lease,
but before the execution of the lease, there must be a public hearing, with notice that is
published ten days beforehand, and the hearing must be held before the leasing agent.
If a lease is executed, there must be an appropriation at a rate sufficient to provide the
money to pay the rent.
The local code defines city and county contracts as those for the purchase of goods and
services, not leases.
The office of corporation counsel shall review each city contract and county contract
The City Controller shall examine and approve all city and county contracts
A City or County contract that is executed without approval of the office of corporation
counsel, the city controller, or the mayor shall be voidable on that basis alone.
The Office of Finance and Management has the power to examine all contracts, purchase
orders and other documents involving financial obligations and approve them only upon
ascertaining that there is a balance from which money may be drawn for payment.
The Director of Public Safety has the power to purchase, rent or improve upon any real
estate, subject to appropriation therefore by the City-County Council and subject to the
powers of the Mayor and the Board of Public Safety.
The Board of Public Safety has the power to approve the acquisition of and leases for real
estate by the Department of Public Safety.

Mr. Biesecker stated that it should be considered whether the code should be changed to include
leases for the purposes of the City and County contract signature requirements. He stated that the
signature page of the ROC lease does not include the signatures of OCC or OFM, as they were
not required, but the committee may want to consider a change.
Councillor Mansfield asked if state law regulates what the ‚Äúprincipal terms of the lease‚Äù are. Mr.
Biesecker stated that it is not a defined term under Indiana Code 36-1-10-2. She asked if there is
a city ordinance that excludes a lease from being considered as a good or service. Mr. Biesecker
stated that he did not believe there is; however, the interpretation was that a lease is not a
contract for good or services, which could possibly explain why there was no signature from
OCC or OFM. He stated that the language of the ordinance may not be broad enough to include
leases, but he cannot specifically answer why they did not sign the lease.

Members of the Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee

Councillor Sandlin asked if there is a requirement regarding leases as debt obligations, and
whether there are separate requirements for government regarding approvals when executing a
lease. Mr. Biesecker stated that IC 36-1-10 is the primary source of State law with respect to
leases and lease purchases. He stated that he is unaware of anything outside of that statute.
Councillor Hickman asked if IC 36-1-10-13(b) requires more detail regarding rental payment
other than what is stated in the statute. Mr. Biesecker stated that the statute does not specify
whether more information is required.
Councillor Osili asked what IC 5-3-1 requires in regards to the publication of notices. Mr.
Biesecker stated that when the Council or an administrative agency publishes a notice, it needs to
be published at least ten days in advance and must contain the items described in the statute.
Councillor Osili asked what is included in a summary. Mr. Biesecker stated that the statute states
that it must include the principal terms of the lease. Councillor Osili asked if there are more
relevant State statutes regarding leasing documents. Mr. Biesecker stated that he did not include
the entire State Code chapter; however, he included the statutes before the committee to point out
that once a lease is executed, the Council is mandated by State law to make an annual
appropriation that is sufficient to pay the rental.
Councillor Mansfield asked Mr. Biesecker if he could find out the type of representation the City
had when the lease was executed. Mr. Biesecker stated that it could be looked into and discussed
at the next meeting. Councillor Gray asked if it is possible that the former Director of Public
Safety, Frank Straub, represented the City during the time the lease was executed. Mr. Biesecker
stated that, at the time, Mr. Straub used John Mayes as an attorney, but is not sure why Mr.
Straub chose Mr. Mayes to represent him instead of using OCC.
Chair Simpson moved forward by stating that OFM and OCC will be present to advise the
Committee on the business practices, administrative procedures and processes, the steps which
are taken to approve a lease and information regarding the Space Allocation Committee. The
Controller and the OCC have been asked to provide in writing, their directives and business
practices regarding leases and the role the two agencies play in approving leases. By providing
this information beforehand, committee members will have a chance to review the information
before the next meeting, which will be held on January 8, 2014 at 5:30 p.m. in room 118 on the
first floor of the City-County Building. Both agencies have confirmed their presence at the
meeting, and will give a presentation and answer any questions committee members may have.
Chair Simpson called for public testimony.
CL Day, President of the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, stated that there were concerns
regarding the working conditions of the officers at the ROC, the plan to hire minority workers,
and that the electricity was shut off. He stated that the Concerned Clergy is pleased that the
committee is investigating the center.
Councillor Osili asked if a Code consultant had been hired to review the documents before they
were submitted to code review. Mr. Biesecker stated that he requested the documents related to

Members of the Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee

the design and construction of improvements, alleged noncompliance with Code requirements,
changes to the initial plans, progress reports, inspection reports, and documents evidencing any
planned reviews done prior to the beginning of construction improvements. Councillor Osili
asked if it could be determined whether a code review consultant was hired. Mr. Biesecker
affirmed.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Regional Operations Center
Investigating Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:32 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Joseph Simpson, Chair

PROPOSAL NO. 148, 2013. The proposal, sponsored by Councillors Adamson, Holliday, Lutz,
Hickman, Mansfield, Mascari, Moriarty Adams, Evans, Freeman, Pfisterer, Sandlin and Scales,
supports the decision of the Metropolitan Development Commission in Zoning Case No. 2011MOD-011 and urges the Indianapolis Airport Authority to terminate its present efforts to appeal
and overturn that zoning decision. Councillor Adamson said that the Airport and the Mayor‚Äôs
Office were opposed to this development and sought to overturn the ruling of the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) in this zoning issue to prevent the project. He said that the
judge ruled against them, and they also received a second denial by two individual bodies. They
further appealed Judge Keele‚Äôs decision to the Supreme Court, and if they could not win, they
continued to delay the process through appeals until the proponents ran out of money to continue
to fight or until the land owner gave up. He said that it is a shame that it took a bi-partisan
resolution to prompt a new moment of clarity, and is a travesty as to how much time and dollars
have been wasted on this issue. He said that he did receive confirmation that the airport has
dropped their appeal and will finally allow the developer to get to work. It would be nice if they
would repay the developer the money they spent in litigation, but this is a start. He moved,
seconded by Councillor Lutz, to postpone the proposal indefinitely. Proposal No. 148, 2013 was
postponed by a unanimous voice vote.
Councillor Robinson reported that the Metropolitan and Economic Development Committee
heard Proposal Nos. 59 and 81, 2013 on April 29, 2013. He asked for consent to vote on these
proposals together. Consent was given.
PROPOSAL NO. 59, 2013. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Lewis, reappoints Melissa
Coxey to the Metropolitan Board of Zoning Appeals, Division II. PROPOSAL NO. 81, 2013.
The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Lewis, appoints Vicki J. Wright as the large business,
Class I, representative to the Wellfield Education Corporation Board. By unanimous votes, the
Committee reported the proposals to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Gooden asked for consent to abstain, as Ms. Coxey is a former member of the law
firm for which he works. Consent was given.
Councillor Robinson moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, for adoption. Proposal Nos. 59 and
81, 2013 were adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

Councillor Mahern said that he cannot support the proposal, as it sets about to study ways to raise
people‚Äôs property taxes. He said that they would better be served by studying ways to improve
neighborhoods, but they do not need to study how to raise residential property taxes.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, for adoption. Proposal No.
121, 2013, as amended, was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

of the study commission is to analyze the issue and have an honest conversation about how to

Councillor Gray thanked Local 416 Firefighters Union past president Wayne Smith and his staff
for helping to secure this grant.
Councillor Mahern said that it is good to have more firefighters, but without enough police
officers to back them up, there will be more crime resulting in fires.

SPECIAL ORDERS - FINAL ADOPTION
PROPOSAL NO. 82, 2013. Councillor Robinson reported that the Metropolitan and Economic
Development Committee heard Proposal No. 82, 2013 on April 29, 2013. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillors Barth, Adamson, Cain, Moriarty Adams, McQuillen, Miller and Osili,
confirms the designation of certain real property as a high technology district area and that
qualified property owned by ExactTarget, Inc is exempt from property taxation. By an 8-0 vote,
the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor Gray asked where this project is located. Jack Sweeney, GINOVUS, said that there
are several facilities, including 20 N. Meridian and 433 N. Capitol. Councillor Gray asked how
many dollars will be given up in property taxes. Mr. Sweeney said that it is $4 million.
Councillor Gray asked if this is per year. Mr. Sweeney said that this is over the total 10-year
period of the exemption.

20

May 13, 2013

Councillor Mahern asked what the prior abatement amount was that was granted to ExactTarget,
Inc. Mr. Sweeney said that he is not sure. Councillor Mahern asked if it was similar to this. Mr.
Sweeney said that it would have been somewhat proportionate. Councillor Mahern said that they
just considered a proposal to study increasing residential property tax bills in a time when the
budget is tight and they cannot afford to hire more police officers. Yet proposals like these hand
out millions of dollars, with complete total tax forgiveness, when revenues are so scarce. He said
that there is already a tax increment financing (TIF) district downtown, and therefore, an already
heavy tax burden. He asked his colleagues not to support the proposal.
Councillor Miller asked how many jobs this proposal will bring or maintain and said if this does
not occur, Exact Target could take their dollars and investment anywhere, where deals might even
be better. Mr. Sweeney said that they created 500 jobs with their last project and propose 1,088
jobs will be retained and 500 new jobs created with this project.
Councillor Cain said that Exact Target has their world headquarters downtown, with 1500
employees, and they have invested in this City and are committed to staying downtown. She said
that this investment is sure to garner even more, and they will hire up to 300 employees this year
alone, keeping downtown viable.
Councillor Adamson said that they are committed to bringing 500 new jobs to Marion County at
an average salary of $49 an hour. This will help to stimulate the economy, and the abatement
does not exist, because property taxes on this do not exist yet. With the abatement, they are
essentially shoring up more tax revenue for the future.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if there is a clawback in the agreement if commitments are not met.
Mr. Sweeney responded in the affirmative and said that the abatement could be terminated or
repayment demanded if they fail to retain or produce the jobs or make the investments promised.
Councillor Pfisterer said that they will either get jobs or their money back, so it seems like a winwin situation to her.
Councillor Lutz asked if Exact Target reached their goals in the previous abatement. Mr.
Sweeney said that they reached their goals quicker than projected and exceeded their goal of 1088
jobs with 1100 jobs at an average of $80,000 per year.
Councillor Brown asked how many of those workers are Marion County residents. Mr. Sweeney
said that over half live in Marion County. Councllor Brown asked how many of the Marion
County workers are making the higher amounts if the total jobs average out at $49 an hour. Mr.
Sweeney said that he does not have that data with him, but there is not a big spread in the
employment ranges. Councillor Brown asked how much it would cost to move their company.
Mr. Sweeney said that it is not a matter of moving, because they want to continue to make
investments in downtown Indianapolis.
Councillor Mascari asked how people can go about applying for these jobs. Mr. Sweeney said
that he can get the information to the Council.
Councillor Mahern said that the government is run by property tax and income taxes. The
testimony has been that half of these jobs will not pay income tax in Marion County. That means
some will live in property whose taxes do not support the infrastructure downtown. He said that
it is nice to say so many jobs were created, but they need to hold these businesses‚Äô feet to the fire.
He said that they have already partnered with them, and now as long as they are here, they will

21

Journal of the City-County Council

want the city to invest in them every time they want to create another job. He said that this is not
sustainable, and he strongly opposes the proposal.
Councillor Adamson said that the ratios of gain versus cost were talked about in committee, and
asked what the cost is versus the gain in income tax even with only 50% of these new employees
contributing in Marion County. Mr. Sweeney said that he does not have those numbers.
Councillor Adamson said that he thinks it was for every dollar they give up, they gain $3.
Councillor Hickman said that she is torn about abatements, but being realistic, they are spending
about $3,000 per employee.
Councillor Hunter said that the study commision has nothing to do with this proposal, and
Councillor Mahern has offered legislation for many bi-partisan study commissions. He said that
it is a good thing, and sometimes there is a fine balance when competing with the region for
economic development.
Councillor Barth stated that Exact Target is scattered all around downtown, and in many historic
buildings, keeping certain areas strong. They could move to other areas where there is more
engineering talent. There are other tangibles at play, because the feedback is that they are
attracting talent from the cost and keeping graduates from Indiana and Purdue University in
Indiana, when they might otherwise go elsewhere.
Councillor Sandlin agreed and said that the technical community is beating up the city all the time
for not protecting these technical companies in a very competitive environment. He said that just
this evening they honored young technical minds at Arsenal Tech High School, the reading rock
stars and through Tamika Catchings‚Äô foundation. He said that they need to bring well-paying
jobs to Indianapolis to keep the brains from going elsewhere.
Councillor Gray asked what happens when they give up all their tax dollars and the streets
deteriorate and everyone moves out to Hamilton County. He said that this could happen if they
continue to give away tax dollars.
Councillor McQuillen asked what Councillor Hickman meant when she said it was costing them
$3,000 per taxpayer. Councillor Hickman said that it was costing them $3,000 for each
employee, based on 1500 employees.
Councillor Oliver asked if they will no longer pay taxes downtown. Mr. Sweeney said that they
will continue to pay taxes downtown, and the abatement is just for the additional investment. He
said that the estimated value in the new investment is $3.3 million. He added that 67% of current
employees are Marion County residents. Councillor Oliver said that he does not support the
proposal.
Councillor Cain said that the total COIT projected is $619,000 per year, and the investment is $35
million with the result of $14 milllon in assessed value in the first year of oeration. During the
abatement they will pay $10,4000 annually on their existing property, and then $329,500 annually
after the abatement expires. She said that what the city is gaining outweighs the spending.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, to call the question and end debate.
Debate was ended on the following roll call vote; viz:

22

May 13, 2013

25 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Brown, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday,
Lewis, Mahern, Mansfield, Mascari, McQuillen, Miller, Moriarty Adams, Osili, Pfisterer,
Robinson, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson, Talley
4 NAYS: Hunter, Lutz, McHenry, Oliver

Councillor Robinson moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, for adoption. Proposal
No. 82, 2013 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:
24 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Hickman, Holliday, Hunter,
Lewis, Lutz, Mansfield, Mascari, McHenry, McQuillen, Miller, Moriarty Adams, Osili,
Pfisterer, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson, Talley
5 NAYS: Brown, Gray, Mahern, Oliver, Robinson

Councillor Mahern asked to explain his vote. Consent was given. Councillor Mahern told
citizens to brace themselves because there would be increased pressure on their taxes because of
the city giving their money away to businesses like this.
Proposal No. 82, 2013 was retitled GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 9, 2013, and reads as
follows:
CITY-COUNTY GENERAL RESOLUTION NO. 9, 2013
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL RESOLUTION to confirm the designation of certain real property as a high

PROPOSAL NO. 85, 2013. Councillor Brown reported that the Public Works Committee heard
Proposal No. 85, 2013 on April 18, 2013. The proposal was postponed at the full Council on
April 22, 2013. The proposal, sponsored by Councillor Gray, authorizes parking restrictions on
Pennsylvania Street from 48th to 49th Street (District 8). Councillor Brown deferred to
Councillor Gray.
Councillor Gray said that this issue has become one of the greatest parking issues he has ever
encountered while serving on the Council. He said that this has become a battle between
businesses and residents, as to who was there first and a 25-year plan one of the neighborhood
associations did. He said that the Mayor has said he would veto the proposal if it passes, which
seems silly for a parking sign. Prior to tonight‚Äôs meeting, he spoke with the director of the
Department of Public Works, and they will be meeting with businesses and neighbors to come up
with an alternative plan. He moved, seconded by Councillor McQuillen, to return Proposal No.
85, 2013 to committee. Proposal No. 85, 2013 was returned to committee on the following roll
call vote; viz:
29 YEAS: Adamson, Barth, Brown, Cain, Evans, Freeman, Gooden, Gray, Hickman, Holliday,

Adams, Oliver, Osili, Pfisterer, Robinson, Sandlin, Scales, Shreve, Simpson

time to come up with a solution.
PROPOSAL NO. 108, 2013. Councillor Moriarty Adams reported that the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee heard Proposal No. 108, 2013 on May 1, 2013. The proposal,
sponsored by Councillor Moriarty Adams, amends the Code to add a new member to the
domestic violence fatality review team from a domestic violence coordinated community
response organization. By a 7-0 vote, the Committee reported the proposal to the Council with
the recommendation that it do pass.
Councillor McQuillen asked if the current make-up of the team is fifteen members. Councillor
Moriarty Adams said that there are currently nine members, with the option to go up to 15
members. This change will make it 10 members.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Talley, for adoption. Proposal No.
108, 2013 was adopted on the following roll call vote; viz:

APPENDIX D
MITIGATION ALTERNATIVES
Appendix B includes information from a handout used in Meeting #3 of the Hazard Mitigation
Planning Committee to identify and prioritize mitigation actions.

Categories of Mitigation Actions
FEMA‚Äôs publication Developing the Mitigation Plan emphasizes the following six categories of
mitigation activities and examples:
1. Prevention: Administrative or regulatory actions/processes that influence the way land and
buildings are developed and built.
Building codes and enforcement
Floodplain development regulations
Open space preservation
Stormwater management regulations
2. Property Protection: Actions that involve the modification of existing buildings or structures
to protect them from a hazard or removal from the hazard area.
Acquisition of hazard prone structures
Construction of barriers around structures
Elevation of structures
Relocation out of hazard areas
3. Public Education and Awareness: Actions to inform and educate citizens, elected officials,
and property owners about the hazards and potential ways to mitigation them.
Public education and outreach programs
Real estate disclosure
Flood insurance
Hazard Information Centers
4 Natural Resource Protection: Actions that, in addition to minimizing hazard losses, also
preserve or restore the functions of natural systems.
Best Management Practices (BMPs)
Forest and vegetation management

AGENDA
Presentation on the 2010 Proposal to House the Emergency Operations Center at the Airport
Subpoena Production Update

REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTER INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
The Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee of the City-County Council met on
Wednesday, April 7, 2014. Chair Joseph Simpson called the meeting to order at 5:41 p.m. with the
following members present: Monroe Gray, Pamela Hickman, Benjamin Hunter, Angela Mansfield,
Frank Mascari, Janice McHenry, Vop Osili, and Marilyn Pfisterer. Representing Council staff were
General Counsel Fred Biesecker, Fiscal and Policy Analyst Ryan Kramer.
Chair Simpson stated that the purpose of the meeting is twofold. First, to hear a presentation from the
City‚Äôs former Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Director, Jim White, regarding the possibility of
establishing an Emergency Operations Center at the old airport site. The committee will also hear a
status update on document production requests related to the subpoena that was issued on March 10,
2014. Chair Simpson asked Mr. White to give a brief background of himself before beginning his
presentation.
Mr. White stated that he is a retired member of the Indiana State Police; served 37 years in the
United States Army National Guard, doing service in Iraq; worked as the Deputy Director of the
Indiana Law Enforcement Academy for six years; and served twice as the Emergency Management
Director for the City of Indianapolis. He added that he is currently a faculty member with the School
of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis (IUPUI).
Mr. White read through his presentation (attached as Exhibit A), making the following key point: He
gave the presentation to former Department of Public Safety (DPS) Director, Frank Straub, on
February 5, 2010. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was located in the Metropolitan
Emergency Communication Agency (MECA) building. The rent and utilities for EOC cost $301,185
annually. The facility did not meet the Division of Homeland Security (DHS) standards; it was
limited in size; the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system was inoperable; and
there was no covered parking for emergency management vehicles or the Special Weapons And
Tactics (SWAT) team vehicles. Mr. White stated that he looked into various locations to house EOC,
and was able to acquire facility with KITE Realty at the airport. The location was almost 22,000
square feet, of which EOC and the Operations Center (OPS) would occupy 4,112 square feet of
space; the rent would have been $9,400 per month for 15 months, and would later increase to
$19,530 per month for 105 months. The rent included utilities, and janitorial and trash services. The
landlord would reconfigure and built out the facility to the necessary specifications, costing an
estimate of $1.87 million out of the $2.3 million that was available through the Urban Area Security
Initiative (UASI) funding. The location had three levels of security: Indianapolis Metropolitan Police
Department (IMPD); airport security; and perimeter fencing, as well as surveillance cameras.
Moving to the airport location would save EOC $811,200 annually.
Fred Biesecker, General Counsel, showed a video clip of Mr. Straub‚Äôs presentation during an
Administration and Finance Committee meeting on April 26, 2011. In the clip, Mr. Straub explains
his view of the feasibility for Mr. Whites proposal.
Chair Simpson asked Mr. White to share his views on Mr. Straub‚Äôs remarks. Mr. White stated that
the current airport EOC and the City of Indianapolis are in the flight path; however, you accept
certain risks when you build things. The risk was worth the reward.
Councillor Mascari asked if EOC was locked into a long-term contract. Mr. White responded in the
negative, stating that no paperwork had been signed. Councillor Mascari asked Mr. White if he
thinks that the EOC was being handle inappropriately. Mr. White responded in the negative. He

Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee

Page 2
stated that Alex Carroll asked him to look at the facility, but explained that he felt that they were
close to moving to the airport facility. He stated that the current facility was in terrible condition with
a leaking roof, an accumulation of trash in the basement, as well as other issues. There was not
enough time to get that facility together before the Super Bowl came to the City.
Councillor Hickman asked why covered parking was needed. Mr. White stated that the emergency
response vehicles needed to be in a covered area with electrical outlets to keep them warm, which
helped make the response time faster and lengthen the life of the vehicle. Councillor Hickman asked
if the ROC was moved to the airport facility, when would it have been ready for operation. Mr.
White stated that it would have been ready in July of the same year.
Councillor Mansfield asked Mr. White if he was present during the final discussions of where the
ROC would be located. Mr. White responded in the negative, as Mr. Straub released him from his
position before the decision was made.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if the Airport Board was amenable to having the ROC at the airport. Mr.
White stated that he did not speak with the Airport Board directly and was not sure if anyone else
had. Councillor Pfisterer stated that, from her understanding, the airport had other plans for the
property.
Councillor Mansfield asked the name of the landlord of the airport facility. Mr. White stated the
facility belonged to Kite Realty. Councillor Mansfield asked if there would have been an issue with
the City moving forward with the proposal to house the ROC in the facility. Mr. White responded in
the negative.
Chair Simpson asked how close it was to having the lease signed when Mr. Straub arrived to DPS.
Mr. White stated that the lease was not signed; however, he was at the point of furnishing the new
facility.
Councillor Hunter asked Mr. Biesecker if he received a lease from the airport. Mr. Biesecker stated
that he saw the proposed lease containing the terms of the agreement and was signed by Paul Kite.
Councillor Gray stated that it is good to at the the lease from the airport facility and the lease from
the current location in order to compare the pros and cons of each, and the missteps that could have
been prevented.
Chair Simpson asked if the airport lease came before the Administration and Finance Committee for
consideration. Mr. Biesecker stated that the lease for the airport facility was not introduced.
Chair Simpson thanked Mr. White for his presentation. He then asked Mr. Biesecker to provide an
update on the document production and any compliance with the March 10th subpoena.
Mr. Biesecker read through the list of documents that have been received (attached as Exhibit B). He
stated that more documents have been received; however, there are still significant gaps in the
production, such as receiving a limited number of project inspection reports from the City. The City
produced emails to and from Mr. Straub for a period between April 12th and April 26th of 2011;
however, the City has not produced the requested emails to and from Tom Micalack and John Maze.
Lastly, the City says that it has been unable to locate any communications between Mr. Carroll and

Regional Operations Center Investigating Committee
April 7, 2014
Page 3
the City for the period of March 18th through June 23rd of 2011. Mr. Biesecker stated that it has be
five months since the original Document Request had been served, and it has been two weeks since
the deadline to produce documents in response to the subpoena. Mr. Biesecker suggested that the
committee recommend the full Council to adopt a resolution directing the Clerk of the Council to
present the matter to the Marion Circuit Court, which is permitted by State Statute.
Councillor Gray asked if enough information has been submitted to begin discussions on the
direction in which the committee is going. Mr. Biesecker stated that they are closer than they
previously; however, a lot of documents are missing, so in order to avoid jumping to conclusions, it
is best to proceed with the collection of the missing items.
Councillor Gray moved, seconded by Councillor Mascari, that the committee recommend that the
full council adopt a resolution ordering the Clerk of the Council to immediately present to the Marion
Circuit Court a written report of the facts relating to the administration‚Äôs refusal to produce
documents in compliance with the March 10, 2014 subpoena, and to seek a court order requiring
production of the documents and all other proper relief. The motion carried by a vote of 6-3, with
Councillors Hunter, McHenry and Pfisterer casting the negative votes.
Councillor Hunter asked to see the resolution, as it has to be introduced. Mr. Biesecker stated that the
resolution will be introduced at the full Council meeting on April 14th. Councillor Hunter asked if the
resolution will be deferred back to the ROC Committee. Mr. Biesecker stated that the Council will
make that decision; however, he does not want to delay the process. He added that the resolution will
state the motion provided by Councillor Gray, which is included in the Statute.
Councillor Mansfield stated that resolution will be introduced like other Council resolutions, and
would be then presented on the agenda at the next Council meeting, which is when Councillors will
review the actual verbiage stating what the resolution is.
Councillor Hunter asked under what category will the resolution be considered. Mr. Biesecker stated
that the resolution will be as a Council resolution.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Regional Operations Center
Investigating Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:46 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Joseph Simpson, Chair

Join us in planning Elkhart‚Äôs future
ELKHART (September 20, 2016) ‚Äì The city of Elkhart is launching a citywide branding campaign modeled after
the success of SoMa, the community-driven initiative for revitalization in downtown Elkhart. The new initiative
aims to attract business and industry throughout the city, thus improving the overall appeal of all Elkhart
neighborhoods.
The success of SoMa was due in large part to a high level of community engagement. Now, the city needs residents,
leaders and advocates to help in the branding of Elkhart‚Äôs other business redevelopment districts.
The city is hoping to hear from residents about the qualities and characteristics that make each neighborhood
unique. To facilitate this, the city will be hosting four branding meetings. These meetings are open to all interested
members of the community.
