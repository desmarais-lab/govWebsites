

ERP Physical Host Migration to CCB: On May 12th, we successfully went
live with the PeopleSoft System in our environment. We did have just 2
minor issues but were able to resolve both of those very quickly. We now
have greater visibility into the system which will give us the ability to
better manage and response and optimize the system. We are also
experiencing an improvement in performance. We have received multiple
accolades from our customers due to the improvement in performance.
I’d like to thank the entire PeopleSoft Team: Mike Darland, Chris
Sherrow, Bob Radford, Matt Darland, Bhumi Shah, Bijitha Joseph, Tina
Felix, Sarah Edrington, Candice Moor, Kimberly Cartwright, Nithya
Soundararajan, Michelle Taylor, John Crone, MaryLou Eades, Sravan
Patharla, Soundappan Murugesan and Mark Mitchell. With a special
thanks to Donna Shank, ERP Team Manager. I’d also like to thank many
of our customers who were instrumental in helping us test to ensure the
system was sound and ready for Go Live: Shirley Mizen, Lori Hupp,
Donell Shivers, Delight Morgan, Chuck White, April Schulteis, David
Condon and Nathan Manners. Additionally, my thanks to our vendor’s
partners: Atos, DAI, Vendita and EnTap.

For the month of February:
 DAI met all of their established SLAs.
 Atos met 41 of their established SLAs and missed 10. While they did miss 2 more
this month over last, there were anomalies during the month of April which
resulted in missed SLAs. ISA receives requests on a periodic basis to image and
setup temporary devices and/or move a series of devices for specific events. In
any given month, these requests do not typically exceed 10 to 12 devices.
During the month of April, we received over 250 requests for temporary device
imaging and setup and over 90 requests for device moves. These requests came
for specific events such as May Election, Odyssey Training, OMS Training,
CAD/RMS Training, IMPD Recruiting, and others. While all of the requests were
valid, it was a significant and unusual increase in requests that resulted in Atos
missing 5 SLAs. Given that all of those requests were specific to the Deskside
Services Team and this increased work also had a negative effect on the 3
missed Deskside SLAs. Contractually, Atos will be assessed penalties for any
SLAs they miss 2 months in a row and this is the 1st month that they will have
financial penalties. Missed SLAs were as follows:

Deskside Priority 2 Tickets
Deskside Priority 3 Tickets

As a means of collecting customer satisfaction data, Atos sends out surveys after the
completion of a Service Desk ticket. For the month of April, 340 surveys were returned
for an overall Average Satisfaction Rating of 4.5 out of 5. Of the 340 surveys, 313 were
rated as Positive and 27 as Negative. This is the highest number of customer
satisfaction surveys that we have received in any month to date. We received 180 more
surveys in April over March. Top 3 agency Customer Satisfaction details for the Month

June 2014 ISA Project Summary Report

Current Project Summary Descriptions
2015 Chargeback Redesign
This project will define the 2015 ISA Service Catalog
and design the new chargeback model for applications
within the enterprise. The new model will utilize ISA’s
consumption data and provide more usage-based
pricing for ISA customers in 2015.

Accounts Receivable will be the last module
implemented into PeopleSoft. This module includes an
interface for Cash Management.
False Alarm Tracking & Reporting
Develop a new application to replace the IMPD legacy
application developed in VB 6 to track, monitor and
report on false alarm runs. Add the functionality
necessary to allow IFD to track their false alarm runs
as well. Accurate tracking and reporting of these runs
could result in significant revenue for the respective
departments. This project will be deployed in multiple
iterations using the agile methodology. IFD’s
component will be developed first while the current
IMPD application is analyzed and reengineered.

DPW Traffic Signal Network and System Upgrade
ISA will assist DPW Engineering’s upgrade of the
traffic signal network and signal management system.
The project has three major components: network
devices at intersections and in the ISA data center,
fiber optic cable under City streets, and traffic signal
monitoring software. The network will be supported by
DPW and ISA. The estimated project completion date
has been revised to July 2014.

Marion County Property Card Assessor’s Portal
This project will add the Property Card containing
Marion County property assessed values to existing
“GIS – Public facing application” which currently
provides other parcel property information.

DEXTER Development
Develop the Dexter integration engine components
required to facilitate the seven (7) data exchanges
identified as critical for the CORE (Courts Online
Records Exchange) “go live”. The components will be
designed and developed per the requirements
gathered and documented within the Process
Modeling and Use Cases document.

Mobile Device Management (MobileIron) Pilot
ISA is working to execute a mobile device
management platform pilot using an application called
MobileIron in the environment. This application will
enable ISA with a toolset to manage wireless devices
with better efficiency as well as enhancing the user
experience. This pilot will last for duration of 120 days.

Email Upgrade
ISA will be upgrading the Exchange system to a more
current release. This new release will offer us new
functionality and flexibility that currently does not exist
in our environment today.

Odyssey Conversion
Provide research, evaluation, development and
support in the conversion of criminal data stored in
JUSTIS to the new Odyssey application.

Enterprise WiFi (Private & Public)
ISA is conducting an assessment to bring an
enterprise class private and public WiFi solution into
the City County Building (and potentially campus
locations). After completion of the assessment and
determination of final solution, we will begin
communication to the enterprise as well as
implementation of the solution.

OMSe Implementation
The implementation of GTL’s Offender Management
System to replace the current Jail Inmate Management
System (JIMS). This project is being managed by the
vendor’s Project Manager, Gerry Gabler with the
assistance of DAI Application Services.
PC Refresh 2013
ISA is committed to refreshing the City/County
technology on a consistent basis to ensure our
customers are provided with the technology that will

ERP Implementation – Multiple Phases
We are implementing the final phase of the 3-year
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project.

allow them the greatest opportunities to do their work
in a speedy and cost effective manner. This project is
to upgrade our end-user devices to keep current with
new technologies. The refresh for 2013 will
encompass the devices that were not refreshed in
2012 and the majority of the devices that are due in
2013.

Voter Information Portal Enhancements
This project will provide updates to the VIP as
requested by the customer. Enhancements have been
requested to both the public-facing application as well
as the internal data maintenance application.
Windows 7 & Office 2010 Migration
ISA is committed to refreshing the City/County
technology on a consistent basis to ensure our
customers are provided with the technology that will
allow them the greatest opportunities to do their work
in a speedy and cost effective manner. This project
will upgrade our current desktop environment to
include Windows 7 for the operating system, Office
2010 for the office suite and Internet Explorer 10 for
the web browser. Over the last year, ISA has been
working directly with Microsoft to evaluate best
practices and standards for this migration as well as
create an implementation plan.

Tablet Pilot
ISA will be conducting a tablet pilot with multiple
agencies/departments within the enterprise to see if
tablets are a viable device for mobile and/or field
employees. This pilot will be conducted over
approximately 120 days with consistent monitoring and
feedback from the pilot users. At the end of the pilot,
ISA will provide the pilot findings along with any
established guidelines and/or policies, if needed, for
continued use of tablets in the enterprise.

ISA Financial Report
Mr. Baker requested that in Mr. Hood’s absence the report stand as submitted.
Overview of the ISA Financial Report covers YTD through December, 2009.
Expenses: $45,512,726 was budgeted for 2009, $33,700,647 was used YTD 09, which equals
74.0% used overall. Revenue: $35,475,421 was budgeted for 2009, $33,396,424 was received
YTD 09, which accounted for 94.1% collected. The 2009 budget includes approximately $6.6
million in prior year purchase orders which are still active and of that amount nearly $4.3 million
has been spent. ISA records revenue in the year received. This includes payments received from
the 4th Qtr 2008 billings and approximately $1.2 million from a prior year grant. There is also
approximately $1 million in prior year revenue that we could receive this year from a fiscal
ordinance.
The 3 main Service Areas show a total of $12,798,412 spent for YTD Nov 09 compared to
$12,726,579 for YTD Dec 08. This made for a $71,833 variance.

Poll locator with polling place photos maps, driving directions and enhanced aerial

February 2010 ISA Report Summary
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

C u r r e n t P r o j e c t S u m m a r y D e s c r i p ti o n s
Accela Automation
Implementation of a land management system.
Accela will replace many legacy systems and institute
automation into several manual processes. Major
project stakeholders include Department of
Metropolitan Development, Department of Code
Enforcement and Marion County Health and Hospital.
We are currently implementing basic Accela
functionality and business licensing “lite” for DCE and
HHC

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) – Business
Requirements and Solution Selection
The scope of this initiative is to gather detailed
requirements for an ERP implementation, select an
ERP Solution, select an implementation provider
(Integrator), and negotiate solutions and
implementation contracts.
Hansen Map Viewer
This web-based application will provide DPW
employees with the ability to view and analyze Hansen
IMS work item information created within the GIS via
the new Hansen Mapping Workflow service. The
application will also provide the ability to retrieve
associated work order cost information by executing
existing queries into the Hansen system via a custom
web service wrapper.

Citizen Service Web Portal
This project will create an on-line, web-based citizen
portal for a wide variety of city/county services. The
project will include upgrading the capability of our
back-end CRM system. The new on-line portal will
ultimately include multi-lingual and map capabilities.
Phase 1 includes the ability to enter and status service
requests for our top ten services using either text or
map based services.

Integrated Regional Information System (IRIS)
A centralized database to properly identify criminals
and suspects that officers come into contact with. The
goal is to be able to pull data from other surrounding
county policing applications in order to have a
complete history background on an individual.
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is
initiating collaboration with 30 surrounding counties to
participate in the IRIS project which is grant funded.

Courts HR & Payroll
Implementation of Microsoft GP to upgrade the Marion
Superior Courts (MSC) Human Resource and Payroll
systems. Implementation of a Grants module will also
be included in phase two of the project.
Downtown Wireless Technical Evaluation
The objective of this initiative is to provide technical
designs, cost estimates and preliminary build-out plans
for applicable downtown wireless network alternatives.
The downtown wireless network must address current
and future public safety requirements as well as other
city/county applications that can benefit from wireless
networks (i.e. parking meters, mobile workforce and
Super Bowl information kiosks). We have asked
Northrop Grumman, our network services vendor, to
provide a study proposal.

Indy.gov Redesign and Implementation
Indy.gov is the major source of information and
services for the citizens of Indianapolis and Marion
County. The current design is not visibly attractive,
fails to meet usability standards and requires
enhancement to support our drive to make Indy.gov a
citizen service site. This project will be a crossfunctional effort that will include research, planning,
site design, development, implementation and
marketing.

eFiling (Marion Superior Court)
The Marion Superior Court requires each case to be
filed in JUSTIS. Two case types MF (mortgage and
foreclosures) and CC (civil collections) make up 67%
of the cases filed. MSC is looking to provide an option
for law firms file these cases electronically through
Lexis/Nexis and then pass the data to JUSTIS. This
project must maneuver through a maze of approvals
through the Indiana Supreme Court and local rules to
allow such an electronic process.

IT Consolidation Study
The purpose of this project is for the Chief Information
Officer to identify opportunities for efficiencies,
including cost savings and increase information
security, to be gained by further consolidation of
information technology support services throughout
the city and county government. The CIO will report
back to the council on the findings and
recommendations. This projected is mandated by
proposal no.475, 2009.

OCC Contracts Document Management
The document management project is an opportunity
for OCC and Purchasing to make documents available
online to the public. This project will also allow for
OCC and Purchasing to more efficiently access their
internal working documents. The project scope
includes 1) scanning all contracts initiated in 2007
forward as well as all open contracts, 2) redacting all
scanned contracts except 2007 and 3) publishing all
scanned contracts except 2007, 4) implementing the
processes required to scan, redact and publish new
contracts going forward.

menu structure, emphasis will be placed on providing
training resources to users throughout the project.
PVD Property System
This initiative is to implement and migrate to a new
PVDNet property tax system running in a distributed
computing architecture. The scope includes
supporting the Tax Reconciliation initiatives and
aggressive tasks to get the tax billing process back on
schedule. The major stakeholders on this project are
the Treasurer, Auditor, and Assessor.
Wide Area Network (WAN) Services Migration
The objective of this initiative is to migrate off of the
end-of-life legacy frame-relay circuits to a robust,
scalable infrastructure that will immediately lower costs
and improve service.

Office 2007 Implementation
This initiative will upgrade Office 2003 to Office 2007
in all City / County Agencies. Office 2007 will provide
City / County employees with enhanced tools and
features while keeping the enterprise current on a
Microsoft supported Office Productivity package.
Office 2007 has been available to early adopters for
some time but we are currently planning a more
aggressive roll-out that will take place department by
department. Rolling out in phases will allow us to test
each department’s Office macros and existing
applications to insure compatibility. Because Office
2007 includes a new look and feel, most notably a new

Regional Emergency Operations Center
The purpose of this initiative is to relocate the
City/County’s primary Emergency Operations Center
(EOC) to a facility that is better designed for housing
and operating the services. The new EOC may be
made available to other local governments.

Executive Summary
Marion County Treasurer’s Office – Visa Tax Payment Program
Introduction
Local Government Indiana Online (LoGO) has been requested to add a new Visa debit payment option to
the Web and IVR Property Tax Payment Applications for the Marion County Treasurer’s Office. The new
Visa Tax Payment Program (effective October 4, 2008) replaces the old Visa Tax Pilot Program which has
concluded.
Approach
Variable (percentage based) fees are allowed except on Visa Debit Cards where a fixed fee must be
applied and must not be greater than $3.95 for certain tax payments. The enhanced access fee transaction
and the County/City Fee transaction must be submitted as separate transactions on the citizen’s receipt.
LoGO Indiana, in accordance with the new Visa rules and acceptance into the program, will provide tax
payers with three payment options; credit card ($2.50 plus 2%), eCheck ($2.50 flat rate) and Visa Tax Debit
Payment ($3.95). All payments currently display as separate line items on the citizen’s receipt; one for tax
fee and one for enhanced access and processing fees. The requested fees for this service are a $3.95 flat
fee per property tax payment for Web and IVR services when a Visa Debit Card is used. LoGO Indiana will
have access to a lookup table provided by Visa to ensure the card is a Visa Debit Card before processing
the transaction.
Example Visa Debit Payment
Property Tax:
Processing and Enhanced Access Fee:
Total Charge:

$100.00
+ $ 3.95
$103.95

Conclusion
The EARC recommends the flat fee of $3.95 for Visa Debit Card payments be authorized by the IT Board
for tax payments made through the LoGO Indiana Web and IVR Payment Portals for property tax
payments.

RESOLUTION # 10-03
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD
Resolution to Approve Enhanced Access fees for the collection of Lobbyist Filing Fees
WHEREAS, Local Government Indiana Online (LoGO) has created a dynamic Lobbyist Registration application
which provides functionality for three user groups – the lobbyist, public, and Department of Code Enforcement
(DCE) administrators; and
WHEREAS, said Lobbyist Registration application fulfils a City/County ordinance requiring registration and
annual report filing by Lobbyists; and
WHEREAS, the new Lobbyist Registration application will not charge a fee for lobbyist to register, but, by
ordinance, will charge One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for online annual filing; and
WHEREAS, the DCE has elected to pay for hosting of the Lobbyist Registration application by deducting credit
card processing fees and enhanced access fees totalling $5.50 from the annual filing fee paid by Lobbyists; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Information Technology Board authorizes the deduction of
enhanced access and credit card processing fees totalling $5.50 from the Lobbyist Filing Fee to pay for hosting
of the Lobbyist Registration application.

Executive Summary
Lobbyist Annual Report Filing Fee
Introduction
The City of Indianapolis-Marion County has introduced an ordinance which will require lobbyists to
register and file a report with the City/County on an annual basis. A lobbyist is defined as any individual
who is primarily employed and receives payment, or who contracts for financial consideration, exceeding
one thousand dollars ($1,000) in any calendar year, for the purpose of engaging in lobbying activity.
Utilizing the online Lobbyist Application currently used by the State of Indiana will allow the City/County
to collect fees and information needed to ensure lobbyist compliance.
Local Government Indiana Online (LoGO) has deployed a dynamic application which provides functionality
for three user groups – lobbyists, the public, and the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE). The new
Lobbyist Application will:
•
•
•
•
•

Allow for filing and payment of annual reports
Allow registrant login
Allow editing of registrant information
Allow a registrant to have multiple employers, parties of interest, and subject matters
Allow searching for registrant information and filed annual reports by the public

Approach
Since the DCE would like all lobbyist registration and annual filing to occur through the new system, the
fees for the service will be absorbed by the agency and not passed on to the user. The requested fees
for payment processing for lobbyists filing their annual report (registration is free) for this service are:
•

$3.50 per each transaction processed for credit cards plus 2% processing fees incurred for
processing payments. These enhanced access fees mirror the fees for the Business Licensing
Applications already in use by the DCE for select license types.
Example Credit/Debit Card Payment for Annual Filing for Lobbyists
Filing Fee (to end user):
$100.00
2% processing fee:
- $ 2.00
Subtotal:
$98.00
Credit Enhanced Access Fee:
- $ 3.50
Total Deposit to DCE:
$94.50

Conclusion
The EARC recommends the fee of $3.50 plus 2% be authorized by the IT Board and netted off from the
total statutory fee for Lobbyists filing their annual report through the new online service.

Executive Summary
Online Document Access Application Funding

Introduction
Local Government Online, Indiana (LoGO) is pursuing a partnership with Open Portal Solutions (OPS) and
presented a proposal to create an online document access application for the Department of Code Enforcement
(DCE) and Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD). This application will make documents approved
for public record currently stored in a FileNet document management system available to the public
electronically. Funding for development of the application will come from the Enhanced Access Fund and has
been approved by the Enhanced Access Review Committee (EARC)
Approach
The DCE and DMD have been storing various types of documents related to code enforcement, planning and
historic preservation electronically in a FileNet document management system for many years. This system now
contains hundreds of thousands of documents. DCE and DMD receive requests for copies of these documents
on a daily basis with DCE devoting half an FTE to the fulfillment of these requests. DCE and DMD believe that
providing online access to these documents will help them reduce their costs and/or staff time as well as
increase government transparency.
LoGO and OPS worked with DCE and DMD staff to determine the requirements for an online document access
application that would meet the needs of the staff and public. Their proposal includes taking the code base of
OPS’ NE Web Portal Solution used by IDEM for access to their documents stored in FileNet and modifying it
to meet the needs of the City/County. The cost to design, develop, install and train internal users of the
application is $99,500. A fee structure for use of the application by the public to retrieve documents is being
proposed separately to cover the cost of hosting and maintenance and support of the application. LoGO will
utilize their Payment Engine to process payments for online documents downloaded through the NE Web
Portal.
The DEC and DMD approached the Enhanced Access Review Committee to seek funding for this through the
Enhanced Access Fund. The EARC approved authorizing up to $99,500 from the Enhanced Access Fund to
cover the development costs.
Conclusion
The EARC recommends that the IT Board authorize the expenditure of $99,500 to cover the development costs
of an Online Document Access application for the Department of Code Enforcement and Department of
Metropolitan Development to be developed and hosted by OPS, but will be maintained and managed under the
LoGO Indiana Contract.

Executive Summary
Enhanced Access Fees for Online Document Access
Introduction
Local Government Online, Indiana (LoGO) and Open Portal Solutions (OPS) are creating an application to allow
access to documents stored in a FileNet document management system by the Department of Code Enforcement
(DCE) and the Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD). Funding for developing and deploying the
application has been proposed to come from the Enhanced Access Fund. Funding for ongoing hosting, maintenance
and support of the application is proposed to come from enhanced access fees charged to users of the application.
Approach
The DCE and DMD have been storing various types of documents related to code enforcement, planning and historic
preservation electronically in a FileNet document management system for many years. This system now contains
hundreds of thousands of documents. DCE and DMD receive requests for copies of these documents on a daily basis
with DCE devoting half an FTE to the fulfillment of these requests. Currently, for requests fulfilled by staff,
customers are charged $0.04 per page for printing on letter, legal and ledger sized paper. For documents larger than 11
x 17 an additional fee of $4.00 is imposed and a fee of $10.00 is charged for the creation of a CD if the customer
wants the documents in electronic form.
Since customers are currently charged on a per page basis, DCE, DMD and LoGO looked into a similar pricing
structure for electronic access to these documents. However, the page count of the documents is not an attribute that is
stored in the FileNet system. Additionally, the types of document stored in FileNet by DCE and DMD vary
considerably in length. While one document of a given type (e.g. a permit application) may be only a page or two,
another of the same type may be dozens or even hundreds of pages long. Due to the lack of information on document
length and the inherent variability, DCE, DMD and LoGO determined it would not be feasible to create a pricing
structure rooted in document length. Instead they have proposed a fee structure based on the number of documents
requested by the customer. The fees proposed are detailed in EARC Service Request #42. They include pricing for
instant access (credit card) users on page 4 of that document and proposed pricing for monthly subscribers on page 5.
Pricing for instant access users includes a 2% credit card processing fee. This is the average credit card processing fee
imposed by the merchant banks on LoGO’s parent company NIC which processes credit card payments for LoGO and
the other state portals that NIC supports around the country.
Conclusion
The EARC recommends the fee structure proposed in Service Request #42 be authorized by the IT Board.

Service Request - #42
Department of Code Enforcement, Department of Metropolitan Development, Division of Planning and
Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission- Online Access to Documents
Overview
LoGO Indiana and Open Portal Solutions (OPS) are working towards building a strategic alliance to provide
one solution where the public can access City/County information and documents approved for public
record. The project proposed for the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE) and the Department of
Metropolitan Development Division of Planning and the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission will
provide an online Portal for agency documents stored in FileNet. The information that will be made
available to the public through the solution includes, but is not limited to; building and site plans, permit
applications, certificates of occupancy, traffic studies and completion cards. In order to support the
development, maintenance, customer service and marketing for the project offered through the OPS NE
Web Portal Solution, the EARC has requested the project be completed utilizing a hybrid funding model.
Utilizing the contract LoGO Indiana has in place with the City/County will allow for the collection of user
fees for information downloads and 10% of those fee collected (after adjustments made for payment
processing) will be deposited back to the Enhanced Access Revenue Share Committee (EARC) Fund.
Business Case-Department of Code Enforcement
Requests for documents to the involved agencies and departments can come in via three methods; inperson, email and over the telephone. Research was completed on the cost savings that will be realized
for the Department of Code Enforcement if the information was placed online. On a monthly basis, the
Department of Code Enforcement dedicates one staff member to research and complete the requests for
information from citizens and businesses. This staff member dedicates 50% of their time each day to
fulfilling these requests, at a cost of approximately $35,000 a year to the DCE.
The dedicated DCE staff person fulfills requests and charges the customer $.04 per page for printing on
regular sized paper (documents larger than 11 x 17 have an additional printing charge of $4.00) and a
$10.00 fee for the creation of a CD if the customer would like the information in electronic form. In
order to try and reduce these costs and have staff focus on mission critical services, the DCE has
requested an online Portal be created that allows access to documents currently stored in FileNet. The
cost savings to the Department of Metropolitan Development, Division of Planning and the Indianapolis
Historic Preservation Commission are still under review.
Target Audience
Many of the requests for information come from three user groups;
•
•
•

Land-Use Attorneys
Contractors
Citizens who need information to make improvements or changes to their home

Monthly Account Agreement Holder Pricing
With a $99,500 investment to build the Online Document Access Portal for DCE and DMD, LoGO Indiana
and OPS will explore the possibility of including a Monthly Account Agreement Holder pricing model.
Pricing for monthly account agreement holders is discounted and will allow frequent users to be billed
monthly. Currently, LoGO Indiana charges a $50 per year fee to users for a monthly account agreement.
As an added benefit to adding the subscriber process to the service, qualifying organizations, such as
non-profits and Community Development Corporations can apply for waivers to receive this information
free of charge. Pricing for non-waiver qualifying Monthly Account Agreement Holders is listed below.
Qualifying agencies would pay nothing, both the annual $50 fee and the price per document would be
provided free of charge. In 2009, LoGO Indiana processed almost 60,000 waived transactions through the
IndyBiz Portal.

Agency Cost Savings
Directing requests for information to the Web Portal will help save the DCE $9,000 per year with a 25%
adoption rate. If the adoption rate for this service increases to 50%, the DCE will realize $18,000 per
year in cost savings. LoGO and OPS will generate revenue to support and maintain the service from user
fees, not from costs incurred by City/County Agencies. Utilizing the hybrid funding model will also save
the agencies approximately $20,000 on an annual basis for maintenance and support of the online
application.

EARC Revenue
Subject to LoGO Indiana’s contract with the City/County, the EARC Revenue Share Fund will receive 10%
of the adjusted gross revenue generated by transactions processed through the Web Portal for Access to
Online Documents. The 2% payment processing fees will be deducted from the total transaction and will
not be added on to each transaction processed. An example of the distribution of funds is below;
Example Transaction:
Total User Fee: $8.00
2% payment processing fee (approximate): $0.16
Fee retained by LoGO/OPS: $7.84
10% EARC Revenue Share (approximate): $0.78

Purpose
The purpose of the Microsoft Premier Support Services (PSS) agreement is to provide expertise level
support services for the Microsoft technologies that have been deployed to host and deliver mission
critical applications and services for the City/County.
Description
Microsoft Premier Support Services provides for problem resolution and proactive services including a
Technical Account Manager assigned to proactively ensure that customers are fully leveraging the
services of the agreement.
As part of the PSS proactive services program the following are risk assessment that have been and
will continue to be conducted on a periodical basis to ensure that components of the infrastructure
that are dependent on Microsoft technologies are in good health:

Notes
As the Microsoft infrastructure deployed in 2006/2007 has matured the amount of support the
City/County requires to maintain it in good health has been reduced. Accordingly ISA has adjusted
the agreement to reflect those changes. For example expenditure for the previous two years were:
•
•

2008-$205,960
2009-$193,560

ISA is now at the point of leveling off on those adjustments and expect, barring any major changes to
the infrastructure, to budget roughly the same amount for the services thru 2013.

Mr. Clifford called meeting to order at 9:34 and sought approval of the IT Board Minutes for the October 22,
2007 and October 30, 2007 meetings.
Motion to approve by Judge Collins and seconded by Mr. Morgan. Motion passed unanimously.
IT Board Business
Mr. Clifford, City Controller, stated it would be his second to last meeting and he would like to step down to allow
for a smooth transition. Ms. Shital Patel, CIO, offered the information that Ms. Linda Enders, Mayoral Appointee,
term expires December 2008, and we need to elect a new chairperson. Mr. Clifford asks if he was unable to
nominate but could participant in discussion. Mr. Kareem Howell, Legal Counsel, acknowledges that this is
correct and Ms. Beth White, Marion County Clerk, nominates Treasurer Mike Rodman and the motion was
seconded by Mr. Clifford. Mr. Clifford asked for any other nominations and seeing none the new Chairman elect
is Mr. Rodman by unanimous vote.
Mr. Rodman thanked Bob Clifford for his service and stated that Mr. Clifford has dealt with weighty issues during
his service with fairness, grace and dignity.
ISA Report
Ms. Patel reported projects completed and provided a brief overview. Election Day went quite well. On Election
Day we resolved over 1400 trouble tickets as a result of the applications by ISA. We are working currently with
the Election Board for improvements on future elections. Justis.Net and Odyssey will be discussed later today.
Accela automation has twenty percent of the configuration done. One of the bigger issues is doing all the
reporting. The Camera Project final project plan has been received and the vendor is working on site surveys.
For the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project, we are still gathering information and plan to present in
February. Property data conversion is ninety-six percent complete and going quite well. Training and testing for
the property system is in progress. Load testing will occur on Dec 6. For the email archiving project, Symantec

Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

will be onsite when it is rolled out. Standards and Policies will be discussed later today. There are 47 Virtual
servers on 9 boxes. We did have 20 on three boxes just a few months ago. Some of the new applications that
we are rolling in, for example Property system, etc. are all on the virtual server. Northrop Grumman met service
levels for two months in a row and DAI met their service levels.
Mr. Clifford commented that he worked on Election Day in the help room and ISA did an awesome job with
application. Of the 1400 issues, there were a lot which were user errors and not problems with the application.
Mr. Clifford complimented Beth on her successful election and to ISA for their application. Beth added that
everyone loves the application. Great results and it may change the whole way the future elections will run from
now on. The DAI team did a great job.
Financial Report
Mr. Aaron Hood, CFO presented the financial report, which contains 3 areas. First area is the Budget
comparison for Oct 07 vs. Oct 06. ISA has spent just under $26 million of the $38 million allocated for this year,
which is roughly 67.9 percent. We have identified and encumbered dollars for projects and equipment we plan
to purchase throughout the remainder of this year. You will see the total expenditure numbers go up as we finish
this year. For the Revenue section, out of the projected revenue of $28.4 million, we have collected year to date
just shy of $22 million, which is 76.2 percent of budget. As dollars come in we record them – i.e. cash basis of
accounting. The final section in the report is the contract comparison for the major 3 service areas which is just
a little over $8.6 million year to date this year vs. last year was $8.8 million. In addition, you might note that we
are going back to Council for appropriations to reimburse our budget in December. It is due to the fact of the
“Double Budgeting,” as Mr. Clifford has referred to it; ISA will seek to recover dollars spent by other agencies
throughout the year which we hadn’t planned on within our ISA budget. Mr. Rodman asked if we were going to
be this much under budget by the end of the year. Mr. Hood stated he did not think we would be since we have
encumbered the remaining dollars. There are projects and equipment purchases that we will expend in the last
2 months of November and December. Ms. Patel stated that we would have some under spending in Character
1. When we ask for the fiscal ordinance, instead of asking for appropriations from departments, we will use
some of the Character 1 under spending to offset. There is roughly $200,000 we will have in under spending in
Character 1 this year.
Action Items
Resolution 07-17 GIS Woolpert
Ms. Barbara Thompson, Contract Manager ISA, requested the Board approval for Woolpert, as it was tabled last
month. Ms. Thompson reiterated the request of Mr. Ron Meadows, Marion County Sheriff’s Department, from
last month’s IT Board meeting that the contract go out for bid next renewal and request is duly noted in the
contract file.
Mr. Clifford made a motion and Mrs. Enders second the motion- Passed unanimously.
Resolution 07-20 AT&T/Centrex
Mr. Ken Sorenson, CTO, presented his overview for emergency phone service. These are through Centrex and
hardwired back to the central switch. This system is used for alarms and other things that require a hardwire
service. Ms. Patel stated that AT&T is single provider that provides this service.
After discussion & questions from the board, there was a motion to approve made by Mrs. Enders and
seconded by Mr. Clifford and the motion passed unanimously.
Discussion Items
Case Management Update: Amber Watkins and Rick Petrecca present the Case Management Solution
The Justis.Net project is pending considering our review and continuing with the scripting process. Need to
identify new users to bring in for the scripting sessions. Analyzing reports to prioritize by viewing the number of
users touching panels and number of times touched. Mr. Rick Petrecca, SA3 Manager, spoke about Justis
enhancement requests and using the new E-Citation system. The State will be sending us this information in
electronic format. This is not currently compatible with how Justis is set up. We will have to modify the Justis
Information Services Agency – Document: ISA-ITBD Meeting Minutes

Page 2 of 4

Information Technology Board
November 27, 2007 Meeting Minutes
system to allow us to process the cases. Currently we get one charge per ticket; with the new system it could be
up to four charges per ticket. Ms. White explained that UTT means Uniformed Traffic Ticket. This application is
much faster and a great application and hopeful to use in a more global way. Judge Collins said that in other
courts, especially the misdemeanour court and some felony, a lot of the other charges accompany the UTT
tickets. This is work that we must do to our current mainframe Justis System as explained by Mr. Petrecca. It is
being taken into account by the Odyssey System. If we move forward with Justis.Net, we will translate this new
code and it will carry forward. If we move forward with Odyssey, then that is taken care of by the state. Mr.
Morgan asked how many people hours we have saved by using this system. Rick offered that we have not
measured, but paper tickets that cost money will eventually disappear and this is very significant. A future
comparison for Justis.Net and Odyssey are taking place and hope to bring to the January Board. Time and cost
comparison can be offered by a rough idea of comparison between two solutions. A true time and cost analysis
would need additional resources be working hand in hand with JTEC and Tyler resources.
Standards and Policy Update
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. John Chavez, SA2 Manager, presented the Standards of IT Industry and updates for the
New Desktop Standard.
Laptop Standards: Better, faster and pricing wise – we are not paying additional cost. The price for new model is
roughly same cost as old model.
Tablet Standard: Aggressively priced and comes with a docking station if necessary. It meets specific needs in
environment.
We are in the pilot phase of Thin Client. Tablets will only be used if dictated by the environment. We wanted to
set a standard so if we use in the future. Motion made to accept the proposed new standards by Mr. Meadows
and second by Mr. Clifford. Motion passes.
Energy Management
Mr. Chavez discussed the Mayors’ office energy conservation policy. At the time we reviewed the policy and
sought to see where we were in compliance. Using our remote management software tools we have set the
remote management to comply with policy. We are not adding any software we are just going in and adjusting
power settings. Monitors will now power down after ten minutes of inactivity and processor moves into standby
after one hour of no activity and two hours will move to the hibernate mode. The periods are consistent with
policy. Cost saving in energy cost based on kilowatt-hour is estimated at $206,000. We can really make an
impact by pushing these savings out. Other benefits energy use and energy cost can be reduce from $1.9
million to $780,000 by making this change happen. The stated exceptions were few. Laptops are not part of this
policy.
Technology Update - Thin Client
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. John Chavez passed around equipment for the Board to experience hands on and more
closely view. The Thin Client device is basically a terminal into a windows machine where applications run on a
central server which allows you deploy the Thin Client almost anywhere including locations that may not have a
high speed connection. Other advantages are that data is stored on a server and not on a desktop machine.
Benefits also include the cost of the device plus power savings - there is an estimated 87% savings in power
consumption versus a standard desktop. Device is administered remotely and the user cannot do anything to
change the configuration of the device thereby making the unit less susceptible to viruses. Ms. Patel injected
that there is less of an incentive to steal since the unit will not operate without a server. Management cost will go
down since the unit is centrally managed. Mr. Bowes went through all applications that would be operated
through the Thin Client; however, desktops will still be needed for GIS and certain applications that will not run
on the Thin Client. Dr. Inui offered that he is an enthusiast for this device. Cautioned also that we are using
Citrix and Thin Clients, but virtualized server network does slow down client response time as utilization goes
up.

finished Phase 1 of gathering high level business
requirements from OFM, Purchasing, Office of the
Auditor, MC Clerk, IMPD, MC Treasurer, and DPW.
Currently, the project is in Phase 2 where ISA is
gathering market research information on available
ERP software options to determine levels of
customer service, cost and support. Next, ISA will
explore best practices in the market to discover what
organizations and other governmental agencies are
using to improve their financial operations. The
initial draft of the Market Research Report is
targeted for completion the end of January 08.

On-Going Projects
Criminal/Civil Case Management:
Justis.NET: ISA identified additional users to
bring in for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) scripting
sessions based upon report analysis. The team is in
the process of scheduling UAT scripting sessions
with those users. The development team submitted
an updated task list with completion estimates to be
included in an overall project estimate.
Odyssey: The review process is continuing. The
review team is preparing a feature comparison and
risk comparison of Odyssey and JUSTIS.net. The
team is also working toward a rough estimate for
cost and time for Odyssey while the JUSTIS.net
project team is preparing an estimate for the
completion of JUSTIS.net.

FileNet Upgrade: A project kick-off meeting was
held on November 27th, which included ISA, NG,
DAI, DMD Planning and DMD Compliance
representatives, as well as Prescient personnel.
The Prescient services include the installation and
configuration of FileNet P8 on ISA/ NG servers,
conversion of existing FileNet document storage
from optical to magnetic media, and an IndiDocs
Gap Analysis. The IndiDocs Gap Analysis will
indicate whether development of an additional
IndiDocs replacement software package is
necessary to act as a document revision agent, in
addition to the new FileNet P8 software capabilities.
Installation is to be completed by December 31,
2007.

Accela Automation: Analysis is 95% complete. The
configuration phase (updates to Accela to meet Indy
requirements) is 18% complete. Interfaces are 15%
complete. Efforts for report development are 7%
complete (total reports effort). The project is yellow
for the following reasons:
• Delays with deliverable finalization &
acceptance
• Finalization of interface roles &
responsibilities
• DMD / Compliance move & holiday
vacations/benefit leave
The team will reevaluate Project Schedule / dates
such that we can evaluate go-live options including
phased go-live & schedule extension

Municipal Wireless Feasibility Study: This
feasibility study continues to move forward.
Interviews are proceeding as planned with three of
the eight scheduled for the first round complete.
Preliminary feedback from stakeholders has been
positive with all three of the initial interviewees
expressing interest, agreeing that this feasibility
study is needed to aggregate and understand the
demand for municipal wireless. They also indicated
their desire to participate in a brainstorming session
about the types of applications that would provide
the greatest benefits if delivered over a wireless
network. The remaining interviews with City/County
stakeholder agencies are scheduled December 6th &
7th. External stakeholder interviews are, as yet,
unscheduled pending the internal interview results.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The Office
of Finance and Management (OFM) and ISA are
developing a business case for replacement of the
City/County’s financial and human resource
systems. Developing a business case will
encompass three phases – defining the problem,
identifying and researching alternatives, and making
a recommendation for replacement. The project has

the system. Testing by a pilot group will begin once
the system is operational.

Public Safety Camera Surveillance Project: This
project is divided into two separate projects.
Neighborhood Cameras: Meetings between
Koorsen and the NG helpdesk took place to
establish the process for service calls. Koorsen and
NG also met to provide a knowledge transfer of the
current network design. Site surveys are in
progress. Upon sign-off, camera installs can begin.
Liberty Shield/Buffer Zone: Hardware was
received and is being configured for the final camera
install of Phase 2. Once the camera is installed and
working properly, sign-off of Phase 2 can take place.
Phase 3 cameras will not be installed until the
completion and sign-off of the Phase 4 cameras.
Phase 4 cameras are expected to be installed by
March 2008.

Enterprise Vault (E-Vault): During the last week of
November, Symantec, NG and ISA worked together
to successfully implement E-Vault and it is now
operational within ISA/NG/DAI. Roll-out to the
Enterprise will be done in phases over the next few
months to minimize the impact to end users and the
Exchange environment. In parallel with this rollout,
the Outlook archiving engine will be disabled for
each user when automated E-mail archiving is
enabled to ensure that users are fully converted to
E-Vault. Following rollout, E-mail archived prior to
E-Vault implementation (commonly called .psts) will
be added to the enterprise archive to complete the
installation.

Property System Replacement: Initial CAMA Data
Conversion is 100% complete with Property 96%
complete. The converted data looks good, no major
problems, there are 1000 mobile homes and a few
condos left to convert. Liability data (payments, etc.)
will not be converted until the Treasurer module is
ready for complete implementation in the June/July
time frame. County and Township Assessors’
subject matter expert training and testing began on
Monday, November 26 and will continue through
January 18, 2008. PVDNet Load and Stress Testing
has been scheduled for Saturday, December 15th.
The goal of load and stress testing is to determine if:
• Planned hardware is adequate
• Software performs acceptably on hardware
• Network and bandwidth resources are
sufficient

Self Password Reset (myReset): As of December
1, all Active Directory (LAN) passwords have been
expired and are now on a 90 day expiration cycle.
The overall impact to the help desk was minimal and
we did not receive any large call spikes due to the
expiration of the LAN passwords. We currently have
1087 users registered to use the myReset tool and
the Help Desk team is actively authenticating these
users by using the challenge questions. Text
changes to Help Desk resolution response emails
will be implemented by January 1, 2008, to inform
users of the requirement to use myReset for all
future password reset requests. The current plan is
to begin requiring all users to use the myReset tool
to reset passwords effective February 29, 2008.
Storage Assessment: Additional storage has been
ordered and should be delivered and operational
early in January. Work is now focused on
developing a strategy for backing up data.
Virtualization: Virtualization of servers continues
with 65 virtual servers running on 10 physical boxes.
An additional 7 servers have been purchased to
handle the additional capacity needs for all of the
on-going projects and to consolidate existing
servers. Technical resources from VMWare were
on-site the last week of November to assist in
optimizing the environment and will continue to work
with us as more servers are virtualized to ensure a
smooth transition.

Information Technology Board
March 25, 2008 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

ISA Report
Ms. Patel, CIO, ISA presented the ISA report including discussion on the
completion of projects such as the ISA budget questionnaire. The questionnaire
is complete and has been deployed throughout the enterprise to assist in the
development of the annual IT budget for all agencies and departments. Election
Board Incident Reporting System (EBIRS) was the application developed and
used in the November 2007 election to track polling place incidents requiring
assistance from the Marion County Election Board (MCEB) runners and/or field
mechanics. Enhancements were made and completed for the March 11 special
election. Epar is used to track the history of employee’s Personnel Action
Requests that have been submitted during an employee’s tenure at the
City/County. The first draft of the Enterprise Resource Planning Needs Analysis
document has been written and currently undergoing an internal review with final
draft by the end of March. Filenet upgrade is being tested between FileNet P8
and Accela. The spectrum analysis is complete for the municipal wireless
initiative. A determination has been made that will be some interference but not
enough to hinder the project. The Mayor’s Office has been contacted to
recommend external governmental stakeholders to include in the initiative. A
meeting will be held internally to determine the advisory committee. Six of the
neighborhood cameras have been installed. The remaining 14 are expected to
be completed by the end of March or the first of April. An executive session is
scheduled for the Property Replacement System Project to review issues
resulting from the Legislative Session. The Technology Strategic Plan is going
well. Interviews and focus group sessions are expected to be complete by April
4th. Upon completion of the surveys, interviews, and focus group sessions the
results will be compiled and analyzed to assist in determining the direction in
which planning efforts should take. The IT Board and Team will participate in
review. Work continues on the Avaya Modular Messaging System building call
trees. Testing continues with a user group of 25 users with no major problems.
All enterprise email 31 days or older has been migrated to the Enterprise Vault
server. The result will be a reduction in loss of email and pulling requested
information will be easier. A vendor was brought in last month to assist with the
storage assessment and consideration is being given to different strategies and
how to move forward. Virtualization continues with 78 virtual servers running on
14 physical hosts.
Vendor Performance
Ms. Patel reported that the ISA Helpdesk took 5,555 requests for assistance in
February. NG completed 792 regular Install, Moves, Adds and Changes for the
month of February and did not miss any SLAs. DAI met all services levels with
302 application service tickets opened and 181 closed during the month.

Information Technology Board
March 25, 2008 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Ms. White acknowledged DAI Team efforts on the Special Election. Ms. White
stated that the Election Board Incident Reporting application is working great not
only on Election Day but also in helping provide additional information for other
elections.
ISA Financial Report
Mr. Hood, CFO, ISA, presented the February 2008 Financial Report. The report
covers three major areas: expenditures, revenues, and major vendor contract
comparison. Mr. Hood offered that the Miscellaneous Revenue is the close out
of an escrow account from the Microsoft Migration Project and is deemed
investment income. Mr. Hood stated the Agency does not expect any other
miscellaneous revenue this year. Mr. Hood expressed appreciation to those that
have turned in budget questionnaires thus far with the final deadline being April
4th. Mr. Hood took a moment to thank DAI for their work making the
questionnaire more user-friendly this year.
Mr. Reynolds asked if the budget presented reflects the 5% rebate. Mr. Hood
stated the budget does not yet reflect the 95% of the chargeback/pass thru piece,
but will once the plan is finalized. Mr. Reynolds publicly noted ISA is ‘stepping
up’ to look for opportunities to spend less money. Mr. Reynolds offered as
explanation that ISA has developed a plan to only charge customers 95% of the
revenue planned for this year.
Discussion Items
Ms. Horne, Project Manager for the Accela Automation Project and Ms. Brinson,
Business Relationship Manager, ISA presented the Accela Automation Project
Update. Ms. Brinson stated that she has been working with DMD on the Accela
Automation Project. Ms. Brinson continued the update with narration of a
PowerPoint Presentation including an overview of the project.
Ms. Horne continued the update with accomplishments and next steps of the
multiple phases. Ms. Horne followed a PowerPoint Presentation and included
examples of processes that the public would benefit from automating, specifically
in review and issuing of permits.
Ms. Horne offered that in some cities 15 to 20 items are considered for
automation. The enterprise has already identified and implemented hundreds of
items for automation. Ms. Horne stated that the Department of Metropolitan
Development is a big revenue source for the City of Indianapolis. Automated fee
calculation will be available through Accela that will allow for more accurate and
efficient collection. The enterprise already has 30 users trained with a projected
‘go live’ date in October.

Information Technology Board
March 25, 2008 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Mr. Rodman asked for a representation of integration available for the average
citizen. Mr. Rodman commented that currently citizens have to go to multiple
systems for many processes. Ms. Patel responded that the extent of automation
available to the citizens would be determined by what the enterprise wants to
make available. Mr. Rodman suggested discussing at the next IT Board Retreat
or at a later board meeting. Mr. Bowes offered that very discussion would
overlap work done by an Enhanced Access sub-committee on the upcoming RFP
specifically how to provide an internet link to the public, how to configure access,
and which services should have fees associated with them.
The next It Board Meeting is scheduled for April 22, 2008 in Room 260.

returned, put into operation, and functionality
verified, the project will move toward the closing
status.
Accela Automation: The configuration of Accela to
meet Indianapolis-specific requirements continues
with the following progress: configuration is 36%
complete; interfaces are 20% complete; reports
development is 25% complete. Data mapping /
conversion is 23% complete, including an initial data
import from Master Address Database, GIS &
Property system. This is a key capability that will
allow DMD to streamline their daily work.
Orientation training for approximately 40 users was
conducted to better assure they are prepared for
their testing duties. Initial user testing of cases
continues and test script development has started.
Go-live is on-schedule for late October.

Completed Projects
Air Quality Monitoring: The Air Quality Index (AQI)
is monitored by DPW’s Office of Environmental
Services thru various sensors throughout the county.
This compiled data is available via a public website
that was rewritten to incorporate new standards and
minor enhancements.

Criminal/Civil Case Management: ISA was
informed that the Courts have made a decision and
commitment to move forward with Odyssey, the
JTAC statewide case management system. The
Courts also requested cancellation of the
JUSTIS.net project. The Courts will soon begin
discussions with JTAC regarding timeframes and
planning for the Odyssey implementation.

Marion County Superior Courts PC Refresh:
The ISA/NG team completed a three month long
project to refresh computers used by the Marion
County Superior Courts. The effort included
returning 453 leased computers (i.e., CPU, monitor,
keyboard and mouse) to IBM and replacing those
machines with new leased assets from Dell. The
three month project was completed on time, without
any significant upset in court operations, or
additional costs.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The final
draft of the Enterprise Resource Planning Needs
Analysis document has been reviewed by ISA
Management. The first initial report will be delivered
to the Office of Finance and Management for their
review by April 18th. Based on the OFM feedback,
ISA will schedule a presentation of findings.

DocGen – GPS monitoring: DocGen is a desktop
application that provides a means for quickly
generating and printing forms utilizing Microsoft
Word’s mail merge capabilities. Standardized Word
form templates are quickly populated from a
database in the courtroom allowing Judges to print
multipage documents in real time, which improves
the operational efficiencies of the court.

FileNet Upgrade: The interface between FileNet P8
and Accela is in the initial testing phase. A review of
the IndiDocs Gap Analysis with DMD Planning and
Compliance has been completed and confirmed that
a high percentage of functionality would be handled
within FileNet P8. The project team is currently
documenting business requirements so that the
IndiDocs replacement will encompass all business
needs.

On-Going Projects
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): The RFID
project continues to move forward; however, there
are some outstanding issues. There are minor
software bugs and additional training to take place.
The project has changed to yellow status this month
related to an equipment/hardware issue. The
equipment has been sent back to the vendor to be
fixed and has an expected return to the Juvenile
Justice Center on April 17th. Once the equipment is

Municipal Wireless Feasibility Study: In
coordination with the Mayor’s office, ISA has
confirmed six out of eight Advisory Committee
members—more confirmations are anticipated.

Information Technology Board
April 2008 ISA Report Summary
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Planning for the first committee meeting and kickoff
with external stakeholders will be scheduled once all
members are confirmed.

ISA Operational Update
Avaya Modular Messaging: Cut-over to the new
system is scheduled for April 30th. Prior to cut over
ISA will send out a communication plan on what to
anticipate. The remainder of the applications that
need to be moved are in the process of being rerecorded and should be done in the next couple of
weeks. Documentation and communications for the
switch over are being developed.

Public Safety Camera Surveillance Project: This
project is divided into two separate projects.
Neighborhood Cameras: Eighteen of the twenty
Phase 4 cameras have been installed. Phase 4
cameras installed are online and being monitored by
the Emergency Management monitoring room.
Liberty Shield/Buffer Zone: ISA and NG are
investigating cable options for PODS 109 and 111.
EMA and IMPD are investigating relocating the
cameras in the same general vicinity to lower the
costs of construction potentially associated with
cable connectivity at those locations. Once the
issues with PODS 109 and 111 are resolved, Phase
2 will be completed and accepted. Phase 3 camera
installs will begin upon completion of Phase 4.

Enterprise Vault (E-Vault): The old-format e-mail
archives (.pst files), gathered from all locations
accessible to users (local drives, fileservers), have
been successfully imported for 112 out of 142 users
in the pilot group. This pilot is accomplishing its goal
by demonstrating the process and revealing any
operational issues that will be refined prior to
implementation in the enterprise. Outstanding work
consists of right-sizing and scheduling this process
for the remaining e-mail accounts in order to
manage the incremental load to the Enterprise Vault
servers.

Property System Replacement: The integrated
timeline of all Property Tax related projects will be
revised once a decision is reached regarding ’07 pay
08’ tax bills. The PVDNet database will soon be
refreshed which will convert all personal property
summary records added to the legacy system since
12/14/07 and allow the Assessors to complete their
detail update processing. The project team is
working with System Innovators to define the
business and technical requirements for the
Treasurer’s cashiering system, iNovah, which will
interface with PVDNet.

Storage Assessment: The production environment
for the new Oracle Database Management System
(DBMS) infrastructure has been built and the
migration of the Oracle databases to that
environment has begun. The build out of SQL
Server infrastructure is underway and should be
completed by the April 18th with the migration of
SQL Server databases to follow. Research on
backup strategies and other storage related services
is ongoing.

Strategic Plan: Surveys, interviews, and focus
group sessions are wrapping up. The Crowe Chizek
team will begin analyzing the information gathered
during these processes and developing reports to
communicate the results to ISA. Crowe Chizek is
continuing the gathering of documentation and
analyzing that documentation. Next steps include
documenting IT ability to support the identified
business needs and identifying the existing gaps.

Virtualization: Virtualization has reached 100
virtual servers running on 18 physical hosts—an
increase of 22 and 4 over last month. Server
consolidation efforts have been successful with a
total of 33 applications hosted on 27 virtual (formerly
physical) servers. We are currently assessing the
viability of virtualizing the remaining physical servers
within the enterprise, and developing a schedule as
good candidates are identified.

Email Retention Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish an electronic communications policy for all Indianapolis Marion
County Agencies and Departments, and all other organizations under the Information Services Agency
(ISA) scope of services (referred to collectively as “City/County”) that create, use, and manage electronic
communications as part of the transaction of City/County business. These established guidelines will
promote the effective capture, management, and retention of emails and electronic communications.

Scope
This policy applies to all electronic communications equipment and accounts used by City/County agencies
and departments, and all organizations under the ISA scope of services, for all related business uses.

Policy
Definitions
A. Email messages are similar to other forms of communicated messages such as correspondence,
memoranda, and letters. These include non-record (transitory) emails and public-record emails.
B. Non-record or Transitory Electronic Communications are considered to have no administrative, legal,
fiscal, or archival requirements for their retention. Examples of such non-record electronic
communications include the following:
1. Personal correspondence not relating to conducting City/County business such as lunch
invitations, unsolicited advertisements, and spam;
2. Requests of existing publications, which require no administrative action, policy decision, or
special compilation or research, and copies of replies;
3. Office copies of letters of transmittal that do not add any information to that contained in the
originally transmitted material;
4. Copies of quasi-official notices including memoranda and other records that do not serve as the
basis of official actions (i.e., holiday notices, meeting confirmations, etc.).
C. Government Records, according to Indiana Code include any writing, paper, report, study, map,
photograph, card, tape recording, or other material that is created, received, retained, maintained, used
or filed by a public agency and which is generated on paper, paper substitutes, photographic media,
chemically based media, electronically stored data, or any other material, regardless of form or
characteristics.
Examples of emails that may constitute a public record (not confidential) include the following:
1. Policies and directives,
2. Correspondence or memoranda relating to official business (excluding duplicates)

2

Effective Date: 11/24/2015

3. Agendas and minutes of meetings
4. Any document that initiates, authorizes, or completes a business transaction
5. Final reports or recommendations.
In addition, confidential or partially confidential emails are required to be retained as required by the
appropriate retention schedule.
Examples include the following:
1. Declared confidential by state statute,
2. Required to be kept confidential by federal law,
3. Investigatory records of law enforcement,
4. Attorney work product,
5. Personnel file information (except for information that must be disclosed),
6. Intra- or interagency deliberative materials – expression of opinion or speculative in nature and
communicated for purpose of decision making.
7. Covered by an Indiana Court Administrative Rule 9

Responsibility for Retention
The sender of the email is responsible for ensuring proper retention of emails sent within the City/County.
All other copies of internal email are duplicates and may be deleted. However, if an email was sent by an
outside agency, a member of the public or anyone outside the City/County enterprise, the recipient is
responsible for retention.
Each agency/department is responsible for complying with its retention schedule for its electronic records
and for complying with that retention schedule. ISA is not responsible for the long-term retention of these
records.

Method of Retention
Email records that have not met their retention should be saved by one of the following methods:
1. Print the email and store the hard copy in the appropriate file.
2. Move the email out of the email system to either a user’s home director, agency/department shared
drive, or agency/department document management solution.
Each agency/department shall select the method of retention for that agency/department.

Email Attachments
Attachments should be retained or disposed of according to the content of the attachment itself based on its
appropriate retention, not the email which transmits the attachment.

Effective Date: 11/24/2015

Email Archival
Data in the mailbox (including the inbox, sent items, drafts, and deleted items) will be retained by ISA for a
period of four (4) years. The four year retention period will begin from the creation date of the email, and all
mailbox items will be retained in real-time.
After four (4) years, all mailbox items will be permanently purged by ISA and it will be the responsibility of
the user and the agency/department to save any electronic records that require a retention period longer
than four (4) years prior to the email being purged.

Prevention of Loss
To prevent the loss of email after the four (4) year archival period, the user may:
1. Print the email and store the hard copy in the appropriate file.
2. Move the email out of the email system to either a user’s home director, agency/department shared
drive, or agency/department document management solution.

Email Accounts When Employee Leaves Employment
When an employee is no longer employed with the City/County, it is the responsibility of that
agency/department to immediately notify ISA. That user’s mailbox will be maintained for sixty (60) calendar
days. Individual user mailboxes will be purged after sixty (60) calendar days unless that former employee’s
agency/department Head requests an extension in writing, or ISA is notified of items in the email that must
be managed by another user. It is the agency/department’s obligation to ascertain that electronic records
stored by the former employee will be met, and that items are safeguarded before the 60 day purge is
completed.

Personal Storage Table (.pst) files
The use or creation of .pst files is not supported by ISA. Pst files are not part of the email system.

Litigation Proceedings
Regardless of retention requirements, email and all other electronic correspondence pertaining to
threatened or actual legal proceedings must be retained until the litigation is finally concluded. It is the
responsibility of the agency/department involved to notify ISA, in writing, of the need for the hold on the
destruction of electronic communications.

Responding to Public Records Request
It is the responsibility of the agency/department involved to immediately notify ISA, in writing, of a public
records request if ISA’s assistance is required to provide the public records.

Amendments
Indianapolis and Marion County reserve the right to amend or revise the contents of this policy as deemed
suitable. Each employee will be provided with a notice of all amendments and revisions to this policy.

Acceptable Use Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of City/County hardware, software and network
infrastructure, in order to protect these resources from undue harm. Inappropriate use exposes City/County




Protect the investment the City/County has made in their computer systems

Reduce business and legal risk

Scope
This policy applies to the use of information, devices, and network resources to conduct City/County

judgment regarding appropriate use of information, devices, and resources in accordance with policies and
standards, and local laws and regulation.

Policy
General Use and Ownership

City/County information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by
the City/County, the employee or a third party, remains the sole property of the City/County and
may be regarded as public information.



You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of City/County
information, or a device that accesses City/County data.



You may access, use or share City/County information only to the extent it is authorized and
necessary to fulfill your assigned job duties.

Skype for Business Policy
Skype for Business Overview
Microsoft’s Skype for Business may be used enterprise wide as an informal and internal communication
tool. Skype for Business is based on the familiar Skype instant message experience that allows for users to
easily find and connect with co-workers. It is built into Microsoft Office Productivity Suite, so features like
presence and instant messaging are an integrated part of the Office experience.

Policy


Skype for Business’ allows City/County users to locate and identify the presence of another
City/County user, and send instant messages.



Skype for Business is intended for professional communication only. Conversations are stored
indefinitely, and may be accessed in the conversation history folder. Additionally, message history
can be requested by the general public or a supervisor, just as with email due to the Freedom of
Information Act.



While this application is titled “Skype for Business”, this is not “Skype” as used on a personal
device. Audio and video calling, sharing documents, screen sharing, white boarding, as well as
other additional functions are not available at this time. This application is being used for presence
and instant messaging capabilities exclusively.



Each agency, department, or entity within ISA’s scope of services should develop their own policy
on the use of Skype for Business’s picture and status options.

Authorized Approver Policy
Purpose
It is in the best interest of all City/County agencies and departments, and all other entities within the ISA
scope of services that all IT transactions and service requests are handled in a secure and accountable
manner. This is especially true of requests for IT resources that could incur a cost, modifications of access
to agency/department applications or data, or other requests that could be sensitive in nature. It is the policy
of the Information Services Agency (ISA) for an authorized approver to submit a Security Request to initiate
the previously mentioned services.
A Security Request is any request made to ISA by an agency/department to create, modify or delete a user
account, group resource, file, system or device so as to materially (financial, legal or audit requirements) alter an
individual’s ability to access City/County electronic data, services, assets or applications within the domain of ISA’s
responsibility or ability to support. Security requests must be submitted by an authorized approver in writing or by
electronic systems and methods identified in the authorized approver process.
The authorized approver is one who, within a specific agency or department, has authorization to submit
Security Requests, thus accepting decision making responsibility for the data integrity and financial
solvency of his or her agency/department. In adherence to this policy, it is necessary that each agency
formally designate, in writing, all authorized approvers.

Scope
This policy covers all City/County personnel and all organizations that fall within ISA’s scope of services that
would request technology resources.

Policy
General


Authorized approvers can make decisions that impact their agency/department's finances or data
security; therefore they should be personnel who accept decision making responsibility for the data
integrity and financial solvency of his or her agency/department.



An authorized approver can only submit Security Requests on behalf of the agency/department
they represent to include any and all divisions or subdivisions with the agency/department



Each agency/department should have a minimum of two authorized approvers.



It is the responsibility of the agency/department to maintain the Authorized Approver List with
current personnel, eligible to make decisions on behalf of the agency/department. Should an
authorized approver leave the agency/department for any reason, a current authorized approver
should submit the Authorized Approver Form to remove that user.



It is the responsibility of ISA personnel to confirm all Security Requests are submitted by a current
and valid authorized approver on the Authorized Approver List.

2

Effective Date: 11/24/2015

Authorized Approver List Modifications


Modifications to a new or existing authorized approver for an agency/department must be made
through the completion of an authorized approver Form, submitted to the Service Desk through
email or the Service Desk Portal. For more information on the process of modifying the Authorized
Approver List, please contact your Business Services Consultant.



Modifications to an authorized approver must be done with approval from a current authorized
approver or the agency/department Head.



If an agency/department Head must be added to or removed from the Authorized Approver List,
their form should be signed by a current authorized approver in his or her agency/department, or a
member of the ISA Executive Management Team.



If there is no current authorized approver on the Authorized Approver List at the time a modification
needs to be made, the ISA Executive Management Team can sign the Authorized Approver Form
to complete the transaction.

Security Request Submissions
An authorized approver must submit a Security Request through the Request IT Portal or via email for their
agency/department. The following request types are examples of those that require authorized approval:


Request, modify or delete a network account for an employee or resource.



Modifying a user account to include a name change, access to a specific application, or updating
remote desktop access.



Transferring an employee from one agency/department to another (see Account Transfer Process).



Requesting new equipment, software, or any other product or activity that results in a financial
impact on the requestor’s agency/department.



Creating a confidential data request, such as access to an employee’s email account or H: drive.



Adding or deleting a user or group from a shared network drive.



Adding or deleting a user or group from a SharePoint or Indy.gov site, also to include the users
permission levels (i.e. contributor, editor, read only)

Exceptions
ISA Management has the authority to allow exceptions in rare and compelling cases. Customers should
seek exceptions through their Business Services Consultant.

by Mr. David Reynolds, Mr. Tom Creasser, Mr. Mark Renner, Mr. Kerry Forestal
and Ms. Julie Phealon.
IT Board Business
None.
ISA Report
Mr. Glen Baker, CIO, presented the ISA Report. Mr. Baker stated he was happy
to report that they were able to execute several major agreements. First was the
Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, the Northrop Grumman Renewal Agreement
(4yrs) and sign the ERP Agreements with GFOA and Bucher & Christian. We
continue to get excellent support from the Legal Team and OCC led by April
Schultheis as well as our internal team led by Barbara Thompson. We had a
tremendous amount of work to get these contracts behind us.
Mr. Baker also stated they were able to complete three major initiatives since the
last board meeting. The DataBase and Sun Server Migration initiatives with
thanks going to Phil Brummit, Chuck Carufel, Northrop Grumman, DAI, IMPD,
DMD and the MAC. We were also able to complete the pilot implementation for
the Supervisory Special Report, which we will have a demonstration on today.
Mr. Baker stated that they added four new initiatives this month. Nuisance
Property Tracking System that will track those properties, we will also be
rebidding the GIS Services contract and have an RFP out in July and we will
kick-off a project that will build a Wireless Network for the Marion CountySheriff’s Jail. We launched a study of our hosting services which includes the 9th
floor City County Building and the internal facilities like Henry Street and Post
Road and the disaster recovery we have at Sun Guard. We believe we can
improve the processes, save money and improve our service to the City County.
Mr. Creasser asked how the Wireless Network would be funding. Mr. Baker said
it would be funding with grant money for the initial implementation of the service.
Mr. Baker also stated that by late July we should have a number of other
initiatives completed. Accela Phase One, FileNet, thanks to Barb Brinson,
Courts HR and Payroll System, Marion Superior Courts State Voucher (FAMIS)
interface, Regional Center Design Guidelines for DMD and implement the ISA
Portfolio Management Processes which will kick-off our efforts to re-implement
the functional groups in IT Team.

Mr. Baker said that the Vendor Performance for May for both DAI and Northrop
Grumman – all SLR’s were met.
Mr. Creasser asked about the court moving from Otis to a new time keeping
system. Mr. Baker stated as a part of their HR and Payroll implementation they
will be moving off of Otis.
Mr. Creasser asked about an enterprise-wide effort for the future. Mr. Baker said
the ERP study will identify the solution and integration partners to help the entire
city county move in that direction and the courts agreed to come on line if that is
the decision.
ISA Financial Report
Mr. Aaron Hood, CFO, presented the ISA Financial Report, which covers YTD
through May, 2009. Expenses: $43,985,405 was budgeted for 2009,
$15,825,716 was used YTD May 09, which equals 36% used overall. Revenue:
$35,048,053 was budgeted for 2009, $12,500,558 was used YTD May 09, which
accounted for 35.7% collected. Mr. Hood also reported the 2009 budget includes
approximately $7.6 million in prior year purchase orders which are still active and
of that amount nearly $3.5 million has been spent. ISA records revenue in the
year received. This includes payments received from the 4th Qtr 2008 billings.
Approximately $2.4 million in prior year revenue from a grant and fiscal ordinance
could be received this year.
The Service Areas show a total of $5,978,055 spent for YTD May 09 compared
to $5,989,624 for YTD May 08. This made for a -$11,569 variance.
Mr. Forestal asked about the Char 3 budget having $5M more than last year’s
budget and if he anticipates spending that this year. Mr. Hood said that this
amount was accounted for and he expected to get very close to that amount by
year’s end.

Action Items
Resolution 09-10 Contract Extension Accela Project Manager
Mr. Kevin Ortell, Deputy CIO of ISA, and Ms. Barbara Thompson, Contract
Manager of ISA, presented Resolution 09-10 that would extend the agreement
for one year to continue the services of Project Management by Quest.
Ms. White asked if one year would be enough. Mr. Ortell responded that the
estimated go live for Phase II of the project is mid to end of February of next
3

year, and felt a year would be sufficient. Mr. Baker added that he didn’t think this
amount of money would allow us to complete everything, like business licensing,
so it is possible we will return for another extension.
Ms. Ruby called for a vote and Ms. White made a motion to approve Resolution
09-10. The motion was seconded by Ms. Bowes and passed unanimously.

Discussion Items
Proposed WAN Strategy
Mr. Phil Brummit, Manager of Data Center, ISA and Mr. Kevin Ortell, Deputy
CIO, ISA presented the WAN Services Strategy Review presentation. Mr. Ortell
started the presentation by discussing the background. Currently the service
providers are AT&T, Brighthouse and Comcast and a legacy SBC Frame Relay
for 77 remote locations that is coming to the end of life and will need to be moved
off on to a new technology soon. Voice service is currently delivered over
approximately half of the frame relay sites so we use voice over IP. Broadband
and high speed connections are in use at 116 other remote locations like the
parks and fire stations. Sonet Ring Technology is used to provide highly reliable
backbone to our hosting sites which is Post Rd, City County Building and Henry
Street. Mr. Ortell stated the strategic objectives going forward are to replace
Frame Relay technology; find a technology that provides scalability and support
network intensive applications; improve manageability by consolidating on fewer
technologies; formalizing service level requirements; significantly lower overall
costs and improving the ability to track and report costs. Mr. Reynolds asked
about the objective to significantly lower overall costs and asked for more
explanation. Mr. Brummit stated we are currently spending about 1M a year on
these services and we are looking at a cost reduction of about 30%. Mr. Baker
added that they are looking at $35,000/40,000 a month savings. Ms. Phealon
asked if we have looked at WAN Acceleration. Mr. Brummit said they had looked
but it wasn’t a priority and agreed to see if it made sense to do it at the same
time. Ms. White asked how many locations did we have connected to the
network and Mr. Brummit stated approximately 75 Frame Relay and another 18
on the high speed with AT&T, 59 with Brighthouse and 38 with Comcast. Ms.
White also asked if adding new fire stations will affect pricing. Mr. Baker said
they are currently looking at locking in pricing for additional sites in the contract
negotiations.
Mr. Brummit stated that they will continue to use AT&T Opt-E-Man for high
bandwidth sites which are 100mg to 1gig per second and plan to implement
AT&T Opt-E-Man for lower bandwidth sites which are 4mg to 100mg. He
4

continued by saying they will replace the SONET Ring with 2 Gigamon MPLS
circuits which will allow them to achieve service level agreements targeting high
availability.
Mr. Brummit said the next steps will be to complete 60 site surveys by July 2,
present the proposal at the next IT Board Meeting on July 28, execute the
contract and begin the migration by early August with implementation to be
completed by the end of the year.
Ms. White asked what the contract process has been. Mr. Baker stated that an
RFS went out last year and didn’t receive proposals that would lead to the kind of
change they were looking for, so they worked with the current vendor AT&T to
drive new solutions and new technologies and upgraded their service which will
lead to a longer contract of 3 to 4 year range.

Property System Replacement
Mr. Dan Pavey, Project Manager, ISA and Curt Grasso, PVD presented the
Property System Replacement presentation. Mr. Pavey stated that the number
one priority was to get the reconciliation tax bills out which started June 12th.
LoGO went in to production last week and is accessing PVDNet which allowed
us to have enhanced access to allow public to access property information.
Response time issues were resolved by putting into production a replication data
base. Mr. Pavey stated that 105 of 322 (33%) RFP requirements have been
completed and 203 or 289 (70%) PVD HelpDesk tickets have been resolved.
Mr. Reynolds asked why only 33% RFP requirements have been completed
when we are this far along in the project. Mr. Pavey said that was coming up.
Mr. Pavey stated the challenges of this project were the reconciliation tax bill
initiative and it was much more complex than initially thought. LoGO interface
required more effort than planned as did the response time remediation.
Response time remediation was also causing a delay, so the schedule and many
of the project milestones became outdated. Mr. Creasser thanked Mike Darling,
Curt Grasso and Dan Pavey for putting forth so much effort.
Mr. Pavey asked if this answered Mr. Reynolds question and Mr. Reynolds
suggested he rephrase the question. He just thought it odd that you could be
using a system and it has only met 1/3 of the RFP requirements. Mr. Pavey said
some of the pieces are in place and being used but haven’t been signed off on.
Mr. Reynolds suggested that a listing of what the requirements are and which
office is still waiting on them. Mr. Baker stated that its 33% that is signed off on
and I think what you would find out is what we have done putting the core of the

5

system up that while there may be 100 requirements that haven’t been signed off
on but it doesn’t mean there was no progress those requirements. It may take
another 4 hrs, 5 hrs or another 10 hrs to actually complete and check-off that
requirement and sign off on it. Mr. Pavey said that of the 200 requirements left
there are maybe 100 of them have a resolution for it but haven’t had the time to
test or we tested and it needs more tweaking. Mr. Pavey stated that the next
steps are to define remaining requirements in to two categories and develop a
detailed two-phased plan. He said the plan will target completion of all required
functionality in 2009 and completion of remaining contractual requirements in 1st
QTR 2010 and then we will need to have the contract amended to accommodate
the new timelines and approach. Mr. Bowes stated that one of the biggest
components of getting this signed off on is if the user is happy. He continued by
stating that the user still needs time to test, use it while continuing to process the
regular business of the county. We do need to revise our timeline.

Supervisory Special Demo
Mr. Jim Nelson, DAI and Lt. Mark Wood, IMPD presented the Supervisory
Special Demo presentation. Mr. Mark Thornsberry, DAI began the presentation
by stating that when Mr. Baker came on as the CIO he came to him and asked if
there was anything he could do for him and I told him I needed help on getting
Supervisory Special focused so we can finish this project. He and Mr. Renner
did that and it is now completed. Mr. Nelson introduced the team members and
thanked them for being the best. Mr. Nelson gave a brief history that begins in
January 2007 by saying there have been multiple versions of Supervisory
Special released for testing but because of staffing changes and navigation and
flexibility problems with the program it was decided in February of 2009 to totally
redesign the user interface. The current version was released in May of 2009
and a pilot team was trained and the pilot began in June of 2009.
Mr. Nelson stated that the objectives were to improve the reporting process by
making it easy to use with an intuitive user interface, reduce the time required
from creation to approval and finalization of the report, and eliminate duplication
in data entry, increase accuracy and readability of reports. Mr. Nelson said they
also wanted to provide a single repository of all reports that would support search
capabilities to would also provide quick data summary queries. Mr. Nelson
explained a flow chart of the application and approval flow. Mr. Nelson then
signed in the program and did a demonstration of actual data entry which
showed the resulting final report ready for submission for approval. Mr. Renner
thanked everyone involved.

Ms. Ruby stated it might be nice to do a cost benefit, how much time and cost it
used to take versus the cost of the application for a payoff.

Mr. Bowes said he wanted to thank everyone involved, especially Victor Ray, for
helping the offices of the Auditor, Treasury and the Assessors to create a war
room that members from each of those offices answered calls about the property
tax bills. They handled 10,000 calls in a week.
Ms. Ruby adjourned the June 23, 2009 IT Board meeting at 11:13a.m.

July 2009 ISA Report Summary
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

C u r r e n t P r o j e c t S u m m a r y D e s c r i p ti o n s
Accela Automation
Implementation of a land management system.
Accela will replace many legacy systems and institute
automation into several manual processes. Major
project stakeholders include Department of
Metropolitan Development, Office of Code
Enforcement and Marion County Health and Hospital.

ERP Solution, select an implementation provider
(Integrator), and negotiate solutions and
implementation contracts.
File Services Consolidation
The objective of this initiative is to provide a more cost
effective file storage service by consolidating the
number of servers used to provide those services.
The project includes migrating file storage from
Windows based systems to NetApp mass storage in
addition to retiring Windows servers after migration is
complete.

Altiris Service Desk
Altiris Service Desk will replace the current Siebel
incident tracking tool used by ISA and NG. The Altiris
tool will provide a richer toolset with additional features
allowing for expanded usage and closer integration
with the tools currently in use to track IT inventory and
manage desktops. ISA will see a significant cost
savings, increased productivity and an enhancement
in our ability to provide customer service with the
deployment of this product. The project will be broken
into multiple phases with the first phase aimed at
getting all of the NG staff using the tool.

GIS Services Request for Qualification (RFQ)
The GIS Team has long augmented its internal staff
with outside resources to allow additional flexibility and
to provide a wider range of expertise. The contract for
these services was last competed in late 2005 and as
such, a Request for Qualification (RFQ) will be
released to ensure that the City/County is receiving the
best value for its money.

Business Intelligence
Now that ISA has successfully implemented various
tools used for Business Intelligence and completed a
pilot for the Mayor’s office, we can begin to assess and
develop an Enterprise strategy for rollout and use of
these tools. With a strategy in place, ISA can develop
service offerings to meet the Business Intelligence
needs throughout the Enterprise.

ISA/NG Transition
ISA and Northrop Grumman are working together to
identify, plan, and communicate the changes that will
occur due to the contract extension that has been
signed. A couple of items included are the Altiris
Service Desk, moving IT procurement to ISA, and the
changes in how maintenance agreements are
handled.

Courts HR & Payroll
Implementation of Microsoft GP to upgrade the Marion
Superior Courts (MSC) Human Resource and Payroll
systems. Implementation of a Grants module will also
be included in phase two of the project.

Hosting Services Analysis
The initial goals are to reduce the aggregate costs,
increase the efficiency, and to reduce the recovery
time for hosting services. A secondary objective is to
reduce the environmental impact of ISA’s hosting
services and increase collaboration with other public
entities. The three primary areas of focus are: the
z/OS (Mainframe) hosting platform, the Externally
Hosted Infrastructure, and the current disaster
recovery locations.

Document Management Rollout
FileNet has been identified as the Enterprise
document management solution. We are ready to
implement the new version of FileNet document
management as part of the Accela project. We have
also begun development of a strategy that will enable
us to rollout document management service offerings
throughout the Enterprise.

ISA Portfolio Management
This initiative includes implementing processes and
tools that will enable ISA to: 1) maintain a constant
inventory of active and queued ISA initiatives 2)
ensure that ISA priorities are governed by the ISA
Functional Groups and IT Team and 3) ISA priorities

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) – Business
Requirements and Solution Selection
The scope of this initiative is to gather detailed
requirements for an ERP implementation, select an

and departments.

these problem properties and the actions being taken
to address them are stored in a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet on a network drive. This method of
storing and sharing data is proving inadequate for the
needs of the multi-agency team. This project will
result in a web-based method of gathering and
tracking information and activities related to the
properties. The system should allow access by all
team members, including outside counsel.

MAC Citizen Web Portal Feasibility Study
The MAC is interested in rolling out a Citizen Web
Portal for their most critical services. Currently the
MAC uses Oracle Siebel CRM to log service requests.
We are conducting a feasibility study to determine
what it would take to rollout the Web Portal on the
current Oracle Siebel CRM platform.

“Order of Commitment to Community Corrections”
(CO 09-002) generation for Mental Health Court
Develop an application that utilizes the previously
developed “DocGen” framework to collect, edit and
store the data elements necessary to generate the
“Order of Commitment to Community Corrections” (CO
09-002) at the bench in Judge Barbara Collin’s Mental
Health Court (F08).

MCSD Jail Wireless
In anticipation of future time and cost savings
initiatives such as Automated Clock Rounds,
Automated Event Recording, Automated Commissary
Orders, and Electronic Inmate Medical Records, the
MCSD met with ISA in December 2008 to begin a
feasibility study to provide wireless connectivity within
the secured area of the Marion County Main Jail
facility. A Work Order Request (WOR) was prepared
by Northrop Grumman (NG) and has been approved
by all parties authorizing the building of new
infrastructure using grant funding.

Property System Replacement
This initiative is to implement and migrate to a new
PVD property tax system running in a distributed
computing architecture. The scope includes
supporting the Tax Reconciliation initiatives. The
major stakeholders on this project are the Treasurer,
Auditor, and Assessor.

Marion Superior Court (MSC) State Voucher –
FAMIS Interface
The scope of this project is to enhance the State
Voucher system to capture the required data and
transfer it to FAMIS so that a check can be generated
without manual intervention.

Regional Center Design Guidelines
In order to undertake development in the Indianapolis
Regional Center potential developers must submit a
design plan to DMD Planning for ‘Regional Center
Approval’. The current guidelines for issuing ‘Regional
Center Approvals’ and the review process are
somewhat “fluid” and subject to administrative
interpretation. This resulted in a DMD Planning
initiative to establish and document formal Indianapolis
Regional Center Design Guidelines. The new
guidelines were formally approved by the Metropolitan
Development Commission (MDC) on June 18, 2008.
The implementation of the new guidelines has
prompted the development community to request a
solution that automatically generates the applicable
Regional Center Design Guidelines for each proposed
project. DMD Planning believes that such a solution
will be vital to facilitating future development in the
Regional Center.

MOSS 2007 – Enterprise Rollout
This project involves migrating the existing Content
Management Intranet sites to the MOSS 2007
environment, converting existing SharePoint 2003
sites to MOSS 2007, migrating the MOSS 2007 pilot
Intranet sites and rolling out SharePoint to the
remaining departments.
Municipal Wireless Feasibility Study
The current scope of this project is to determine the
feasibility of utilizing certain applications and business
processes over a municipal wireless network. It is
expected that a pilot will be the end result of the
current scope.
Nuisance Property Tracking System
Attacking vacant and abandoned housing and related
public safety issues is one of Mayor Ballard’s priorities.
IMPD, DMD, and OCC collaboratively developed a list
of the top 25 problematic properties and an action plan
to address each one. Currently information regarding

Wide Area Network (WAN) Services Migration

Project Highlights

card users and were released in conjunction
with the Property Tax Payment Application.

• A new contract was signed on June 30,
2009 for a five year term to provide
enhanced access services to the City of
Indianapolis and Marion County.

•

Marketing Highlights

•

LoGO worked with IMPD to determine if
posters would be beneficial in each
command center to highlight the online
Limited Criminal History and Incident
Report Service. Designs for the new
posters with tear-offs are being created
and should be delivered to each center in
August.

•

LoGO delivered a draft press release to
the Marion County Treasurer’s Office
highlighting the cost savings to citizens for
paying online with the new services,
versus the existing service offered through
another outside vendor.

In the second quarter, over $3.2 million
dollars was collected on behalf of our
City/County partners. Traffic ticket fees
accounted for 61% of this total.

• LoGO Indiana deposited $31,788.42 from
Portal profits into EARC Revenue Share
account during the second quarter.

•

Portal transactions were up from the first
quarter by 5%, but down from the second
quarter of 2008 by 11%. The criminal
case name search service accounts for
the majority of the decline in transactions.
It has been determined this service is
down due to a decrease in the number of
employees being hired.

Development Highlights

Customer Service Highlights

•

• In quarter two, a new service was
released for the Marion County
Treasurer’s Office for online property tax
payments.
• The LoGO development team also
deployed three rewritten services for the
Marion County Auditor, Treasurer and
Assessor for Property Information, Parcel
and Owner History Reports during the
second quarter. These services are
available to both subscribers and credit

AT&T Services
Executive Summary
P urpos e

The purpose of this proposal is to update our Master Services Agreement with AT&T so we can move
forward with our plans to migrate the portion of our Wide Area Network (WAN) services that rely on
their SBC Frame Relay solution which has reached its end-of-life cycle. ISA would seek to transition
to AT&T’s up-to-date and supported technologies. AT&T is one of our primary business partners that
we use in delivering our WAN services to our customers.
B us ines s Objec tives

In addition to moving to a supported solution the following were the primary business objectives of
this initiative:
•
•
•
•

Lowering the cost of services
Formalizing service level requirements
Improving the scalability of the services
Improving the ability to track and report costs by customer and service offering

R es ults

By building upon an existing partnership and working together AT&T and the Information Services
Agency (ISA) were able to agree upon on a solution that:
•

RESOLUTION # 09-13
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BOARD

Executive Summary
Boards and Commissions Application Funding
Introduction
Local Government Online, Indiana (LoGO) has presented a proposal to create a Boards
and Commissions application for the Mayor’s Office and City County Council. This
application will have internal and external components and will present information to
the public at no cost. Funding for the application will come from the Enhanced Access
Fund and has been approved by the Enhanced Access Review Committee (EARC)
Approach
The Mayor’s Office and City County Council utilize an MS-Access based application for
tracking members of 111 Boards and Commissions. This application is inadequate to the
needs of these groups. The State of Indiana has a Boards and Commissions application
created by Access Indiana, a sister company to LoGO. LoGO was approached to modify
this application for the use by the City/County.
LoGO worked with the Mayor’s Office and Council staff to identify their needs and
developed a proposal to meet those needs. Their proposal includes taking the code base
of the State’s application and modifying it to meet the needs of the City/County. The Notto-Exceed cost to do the development work contained in the proposal is $26,641. The
proposal also has on-going hosting costs of $400/month. As the proposed solution will
not include any convenience fees to cover the cost of development and hosting, LoGO
proposed the work as a time and materials project as provided for in their contract.
The Mayor’s Office and City County Council approached the Enhanced Access Review
Committee to seek funding for this through the EARC. The EARC unanimously
approved authorizing up to $28,000 from the Enhanced Access Fund to cover the
development costs and the expected 3 months of hosting for 2009. The EARC asked the
Mayor’s Office and Council to return to seek funding for 2010 hosting later this year.
Conclusion
The EARC recommends that the IT Board authorize the expenditure of up to $28,000 to
cover the development and 2009 hosting costs of a new Boards and Commissions
application for the Mayor’s Office and City County Council to be developed and hosted
by LoGO.

Leading the way in Strategic Enterprise-wide Technology

Guiding Principles
1.

The ERP Initiative is a “Government” process improvement project which is
supported by technology. It is not a technology project.

2.

Each agency and department must take ownership for engaging unselfishly in
the success of the project to maximize enterprise-wide improvement.

3.

The consolidation of accounting/financial functions is key to the success of the
ERP system. The implementation must result in an integrated financial system
that coordinates the financial activities of all of city/county government.

4.

The ERP system of choice will be consistent with strategic plans of the
government, providing the benefits expected by the stakeholders.

5.

Our primary goal is to select and implement a robust ERP product which can be
timely implemented within all outlined constraints, and which provides the
government with data systems which are continually viable as technology
advances.

Approval of the November 28, 2007 IT Board Meeting Minutes
Dr. Inui, Mayoral Appointee, made a motion to approve the November 28, 2007
IT Board Minutes. The motion was seconded by Judge Collins, Marion County
Superior Court, and carried unanimously.
ISA Report
Ms. Patel, CIO, ISA presented the ISA report including the Criminal/Civil Case
Management System. ISA has identified additional users to bring in for User
Acceptance Testing and scripting sessions based upon the report analysis. The
team is still gathering information and working with the user community. The
Accela project has moved to yellow due to delays with deliverable finalization and
acceptance, finalization of interface roles and responsibilities, DMD/Compliance
move and holiday vacations/benefit leave. The Office of Finance and
Management and ISA are building a business case for replacement of the City
and County’s financial and human resource systems. Phase 1 of the project is
complete with gathering high level business requirements from the Office of
Finance and Management, Purchasing, the Auditor’s Office, the Marion County
Clerk, IMPD, the Marion County Treasurer’s Office and the Department of Public
Works. Staff is gathering market research and will provide summaries for
agencies and the Board by February. The Municipal Wireless Feasibility Study
continues to move forward. Public Safety Camera Surveillance Project is divided
into two separate projects, the Neighborhood Cameras and the Liberty
Shield/Buffer Zone project. The Avaya modular messaging project includes
replacement of the current voice mail system. Equipment for the system has
arrived and is in the process of being installed. E-vault has been deployed to
DAI, ISA, and NG. ISA is working on a communication plan prior to roll out to the
enterprise. As of December 1, all Active Directory passwords have been expired
and are now on a 90 day expiration cycle. The current plan is to begin requiring
all users to use the myReset tool to reset passwords effective February 29, 2008.
Operations
Ms. Patel reported that both DAI and NG met all service levels and there are
currently 3 applications going through user acceptance testing.
ISA Financial Report
Mr. Hood, CFO, ISA presented the monthly financials beginning with the
expenses relative to what has been spent year-to-date. Mr. Hood reported on
2007 November year-to-date revenue and contract comparison 2006 to 2007.
Mr. Hood reported that the ISA fiscal ordinance was passed at the full council
meeting on December 17.

Property System Update
Mr. Buels, Lead Project Manager, ISA and Mr. Pavey, Project Manager, ISA, and
Mr. Grasso, Project Manager, PVD presented the update on the Property Tax
System Replacement Project. Mr. Buels commented that the Property Project
Team of ISA, PVD and DAI were working well together. Mr. Buels expressed
thanks to elected officials and appointed agency heads for lending resources
needed to aid in the success and competition of the project.
Mr. Bowes, Marion County Assessor, stated that the old system is broken into
two individual systems the CAMA (Computer Aided Mass Appraisal) and a record
keeping system that contains the end result assessment data. The systems are
two separate systems and use the measurements as the basis for the
assessment utilizing a detailed chart to determining the price of replacement for
items such as drywall or two by fours. The new system will integrate the two
components and translate the measurements into an assessment.
Mr. Pavey commented that Ms. Roembke, Business Relationship Manager for
ISA, has a done a great job gathering and cataloguing reports. The reports
include daily, monthly, and end of cycle reports generated by the mainframe
legacy system and Access-based reports totaling in the 100’s generated within
the Assessor, Auditor and Treasurer offices. PVD subject matter experts are
analyzing the reports and will then meet with the users to determine which
reports can be consolidated and which can be eliminated.
Mr. Bowes stated that he has been participating in training on two or three
modules which are working pretty well. Mr. Bowes stated that Mr. Pavey and
PVD have put together a very good testing solution. Testers are being asked to
learn the system, test thoroughly and report on each transaction. Mr. Bowes
stated that the system is good for electronically sending feedback. The vendor is
offering a good tool to make sure the system works prior to going on line. Mr.
Bowes’s concern was that the strength of the tool is dependent on the testers.
Mr. Bowes encouraged designated staff to use the tool to ensure PVDNet works
before being put into operation. Ms. Enders asked if measures were being taken
to ensure hard testing is going on in other areas and if the number of tests were
being logged. Mr. Pavey confirmed that a 55-page test script is being used to go
through residential testing and test results are being logged. Mr. Bowes stated
that the challenge is for staff to continue operating in addition to participating in
the testing. The priority to spend time to get testing done is needed to be certain
the enterprise has a good product.

Information Technology Board

Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Ms. Patel added that best practices are being followed, but as with all major
implementations, some bugs may be missed. Staff will maintain a list of
enhancements to PVDNet that may be requested in the future. Mr. Bowes
stated again that the testing tool is well designed and encouraged participants to
test like mad. Mr. Rodman stated that the concerns were well founded.
Mr. Grasso, PVD stated that developers are involved in the data conversation
process, know the data well, and are checking the legacy system against the
PVD system to ensure data is correct and in the right place. A short list of issues
has been identified. The data will be reconverted and populated. Mr. Grasso
stated that overall the data conversion is going well.
Dr. Inui asked if milestones are anchored at specific dates or deadlines which
cannot slide preventing the project from hitting a target date. Mr. Rodman stated
that the key is flexibility and added Mr. Pavey and peers have been very helpful
and will be flexible enough to work with any date certain. Dr. Inui asked if there
currently were dates to drive the project so that the infrastructure is ready.
Mr. Bowes discussed the concern with vague goals as part of the challenge with
a complicated reassessment and relying on people outside of the enterprise’s
control to meet deadlines. Mr. Bowes continued that the project team is certain
to hold the project accountable and is constantly setting and reviewing milestone
dates. Mr. Bowes added that across the board there is agreement that no one
can use the legacy system for ’07 pay’08 and that is a driving motivation to get
things done.
Mr. Pavey took the opportunity to thank elected and appointed officials, the
project team area coordinators and subject matter experts for their cooperation
and commitment which has been incredible.
Dr. Inui suggested looking prospectively at new developments for commitment
for user acceptance testing upfront from the user communities. User Acceptance
Testing takes real work. A good design is only half the effort, testing,
modification and fixing what emerges after that is equally as taxing. Mr. Pavey
commented on the team’s commitment. The executive team which is driven by
elected and appointed officials has been excellent and meets every other month.
The project team which meets every other week attendance has been 90
percent. The participants are excited about the project and are looking forward
to testing Marion County data which will be more meaningful. The existing
system is difficult to use.

Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Mr. Morgan DPW, Public Safety, asked about the interfaces with initiatives such
as Accela. Mr. Pavey explained that PVDnet and other initiatives will share
information but not work files. Mr. Morgan asked what drives the need for state
and local parcel numbers. Mr. Pavey explained that the state requirement is a 21
digit number. Ms. Patel stated that the mandate may have been as early as
1990 and is extremely expensive to convert in mainframe; however, with .Net the
enterprise will continue to keep old parcel numbers for historical information.
Potentially the numbers could be linked. Dr. Inui suggested that eventually GIS
data will be used to identify parcels.
IT Business
Mr. Rodman commented that the only constant is change with serving on the
Board close to two years, ISA has had three directors. Mr. Rodman commented
on periods of low staff moral and the positive impact the agency has experienced
under Ms. Patel as CIO. She has achieved stability and moral has risen to the
pleasure of the board. Mr. Rodman expressed the desire to maintain that
stability even through the upcoming change with the Mayor and Council. Mr.
Rodman explained he has had recent conversations with the transition team and
the suggestion has been offered for the Board to exercise their right to offer Ms.
Patel a one year contract. The salary would remain the same with a 90-day,
notice-given provision and the potential to review and adjust the current salary
the first quarter of next year.
Mr. Meadows made a motion to have a contract drawn with the outlined
provisions. The motion was seconded by Ms. White and passed unanimously.
Resolution 07-21 to Recognize Robert J. Clifford for his service to the
Information Technology Board
Mr. Rodman presented Resolution 07-21.
Mr. Clifford expressed appreciation for the opportunity to be a member of Board
and work with Board members. He wished the Board, staff and Ms. Patel luck
with continued forward motion.
The next It Board Meeting is January 22, 2008 in Room 118.
The December 18, 2007 IT Board Meeting adjourned at 10:47.

January 2008 ISA Report Summary
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

•

Finalization of interface roles &
responsibilities
• DMD / Compliance move & holiday
vacations/benefit leave
• Delays in required Accela functionality
• Underestimation of configuration
requirements
The team reevaluated the Project Schedule / dates
and have communicated the updated timelines to
the customer.

Completed Projects
DPW/DMD Sherman Move: ISA provided data,
voice and technical assistance for the move from
604 N. Sherman to 1200 Madison in December. The
project consisted of three areas: 1) fiber ring
extension from the City/County building to Madison
2) telephone network wiring and wireless 3)
assistance with configuration and set up of printers
and computers.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The Office
of Finance and Management (OFM) and ISA are
developing a business case for replacement of the
City/County’s financial and human resource
systems. Developing a business case will
encompass three phases – defining the problem,
identifying and researching alternatives, and making
a recommendation for replacement. The project has
completed Phase 1 of gathering high level business
requirements from OFM, Purchasing, Office of the
Auditor, MC Clerk, IMPD, MC Treasurer, and DPW.
Currently, the project is in Phase 2 where ISA has
completed gathering market research information
and best practices on available ERP software
options. An initial draft of the ERP Needs Analysis
will be presented the beginning of February 08
highlighting the current state of the City/County
systems and research comparisons on ERP
solutions available in the market today.

MBE/WBE Vendor Directory: This Application
provides a public online directory of DPW MBE/WBE
certified vendors. The application’s primary function
is to provide DPW and vendors with an easy to use,
readily accessible means of identifying and locating
MBE/WBE certified subcontractors. Vendors can
also access the application to submit their profile
and search for MBE/WBE certified vendors.

On-Going Projects
Criminal/Civil Case Management: The Marion
Superior Court filed an Executive Order on
December 21, 2007, indicating their commitment to
move forward with the Indiana Supreme Court and
the Judicial Technology and Automation Committee
with the implementation of the Odyssey Court Case
Management System. In addition, the Executive
Order requested that ISA provide an indication as to
whether the JUSTIS.net project can be completed by
August 31, 2008. ISA delivered the response to that
Order including a timeline of the remaining
JUSTIS.net tasks on January 14th.

FileNet Upgrade: The FileNet P8 software is
scheduled to be installed and configured on ISA/ NG
servers by IBM FileNet resources starting January
th
th
14 , and be operational by January 25 . The optical
platters are presently in the hands of Prescient and
in the process of being converted. The IndiDocs
Gap Analysis is also in progress, with information
being obtained from FileNet users to assure the
availability of stored documents will be retained after
the FileNet P8 implementation, Upon completion,
scheduled for mid-February, the IndiDocs Gap
Analysis will indicate whether development of an
additional IndiDocs replacement software package is
necessary to act as a document revision agent, in
addition to the new FileNet P8 software capabilities.

Accela Automation: Analysis is 100% complete.
The configuration phase (updates to Accela to meet
Indy requirements) is 20% complete. Interfaces are
4% complete. Efforts for reports development are
10% complete (total reports effort). Data mapping /
conversion is 10% complete. The project is yellow
for the following reasons:
• Delays with deliverable finalization &
acceptance

Municipal Wireless Feasibility Study: Interviews
with the initially targeted eight (8) governmental
agencies are complete. We will be working with field

applications interactions of current wireless
offerings. ISA is awaiting delivery of findings from
initial interviews and market analysis is currently
underway. Stakeholder feedback continues to be
both positive and supportive.

system is fully operational and tested, a cut-over
date will be scheduled.
Election Transition: With the change in
Administration, ISA provided IT support beginning
January 1, 2008, to assist staff in getting access to
the City-County network. Support included a refresh
of machines, submitting and processing of security
request, phone and Blackberry set-up, website
rd
modifications, 3 -party application report generation
and general on-site support. As the Mayor’s Office
staff continues grow over the coming months, ISA
will provide support, as needed.

Public Safety Camera Surveillance Project: This
project is divided into two separate projects.
Neighborhood Cameras: Site surveys were
complete and approved. A test at the CSX location
is being conducted and appears to be going well.
Upon success, the neighborhood camera installs
can begin and will utilize cable connectivity versus
radios.
Liberty Shield/Buffer Zone: The CSX test is now
being conducted. Upon successful acceptance, the
camera will be operational and sign-off on Phase 2
can take place. Phase 3 cameras will not be
installed until the completion and sign-off of the
Phase 4 cameras. Phase 4 cameras are expected
to be installed by March 2008.

Enterprise Vault (E-Vault): Following the
successful deployment within ISA, DAI and NG, EVault was also rolled out to a broader group of test
users situated in numerous departments. With the
two successful pilots now completed, the Enterprise
implementation will start in mid-January with a
completion date of the end of February. A
communication plan has been created and we will
be sending out information to the enterprise before
we proceed. In parallel with this rollout, the Outlook
archiving engine will be disabled for each user when
automated E-mail archiving is enabled to ensure that
users are fully converted to E-Vault. Once the
Enterprise rollout is complete, e-mail archived prior
to E-Vault implementation (commonly called .psts)
will be added to the enterprise archive vault to
complete the project.

Property System Replacement: This project
continues to move forward on schedule. Personal
property detail functionality was implemented
12/24/07. Assessor SME’s will be entering
‘07Pay’08 data as production testing. As of 1/2, 35
users have been given sign-on and password
capabilities. 1,000 personal property records have
been successfully entered. Reassessment project
tasks and ‘07pay’08 tax bills project tasks will be
included in the revised PVDNet project plan to show
interdependencies among the three projects. The
second round of Load and Stress Testing is
scheduled for Saturday, January 12.

Self-Password Reset (myReset): As of January 1,
all Active Directory (LAN) passwords have been
expired and are now on a 90-day expiration cycle.
During the month of December, the help desk
fielded 835 password reset requests. The overall
impact to the help desk has been minimal and we
did not receive any large call spikes due to the
expiration of the LAN passwords. Since our last
update and additional 186 users have registered
with myReset, bringing the total number of users of
the tool to 1273. Text changes to Help Desk
resolution response emails were implemented to
inform users of the requirement to use myReset for
all future password reset requests. The current plan
is to begin requiring all users to use the myReset
tool effective February 29, 2008.

ISA Operational Update
Avaya Modular Messaging: The equipment has
arrived and been installed. Avaya is in the process
of configuring the system and rollout to a pilot test
group will begin once the system is ready. Once the

Storage Assessment: The additional storage
capacity ordered in December to meet the

installed, configured and placed into production in
early February. Work is now focused on developing
a strategy for capacity planning processes and
backup solutions for the storage infrastructure.

Virtualization: Virtualization of servers continues
with 68 virtual servers running on 11 physical
boxes. The new production environment is being
installed and configured. Upon completion of the
environment, the consolidation of existing servers
into the virtual server farm will commence. This
process is expected to continue throughout most of
2008.

Board.

ISA Report
Good Morning Madam Chair and Good Morning Board Members!
We have completed 2 projects and moved 3 projects to Yellow status for schedule during
the last month while all remaining projects are on schedule and budget.
Completed:
 2015 Chargeback Redesign: The 2015 Chargeback Model Redesign project
was completed in July. This project redesigned the IT and Telecom
chargebacks to be consumption based, providing more transparency to ISA
customers. The new model moves away from the previous annualized
chargeback and instead allows ISA to charge customers based on actual
usage of resources such as data used or licenses assigned to the customer.
This empowers ISA customers to control IT and telecom costs thereby
helping ISA control the City-County IT and telecom budgets. Overall, the
changes to the chargebacks have been well received by customers.
 False Alarm Tracking & Reporting System: This new application replaces
the legacy IMPD application to track, monitor and report on false alarm runs
for Police. The new application also allows for IFD to track and monitor their
false alarm runs as well. Accurate tracking and reporting on these runs
could result in significant revenue for the respective departments.
o Yellow Status
 ERP Implementation, Financials Phase 2 – Accounts Receivable/iNovah
expansion: This final component of the PeopleSoft system was set to go
live at the end of June. With the movement of the PeopleSoft system back
to the CCB and other business priorities, our customers requested a delayed
start to testing and implementation. Testing is now underway and it is
expected to have this module implemented by the end of October, 2014.
 PC Fresh 2013: We have talked about the challenges with this project over
the course of the last few months. We are nearing the end of the 2012/2013
PC Refresh with Sondhi Solutions. Given the current schedule, they will
have completed this work by the end of August, 2014 with the exception of a
few agencies/departments. There are 2 (Coroner and MAC) that cannot
move to Windows 7 due to mission critical legacy applications. We are
working with these agencies on replacement solutions. The other agency
that will not be complete by the end of August is the Department of Public
Safety, specifically IMPD. We are in final testing with regard to their legacy
applications and plan to begin their migration this fall. We have been able to
migrate Homeland Security and Animal Care & Control. We are in the early
stages of creating an image and testing with IFD. We have also made great

progress thus far in refreshing the 2014 devices in our environment as well.
This has been a challenging project and at times very frustrating for our
customers so I’d like to thank our customer base for their patience and
understanding as we continue to work through the issues as quickly as is
possible.
Mobile Device Management Pilot: ISA has implemented a proof of concept
platform that will allow us to better manage mobile devices in our
environment. Given competing priorities, it took longer than anticipated to
get the new platform implemented. We are in the process of testing the new
platform and application within ISA. We anticipate asking customers to
participate in this pilot so that we have a good basis of feedback prior to
making final decisions with regard to permanent implementation.

Additional Updates:
o Exchange 365: ISA in partnership with Microsoft will upgrade the City’s current
Microsoft Exchange Email System to the Microsoft 365 Exchange in the cloud. This
first phase will only include the new email client on each user’s desktop, and doesn’t
include the Office 365 Suite at this time. The Microsoft 365 Exchange platform will
provide many new benefits to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County users. The first
of which is 50G of storage per mailbox, which is a substantial increase. An
additional benefit would be the provision of Lync instant messaging which allows
each user to communicate with virtually every user, department, team, and group in
the organization in real-time. Preparations to upgrade our exchange system, is
currently underway and we expect the first pilot migrations (ISA) of enterprise
mailboxes to begin soon. We, however, have some cleanup work to complete prior
to these migrations. All desktops in the enterprise must have office 2010, and
internet browsers must be upgraded to the latest versions to allow full functional use
of the 365 email solution. Further communication with regard to the rollout of the
upgraded MS Office and internet browser levels is forthcoming in the near future.
We are excited about the benefits of the upgrade and look forward to bringing the
best technologies to the City of Indianapolis/Marion County.

October 2014 ISA Project Summary Report

Current Project Summary Descriptions
CCB Bandwidth Increase
ISA will be upgrading the bandwidth infrastructure for
the City County Building. This upgrade will provide a
better user experience for all agencies/departments
utilizing the network in the building and will provide ISA
with the ability to meet demand for years to come.

Mainframe Applications and Data Retirement
This project will retire the use of the Main Frame and
all applications and data currently residing on it. All
applications previously used on the manin frame have
now been replaced by new applications using current
tecfhnologies. The relevant data being used by these
new replacement applications has also been moved to
the respective database platforms. All applications
and data will be backed up for historical purposes.

DPW Traffic Signal Network and System Upgrade
ISA will assist DPW Engineering’s upgrade of the
traffic signal network and signal management system.
The project has three major components: network
devices at intersections and in the ISA data center,
fiber optic cable under City streets, and traffic signal
monitoring software. The network will be supported by
DPW and ISA. The estimated project completion date
has been revised to December 2014.

Marion County Property Card Assessor’s Portal
This project will add the Property Card containing
Marion County property assessed values to existing
“GIS – Public facing application” which currently
provides other parcel property information.
Mobile Device Management (MobileIron) Pilot
ISA is working to execute a mobile device
management platform pilot using an application called
MobileIron in the environment. This application will
enable ISA with a toolset to manage wireless devices
with better efficiency as well as enhancing the user
experience. The first application pilot has completed.

Electronic Subpoena
The project will provide an electronic method for Law
Enforcement Officers to obtain their subpoena
information. The current process is to extract
subpoena information, print onto postcards and mail to
law enforcement officer. Many times cards were not
received. The new application is a more convenient
and efficient way for law enforcement officers to track
their subpoenas.

Outlook 365 Upgrade
ISA will be upgrading the Exchange system to a more
current release. This new release will offer us new
functionality and flexibility that currently does not exist
in our environment today.

Enterprise WiFi (Private & Public)
ISA is conducting an assessment to bring an
enterprise class private and public WiFi solution into
the City County Building (and potentially campus
locations). After completion of the assessment and
determination of final solution, we will begin
communication to the enterprise as well as
implementation of the solution.

PC Refresh 2012, 2013 & 2014
ISA is committed to refreshing the City/County
technology on a consistent basis to ensure our
customers are provided with the technology that will
allow them the greatest opportunities to do their work
in a speedy and cost effective manner. This project is
to upgrade our end-user devices to keep current with
new technologies. The refresh for 2013 will
encompass the devices that were not refreshed in
2012 and the majority of the devices that are due in
2013.

ERP Implementation – Multiple Phases
We are implementing the final phase of the 3-year
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project.
Accounts Receivable will be the last module
implemented into PeopleSoft. This module includes an
interface for Cash Management

October 2014 ISA Project Summary Report
Siebel to Salesforce Migration
ISA will be replacing the MAC’s current Call Center
application (Siebel), with a new platform, and
application, Salesforce.com. This will replace the aged
and underutilized Siebel system, with a more robust
and agile application better fitting the needs of The
MAC. Salesforce.com platform will allow faster
development of future application requests by other
departments as well.

Voter Information Portal Enhancements
This project will provide updates to the VIP as
requested by the customer. Enhancements have been
requested to both the public-facing application as well
as the internal data maintenance application.
Windows 7 & Office 2010 Migration
ISA is committed to refreshing the City/County
technology on a consistent basis to ensure our
customers are provided with the technology that will
allow them the greatest opportunities to do their work
in a speedy and cost effective manner. This project
will upgrade our current desktop environment to
include Windows 7 for the operating system, Office
2010 for the office suite and Internet Explorer 10 for
the web browser. Over the last year, ISA has been
working directly with Microsoft to evaluate best
practices and standards for this migration as well as
create an implementation plan.

Tablet Pilot
ISA will be conducting a tablet pilot with multiple
agencies/departments within the enterprise to see if
tablets are a viable device for mobile and/or field
employees. This pilot will be conducted over
approximately 120 days with consistent monitoring and
feedback from the pilot users. At the end of the pilot,
ISA will provide the pilot findings along with any
established guidelines and/or policies, if needed, for
continued use of tablets in the enterprise.

LoGO Indiana: During Quarter Three, 138,416
transactions were processed through the Indygov.Biz
Portal. The transactions processed resulted in over
$3.6 million deposited back to City/County Agencies in
statutory fees. The revenue generated by Incident
Reports declined by 48% for Quarter Three compared
to the same time last year. This is due to Incident
Reports being moved to a new CAD system database
and the inability of LoGO to access district records at
this time. Civil Court Records continue to show a
decline for the third quarter. Overall Civil and Criminal

  HIGHLIGHTS	
  
	
  
Due	
  to	
  the	
  contractual	
  changes	
  beginning	
  in	
  
July	
  2014,	
  the	
  LoGO	
  Team	
  has	
  been	
  making	
  
budgetary	
  adjustments	
  and	
  transitioning	
  team	
  
members	
  to	
  other	
  Portals	
  as	
  open	
  positions	
  
became	
  available.	
  	
  
	
  
During	
  the	
  month	
  of	
  July,	
  the	
  LoGO	
  Indiana	
  
Team	
  completed	
  integration	
  of

  on	
  
the	
  Property

  Applications	
  for	
  the	
  Marion

  Assessor’s	
  Office.	
  	
  	
  
	
  
Due	
  to	
  migration	
  of

  CAD	
  Systems,	
  
the	
  Probation	
  Payment	
  Application	
  and	
  Limited

  were	
  
decommissioned	
  in	
  July.	
  
	
  
During	
  the	
  months	
  of	
  August	
  and	
  September,	
  
the	
  LoGO	
  Indiana	
  Team	
  worked	
  with

During	
  the	
  month	
  of	
  September,	
  the	
  LoGO	
  
Indiana	
  Team	
  prepared	
  notices	
  to	
  send	
  to	
  
IndyBiz	
  subscribers	
  regarding	
  the	
  transition	
  of	
  
Court	
  Records	
  to	
  Odyssey,	
  and	
  the	
  retirement	
  
of	
  the

  Notices	
  were	
  also	
  placed	
  
on	
  all	
  Court	
  Applications	
  detailing	
  the	
  upcoming	
  
changes	
  to

The	
  LoGO	
  Indiana	
  Admin	
  Team	
  worked	
  with	
  the	
  
Greater	
  Indianapolis	
  Progress	
  Committee	
  to	
  set	
  
up	
  an	
  online	
  public	
  facing	
  application	
  to	
  allow	
  
citizens	
  to	
  purchase	
  and	
  register	
  for	
  the	
  2015	
  

Mayor’s	
  Celebration	
  of	
  Diversity	
  Awards.	
  	
  A	
  
similar	
  application	
  will	
  be	
  set	
  up	
  to	
  accept	
  
payments	
  and	
  registration	
  for	
  the	
  Whistler	
  
Awards	
  in	
  October.	
  
	
  
During	
  Quarter	
  Three,	
  the	
  LoGO	
  Development	
  
Team	
  completed	
  updates	
  to	
  the	
  LoGO	
  
Customer	
  Database	
  (CDB)	
  by	
  migrating	
  CDB	
  to	
  
Apache	
  CXF	
  Framework	
  to	
  increase	
  application	
  
authentication	
  security	
  and	
  uptime.	
  These	
  
updates	
  will	
  allow	
  CDB	
  to	
  seamlessly	
  failover	
  to	
  
our	
  servers	
  in	
  Allen	
  from	
  Ashburn.	
  
	
  
The	
  LoGO	
  Indiana	
  Development	
  Team	
  worked	
  
with	
  the	
  CDC	
  to	
  perform	
  security	
  server	
  
patching	
  to	
  protect	
  our	
  server	
  and	
  applications	
  
against	
  the	
  Bash	
  Code	
  Injection	
  Vulnerability	
  
CVE-­‐2014-­‐6271.	
  Server	
  patching	
  was	
  applied	
  to	
  
all	
  UNIX	
  servers	
  to	
  safeguard	
  LoGO	
  Indiana’s	
  
UNIX	
  servers	
  from	
  exposure	
  to	
  the	
  potential	
  
effects	
  of	
  the

  including,	
  but	
  not	
  
limited	
  to:	
  remote	
  execution	
  of	
  arbitrary	
  
commands	
  by	
  malicious	
  server,	
  creation	
  of	
  
Botnets,	
  and	
  other	
  shell	
  related	
  remote	
  
command	
  activities.	
  
	
  
The	
  LoGO	
  Indiana	
  Development	
  Team	
  worked	
  
to	
  clean	
  up	
  Apache	
  and	
  Resin	
  logs	
  to	
  increase	
  
space	
  on	
  UNIX	
  servers	
  for	
  better	
  performance.	
  	
  
	
  
Documentation	
  of	
  the	
  Resin	
  and	
  Perl	
  processes	
  
for	
  disaster	
  recovery	
  plans	
  were	
  completed	
  to	
  
provide	
  a	
  reference

  to

  and	
  
resolve	
  issues	
  as	
  quickly	
  as

The	
  Boards	
  and	
  Commissions	
  Application	
  for	
  
the	
  Office	
  of	
  the	
  Mayor	
  was	
  upgraded	
  to

framework	
  version	
  four	
  allowing	
  performance	
  
improvements,	
  better	
  multicore	
  support	
  and	
  
increased

  creating

Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

ISA Report and Status Updates
Ms. Shital Patel, CIO, Information Services Agency (ISA), presented the ISA
update including information on the June 4 Accela kick-off. A project manager has
been procured for that initiative with a project charter and plan being developed.
The Automated Vehicle Locator (AVL) project is going well. ISA is working with
the vendor to make sure vehicles are tested. A Request for Proposal (RFP),
coordinated with City Purchasing, will be out mid-July for the camera project. The
Liberty Shield Grant funding challenge relates to the invoicing deadline prior to
August 31. Ms. Patel continued with an update on the enterprise print
assessment and working with purchasing on how to be creative in using resources
along with Xerox to establish a base line for Total Cost of Ownership for all
services. An assessment will be done in July and the agency will be looking at
other vendors that provide the same kind of service. ISA will be making sure
business requirements are identified and solutions available. The Justis.Net
schedule has been revised with more participation on user acceptance testing
(UAT). Change orders have been received that will impact the project timeline. A
demonstration of the My Neighborhood portal will be presented today. The
property system replacement project is going well. Several meetings have been
held including an executive sponsor meeting to discuss the change order process
making sure there is business justification for changes and funding available.
These items need to be identified at sponsorship level. The team met to discuss
the need to get requirements in a timely manner. Adjustments may need to be
made to work with the Treasurer’s Office to allow for getting property tax bills out.
Northrop Grumman has been asked to provide a design study estimate for the
Municipal Wireless Project as well as an estimate for City as a pilot for the mile
square area. Total Cost of Ownership and options available need to be evaluated
before a decision to move forward can be made. The final quote was received this
morning. Ms. Patel stated that the initiative will be presented at the next IT Board
Meeting.
Staffing Update
Ms. Patel introduced new staff member, Mr. Aaron Hood, as the Chief Financial
Officer for the ISA. Mr. Hood is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a B.S. in
Accounting and an MBA. Mr. Hood recently was the Controller for a software
company. Mr. Hood stated that he was excited about coming to work for ISA and
the enterprise. Mr. Hood will be involved in the budget process, chargeback
process review, and related financial areas for ISA. In Southwest Missouri, Mr.
Hood also worked as the Controller for a rural electric cooperative. Mr. Hood
stated that in the future he hopes to provide good customer service and review
ways to increase revenues or reduce expenses for the enterprise as a whole.

Vendor Performance
Ms. Patel stated Northrop Grumman missed two Service Levels which were
impacted by one specific mainframe issue in which all applications were
unavailable. The issue has been escalated to IBM for a Root Cause Analysis.
Ms. Patel stated that Service Level has not been missed in over a year. DAI did
not miss any service levels for the month.
Ms. Enders stated that the continual improvement process on the board report is
appreciated and commented on the fantastic job done on the Microsoft Migration
Project. Mr. Robert Clifford, City Controller, added that a year ago with a recent
change in leadership ISA was involved with negotiating with NG on the contract
and in the amount of progress with ISA, NG, and DAI is remarkable.
Information Services Agency Financial Report
Ms. Beverly Dillon, Finance Manager, ISA, presented the ISA Financial Report.
Ms. Dillon stated that the report is divided into 3 different areas. The first section
reflects budget versus actual. The second section shows the revenue collected.
The third section shows the contract comparison year to date.
Action Items
Resolution 07-13 to Authorize Contractual Agreement for Project Management
Services
Mr. Ken Sorenson, Chief Technology Officer, ISA presented the Resolution for the
contract with Quest systems for a project manager. The selection process began
with a Request for Quote (RFQ) which resulted in eight responses. From those,
an initial selection of six candidates was interviewed based on their qualifications
and company’s proposal. Four candidates were brought back for second
interviews with two receiving best and final offers. Based on best and final offer
Carol Horne with Quest Information Systems, Inc. was chosen for a 1 year term
contract, with an option for extension and not to exceed $250,000. Ms. Patel
added ISA wanted the project manger to tie into the actual Accela project plan for
continuity. Mr. Clifford asked about the subcontractor status and WBE
participation as well as an update on ISA’s status of WBE’s for the next IT Board
meeting. Carol Horne is being hired as a subcontractor and qualifies as a WBE.
Ms. Beth White, Marion County Clerk, asked who the other finalist was and Mr.
Sorenson responded Crowe Chizek was the alternative selection. A motion was
made by Mr. Tom Creasser, Chief Deputy Treasurer, to approve Resolution 07-13
to Authorize Contractual Agreement for Project Management Services. The
motion was second by Ms. White and passed unanimously.

Information Technology Board
June 26, 2007 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology
Password Policy
Mr. Sorenson presented the Password Policy and stated that during the migration,
password expiration was turned off. Passwords are needed for security as well as
to provide a secure environment but not to create an undue burden on users. The
Password Policy has been reviewed and approved by IT Team. The policy
requires the user to reset the password every 90 days with notification 15 days
prior to the expiration along with instructions on how to develop a password. The
system will maintain a history of the last 24 passwords used. The end user will
have to provide a unique password 24 times in a row. The account will lock out
the user after 50 invalid login attempts. This makes it very difficult to use an
automated tool to break into the system. Mr. Sorenson stated that tools may make
1,000 attempts in a matter of seconds. The policy will automatically re-enable the
account after 15 minutes or the user may call the helpdesk to unlock the account.
Mr. Sorenson discussed the complexity aspect to make sure users have at least 8
characters in the password with characters from three of 4 categories, upper case,
lower case, a number, or special character.
Ms. Enders stated that the 50 invalid login attempts is very generous and asked if
the reason is to encourage users to call the helpdesk. Mr. Sorenson replied that
the concept is to establish a balance between individuals attempting to break in
and allowing end user enough chances to get the password correct. Ms. Patel
added that P-Synch is a password implementation tool that will allow end users to
establish 5-8 questions to help get away from users calling the helpdesk. In a
normal year the helpdesk receives approximately 25-27,000 calls for password
resets. Mr. Creasser asked if P-Synch would be implemented at the same time as
the Password Policy if so the situation will get worse before it gets better. Ms.
Patel stated ISA wants to make sure the pilot for this policy is set and to identify
the business requirements of tool prior to implementation in February or March of
next year. Ms. Patel stated that the end users are very familiar with password
reset. The major change would be the complexity issue and requiring a more
secure password. Mr. Creasser stated that discussion at the IT Team revolved
around users not being able to use words. Mr. Sorenson confirmed that due to the
complexity rule that a word cannot be used since a number or special character is
required. Mr. Clifford suggested ISA Business Relationship Managers provide tips
to identified high maintenance end-users on how to remember passwords. Mr.
Sorenson added that the implementation will be in phases to minimize calls to the
helpdesk. Dr. Thomas Inui, Mayoral Appointee, stated that users are writing
passwords down and asked what the best practice would be for the ordinary
person that does not use all the technology all the time for maintaining passwords.
The recommendation was made to include in the policy a statement directing
users to not write down their password and posting it on their monitor or
underneath their keyboard. Mr. Sorenson commented that best practice is to not
write down passwords, but if a person is going to write down their password they
4

Information Technology Board
June 26, 2007 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology
should do so on something they carry on their person. Ms. Enders stated that the
24 password cycle is rather stringent and suggested the number be lower to
accommodate the memory cycle. Dr. Inui stated that he is in support of the policy
but would suggest including things not to do. Ms. Patel offered ISA draft tips for
the users. Dr. Inui made a motion to approve the Password Policy. The motion
was second by Mr. Earl Morgan, Director of Public Safety, and passed
unanimously.
Discussion Items
Asset Management Service Level Requirement (SLR) Changes
Mr. John Chavez, Operations Manager, ISA presented the Asset Management
presentation. Mr. Chavez stated the change does not require board approval. Mr.
Chavez explained Performance Measurement which includes: monthly
measurement, physical, random sampling at predetermined locations using bar
code scanners; results will be reported quarterly; additional asset verification is
possible through the Helpdesk as users call in; and thru the PC refresh program
ISA/NG staff will have additional opportunity to verify asset information. Weighting
Factors for credits and penalties will be assessed and evaluated independently.
Mr. Chavez discussed inclusions of one or multiple departments per audit, one or
multiple locations per audit, all asset types, all data fields appropriate for an
accurate asset, and physically verify 160 assets monthly. Exclusions included
disposals prior to 2005, assets not on the network more than 30 days, user names
(tracked but not included), hard drive information (tracked but not included),
cameras, scanners PDA’s (tracked but not included in SLR).
Ms. Patel added that the agency plans to generate reports for directors or agency
designees. Mr. Clifford requested the physical inventory be coordinated with Mr.
Bob Simmons of the Office of Finance and Management. Mr. Morgan questioned
the coordination with the Office of Finance and Management inventory and asked
if the 12% a year would provide enough to meet the OFM needs. Mr. Morgan
stated that sufficient information is needed each month so that at year end it is all
captured. Mr. Clifford added that the purpose of the physical inventory is for
purchases not captured electronically and by Internal Audit recommendation. Mr.
Ron Meadows, Marion County Sheriffs Department, asked for clarification on the
weighting factor. The weight seems low especially, if the item is known compared
to PDAs or scanners which are not known. Ms. Patel stated that a physical walk
through was conducted in September, the reference is not to physical inventory. It
is the data fields, not the tracking of the asset. The data fields have been broken
down as to what is important and critical to the SLR. Mr. Meadows stated that he
is not certain redefining the SLRs is fair to NG and would like NG to respond. Mr.

5

Information Technology Board
June 26, 2007 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology
Jeffrey Hayhow, NG, stated that NG was involved in the discussion and
identification of fields through Altiris.
Dr. Inui asked what the purpose of the weighting and the audit is. Dr. Inui
commented that direction needs to be determined on where to direct help and be
accountable to the public. Dr. Inui asked about assets not monitored through
Altiris and if they were not vulnerable and under less rigorous control. Ms. Patel
added that ISA will look at implementing what the enterprise wants to capture.
Mr. Clifford requested further discussion be postponed to the July IT Board
meeting and requested staff address the board questions and concerns.
My Neighborhood Portal
Mr. Chuck Carufel, GIS Manager, ISA presented the My Neighborhood Portal
demonstration. Mr. Carufel discussed IndyGIS Goals, the initiative being built
upon previous web-services work and that the portal will replace several aging
legacy applications like the government profile and zoning browser. Mr. Carufel
stated that the components are highly reusable, flexible, scalable, and securable.
Mr. Clifford indicated staff had done a great job and added that the more
information made available the better. Mr. Carufel concluded in requesting
suggestions for information to be added be directed to him.
Justis.Net Update
Ms. Amber Watkins, Project Manager, ISA and Mr. Marv Thornsberry, Program
Manager, DAI were present for the Justis.Net Update.
Ms. Watkins discussion covered current status, upcoming for next period and
project change management. Ms. Watkins stated that eleven changes have been
requested with the first being the Lexus/Nexus enhancement that will result in a
13-day delay which was approved by the courts. Additional delays would move
the go live date back from January to February. Judge Collins stated change
request number 10 benefits many agencies. Mr. Clifford discussed new items
coming online now and the schedule to go live. Mr. Clifford stated that preference
is to start making changes to Justis.net rather than legacy Justis. Moving forward
and sticking to the plan is imperative. Judge Collins added consideration is being
taken at what changes can be in done in parallel or tandem rather than those that
have to be done in a linear fashion. Ms. White asked what role the protective
order registry has in the delay. Mr. Amitav Thamba stated the protective order
registry is not a change request and will not impact the project delay. Ms. White
continued that she is on the Steering Committee for JTAC and agrees with Mr.
Clifford on not moving back the implementation date because something else is
coming down the pipe even through the ticket pilot sounds great. The Clerk’s
6

Information Technology Board
June 26, 2007 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology
Office will participate in User Acceptance Testing and be as cooperative as
possible, as an end user they are anxious to move forward. Mr. Amitav Thamba,
Marion County Superior Courts, stated the interest is to prevent the City from
loosing an opportunity for funding and stated options are being considered in lieu
of the 800 hours.
Dr. Inui reviewed the history of the projected June 2007 Go-Live date to allow
adequate time for changes that might occur. Now another delay has been
requested moving the Go-Live date back another 7 or 8 months and added his
reluctance to do so. Judge Collins stated that this is the first time a plan complete
with dates has been available. Ms. Patel stated she disagreed and a plan has
been in place. Mr. Marv Thornsberry responded that the original plan was for the
system to be open architecture; however; DAI has not been able to move Justis.
Dr. Inui stated that all effort in enhancements in the new environment should be
the goal. Ms. White asked if the new implementation date requires Board action.
Ms. Patel stated a decision on change orders presented today is preferred. Mr.
Meadows commented that sufficient information has not been provided on the
Lexis/Nexus system to evaluate if the13 day delay is worth the delay and the
Board should not approve or disapprove that request at this time. Ms. Enders
commented that the Board does have the authority but should not misuse that
authority and should rely on ISA and NG for evaluation. Ms. Patel asked for
Board input on wanting to be given this type of information for discussion. Ms.
Enders asked if the enhancements are not implemented would the Justice system
be put in legal binds. Ms. White asked why the changes can not be made after the
Go-Live; and if going forward with the changes would result in revenue generated
now rather than January. Mr. Thamba confirmed the change would result in the
generation of revenue now. Mr. Clifford requested the Board wait and work on this
together and added he did not want to move forward with the requested changes
and delay the Go-Live date. Ms. White, Dr, Inui and Ms. Enders also did not want
to okay changes. Judge Barbara Collins abstained.
Other Business
Mr. Michael Rodman, Treasurer requested Mr. Mike Darland, Project Leader,
come up front. Mr. Rodman stated that in a normally property tax assessment
year time is needed to check accuracy and make corrections under an antiquated
system. Corrections require programming. This year has been a year of crisis.
Normal problem have been identified. Mr. Rodman wanted to take the opportunity
to commend Mr. Darland for his professional work above and beyond including
nights, worked weekends, and was available to staff working with antiqued
property system and new people in the Auditor’s Office. In addition to Mr.
Darland’s strong work ethic, he is very even tempered. Mr. Thornsberry added
that Mr. Kenny Shock, NG, should be acknowledged as well.

July 2007 ISA Report Summary
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Hybrid cameras will exist as flexible/portable
cameras for emergency situations or events. The
RFP for the neighborhood cameras will have an
option for the installation of these cameras.
Justis.Net: The project schedule for Justis.Net has
been revised. Crowe has completed the
development efforts for the security and printing
modules. In the next month, the DAI and LoGO
development is expected to be complete, and the
user acceptance testing will begin.

Completed Projects

MyNeighborhood Portal: Two minor updates to
resolve known issues have been implemented to
improve performance of the application. The GIS
team continues to work with various groups to
demonstrate the functionality of the application.

PC Refresh: – The process and procedures have
been identified and documented for this project.
Three Hundred PCs and Laptops have been
replaced as part of this project. The status of this
project shall be changed to an operational activity
going forward.

Property System Replacement: The test system
has been loaded with the current version of PVDNet
and a test database. Two issues are currently being
mitigated:
1) Tax bills and notices were created in the
legacy application and delivered the week of July
2nd. This caused various entities to become
extremely busy responding to the public. The
System Overview and Gap Analysis meetings were
scheduled to begin the week of July 9. ISA has
rescheduled the meetings to begin the week of July
23rd.
2) There has been discussion amongst the
parties regarding how the data conversion should be
accomplished. A new data conversion process has
been agreed too and a change request is being
proposed. We will be closely monitoring both the
Gap Analysis and Data Conversion tasks.

On-Going Projects
Accela Automation: The team continues to work
through the initial planning requirements, and has
started the end user project orientation sessions. In
the next month, the project charter and baseline
schedule will be completed, and analysis of the case
types and business processes shall continue.
Automated Vehicle Locator: The AVL project is on
schedule with the installations of the devices
complete for Solid Waste, Streets, Water, and
Traffic. The drop-down options for the interface for
each department have been completed, and work
will begin soon on the interface with Hansen.
Camera Projects: This initiative is broken out into
three separate projects.
Neighborhood Cameras: Work continues on the
RFP that will be sent out for installation,
maintenance, and support of the next phase of the
camera rollout. There is also testing that will be
done in the next month involving the Alvarion radio
and the Federal Signal wireless infrastructure.
Liberty Shield: Clawson completed the work at
the State and RMS will begin the camera and
antenna alignment later in the month. Fifteen
cameras are on line, and the video quality issues are
still being addressed with the vendor.
Buffer Zone: Work continues on monitoring room
at the EOC as they mount the displays. The 12

Municipal Wireless: ISA has received a proposal
from Northrop Grumman to do a feasibility study and
potentially a pilot of a municipal wireless initiative.
The study would evaluate the costs and benefits of
implementing five different applications via wireless
to see if there are potential cost savings and benefits
to this technology. The pilot would be
implementation of a particular application via
wireless in a limited area (i.e. downtown square
mile).

manageable level and thereby reduce the expenses
associated with running them, including power and
cooling requirements. Many of these servers need
to be replaced, since they are out of warranty.
Some will be replaced in the next year.
Consolidation will reduce the overall expenditure for
the physical hardware.
Jolly Grillin’ & Chillin’: The 2nd Annual ISA-NGDAI Company Picnic occurred on July 14th at Broad
Ripple Park and was well attended by the
employees and families. It was a great opportunity
to enjoy some good food, fun and fellowship with
activities for all ages. The most popular event was
the Dunk Tank, in which your favorite manager,
spouse, etc made a big splash for a worthy cause.
We are excited to report that we collected over $800
for the Children’s Guardian Home.

ISA Operational Update
Northrop Grumman True Up: ISA and Northrop
Grumman are in the process of finishing Amendment
5 that accounts for increases and decreases in the
volume of work and assets that occur throughout the
year.
Storage Assessment: In order to better utilize our
resources with respect to storage, we are engaging
(at no cost) Dell to perform a storage assessment.
Dell will assess the current capacity, how it is
allocated, the type of information stored and the cost
of storage. When this information is assessed and
needs of current projects are captured, a storage
strategy will be developed to maximize the utilization
of our storage for the future.

Vendor Performance
Northrop Grumman: The number of calls into the
helpdesk during the month of June is comparable to
the past year. NG completed 797 IMACs for the
month of June in addition to the PC Refresh. Two
SLRs were missed including:
• SLR # 1 Mainframe Production System
Availability
• SLR #26 Severity-1: Urgent Resolution
One incident again caused both SLRs to be missed.
After a software upgrade, an automated process that
clears log files failed to perform as expected. This
caused a log file to fill up and cause the JUSTIS
application to be unavailable for approximately 3.5
hours during the early morning hours of June 26th.
Since this was a severity 1, the one-hour resolution
time was not met. The automated process has since
been fully tested and is functioning as expected.

Standards & Policies: ISA continues to work with
the IT Team and its representatives to drive forward
the standards and policy committees. The teams
will be using SharePoint to collaborate on the
documents. A training session was held on July 17th
for the team.
Telephone Volume: The City/County experienced a
high volume of calls into the 327 network for the tax
bill notices. The network saw a six-fold increase in
the normal volume, but the data traffic was not
affected. The symptoms were that staff received a
fast busy when they tried to dial out. Traffic Reports
were provided by Time Warner that showed times
when the call volume was high and people were
getting busies. ISA believe that the surge in volume
resulted because the increased tax bill notices were
sent out to customers.

DAI: DAI achieved all SLRs for the month of May.
DAI continues to focus on the JUSTIS.Net and
Property Projects along with the projects under 160
hours. They have been assisting ISA in improving
the process of evaluating and estimating new project
requests coming into ISA.

Virtualization: Presently we have about 100
servers that on average run at 7% utilization of their
CPU. With virtualization software (VMware), we
hope to reduce the number of servers to a more

August 26, 2008 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

Approval of the August 26, 2008 IT Board Meeting Minutes
Judge Collins, Marion County Superior Court, made a motion to approve the July
22, 2008 IT Board Meeting Minutes. The motion was seconded by Mr. Bowes,
Marion County Assessor and carried unanimously.
Mr. Rodman, Marion County Treasurer, introduced new Board member, Julie
Phealon and noted IT Board Secretary Linda Enders’ term had expired. In the
interim, Mr. Reynolds, City Controller, will act as Board Secretary. Mr. Rodman
anticipated voting on a Board Secretary at the September meeting.
Mr. Reynolds presented an update of the CIO search sub-committee. An
interview was conducted with the sub-committee and Ms. Patel to identify
qualifications needed for the CIO position. By the end of the week the position
will be posted.
Mr. Rodman noted the City of Indianapolis recently received the second place
digital governance leadership award in San Francisco. Mr. Rodman commented
that the award shows the Indianapolis can compete nationally and is an honor for
City and staff.
Approval of the July 14, 2008 Memorandum
Mr. Reynolds made a motion to approve the July 14, 2008 Memorandum. The
motion was seconded by Ms. Ruby and carried unanimously.
Status Updates
ISA Report
Mr. Ortell, Interim CIO, presented the ISA Report beginning with an update on
the probable cause warrant initiative. Gallery numbers were added which will
aide officers with getting the correct individuals arrested on a probable cause
warrant. The RFQ web-based application has been in production for
approximately 6 years. This application enhancement eliminated the Microsoft
Access reporting component. The inter-local agreement between Health and
Hospital and ISA has been signed for the Accela project. Schedule impacts of
this change should be determined within two weeks. The business case for the
ERP was presented to the IT Board last month. ISA is looking for help on
establishing business requirements. ISA’s first IndyStat participation was last
month. The next opportunity will be September 12 at 9 for any Board members
wishing to attend. The MOSS 2007 has experienced some challenges with the

performance of the system. The implementation date has been pushed back to
September 29 with the expectation of better performance. The Property System
Replacement continues to move along and the CAMA conversion is completed.
The Auditor and Treasurer Offices training will be coordinated soon. Cameras
may be placed around Lucas Oil Stadium as part of the Public Safety Camera
Surveillance project.
Operations Update
Mr. Ortell discussed the enterprise evault project which is ahead of schedule.
Given the current rate, the project is expect to be finished late September.
Vendor Performance
NG missed 2 SLAs for the month of July. An outage in early July caused a
number of Citrix applications to be down. The fail over did not work. As a result,
the fail over has been tested and quarterly testing will be implemented. The
SLRs have not been missed previously. DAI met all of the established SLRs for
the month of July.
Mr. Reynolds, City Controller, asked that under vendor performance the IMACS
be broken down further and asked what the difference is between the 894 project
IMACS and other IMACs. Mr. Ortell explained the project IMACs are specific to
the pc refresh initiative. IMACs may be deceptive in that there may be multiple
IMACS in the swap of one machine. An IMAC may involve install of new pc,
install of new monitor or software or disposal of the old machine.
Resolution 08-16 Pictometry – Technical Correction Amendment
Ms. Thompson, Contracts Manager, ISA, presented Resolution 08-16.
Resolution 08-16 is an amendment to a resolution passed in 2007 for oblique
aerial library imaging. The original resolution was understated by $2,500 dollars.
The terms of the contract have not changed. Ms. Ruby made a motion to
approve Resolution 08-16. The motion was seconded by Judge Collins and
carried unanimously.
Resolution 08-17 Amendment Number 6 of the contract between DAI and ISA
Mr. Petrecca, SA3 Manager, ISA explained there are two parts to the
amendment. The first part is for a 2-year extension to the contract. The second
allows DAI to market the software EBIRS developed for the election with a
royalty of 10 percent of sales coming back to the City-County as revenue. The
rates of the contract were established when the current extension was put in

3

Information Technology Board

place and will remain through 2009. An increase is requested for 2010 for an
additional database administrator. The enterprise needs more database support
and will be adding an additional skill set in that area at a 5% increase. The
amendment will include a tiered SLR acceptable error rate, based on the number
of hours put into the project. This will help improve the quality of applications
delivered and improve focus of the developers efforts and help build quality
applications.
Mr. Bowes, Marion County Assessor, commented that the Resolution references
the election software and reads the transfer of ownership to DAI is in exchange
for 10% royalty for anything sold. Mr. Bowes asked what if DAI sells the software
to the enterprise. Mr. Bowes suggested the EBIRS software could be useful in
other applications of complaint management and likely could be used in other
areas of government. Mr. Bowes concern is that the enterprise would pay for the
software, transfers ownership to DAI and then pay again for use by an agency
other than the Clerk’s Office. Judge Collins had concern that any enhancements
available to other clients should but available back to City County at no cost. Mr.
Bowes asked if the not to exceed amount was for the life of the contract being a
six year period. Mr. Petrecca clarified that the not-to-exceed amount is for two
years. Ms. Schultheis, legal counsel, clarified the DAI amendment was written
for software licensing grants the City an irrevocable exclusive license to use that.
There should not be a problem to retain a license free of charge for any software.
Mr. Bowes commented that could cover the election board’s use and asked does
the language translate to another use in the enterprise. Ms. Schultheis stated
the contract says that the City and County could use the software and since ISA
has a contract with DAI to develop software for the enterprise if the enterprise
wanted the software for another use under the contract the software could be
developed for another use. Mr. Bowes stated concern about the license and
enhancements and requested the language be clear that the enterprise receives
the benefits of enhancements. Ms. Schultheis agreed to the recommendations
and added the amendment has not been signed yet.
Judge Collins, Marion County Superior Courts, make a motion to delay
Resolution 08-17 for a month to allow for questions to be answered and to obtain
items from ISA. Judge Collins stated that she is in need of additional information,
access to the original agreement and any amendments, and the statement of
work. Issues are beginning to surface with applications especially as the
enterprise is moving forward with Odyssey. The Statement of Work (SOW) does
not provide access to access and software development. Judge Collins added
human resources have been cut in half from 10 to five. Ms. Ruby, Council
Appointee, asked if there is a need for provisions to prevent delay with the DAI
contract. Mr. Ortell noted that the risk of the Board not approving the contract
which expires at the end of the year would be insufficient time to prepare and

4

Information Technology Board
August 26, 2008 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

review an RFP. Mr. Ortell stated information requested has been provided to the
department. There seems to be some misunderstanding as to what the contract
is or is supposed to be. The DAI contract is primarily a maintenance support
contract with provisions for minor enhancements as time allows and is not a fullfledged application development contract.
The motion was seconded by Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Rodman asked if action by the
Board were delayed to the September 22 meeting would there be anything that is
time sensitive. Mr. Petrecca replied that as long as the Board approves the
contract no. Should the Board prefer an RFP, ISA would not have time to write,
make public and evaluate by end of year. Ms. Ruby stated she has no problems
with the vendor but would like Judge Collins’ questions answered. Mr. Bowes
inquired if the contract provisions included an option for continuation on a month
to month basis. Ms. Thompson clarified that the contract requires 180-day notice
to terminate the contract but was not certain of other provisions. Mr. Petrecca
commented that an earlier amendment might have covered an extension up to
90 days. Mr. Ortell offered to follow up on the contract extension question.
Motion was called and carried unanimously.
Resolution 08-18 21-Tech Contract
Mr. Petrecca and Mr. Huber, Director of Enterprise Development, Mayor’s Office
presented Resolution 08-18. The resolution is to authorize the interim CIO to
negotiate and execute an agreement between ISA and 21 Tech, a Microsoft
certified vendor. Mr. Petrecca stated ISA has been negotiating with and
exploring a scope of work to help implement the PerformancePoint software.
The software was purchased from Microsoft. ISA needs implementation
assistance in deploying for the use of support for the IndyStat program and other
performance management initiatives within the City and County. Staff has been
working with 21 Tech and come to an agreement of scope of services to get
started using this application. The authorization is not to exceed $180,000. The
vendor is not local and given fluctuation and recent increases in airline expenses
staff wanted cushion to avoid returning for additional funds. Mr. Reynolds
requested a background on what the product will do. Mr. Huber explained that
essentially the performance point software will enable automation of the
generation of reports for the IndyStat program. The initial scope focuses on City
Departments but will be rolled out in a way that is easily adopted by County
agencies. The scope of this phase of the tool will cover FAMIS to generate
financial metrics fairly quickly and the GIS component with Hansen. The Hansen
system within the Department of Public Works has the highest volume of citizen
complaints. Mr. Reynolds commented last month the Board was presented a
business case for an Enterprise Resource Planning system which would

5

Information Technology Board
August 26, 2008 Meeting Minutes
Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

potentially replace the finance system and asked if this particular product would
be capable of extracting data where ever the information is housed. Mr.
Petrecca explained once the underlying metrics are decided upon, the process is
to extract from where the information is housed, transform, and load. Mr. Huber
added that having a tool will help individuals understand the value an ERP

Leading the way in enterprise-wide technology

each Board member at the July 22nd IT Board
meeting. ISA and OFM are currently working on an
RFS to hire a consulting firm to further define
business and technical requirements. This
consulting firm will be responsible for drafing an RFP
for potential vendors. Estimate six months before an
RFP is issued.
FileNet Upgrade and Interface Development: The
bulk import of the documents from the existing
version into the updated version of FileNet is
complete. In parallel with the bulk import, a
prototype solution of the middleware between the
upgraded FileNet and Accela was warmly received
by customers. Custom development for FileNet
Capture (scan-stations) continues and must await a
finalization of Accela CAP-types relating to Health
and Hospital before code finalization. Other
outstanding issues to be addressed include enduser training and security.

On-Going Projects
Accela Automation: Now that an agreement
between ISA and Health and Hospital is finalized,
integration of the Health & Hospital cases has
begun. The additional 350 hours of work needed to
complete this integration caused us to move the
overall go-live date to December. Configuration of
Accela to meet the Indianapolis-specific
requirements continues: Configuration 80%;
Interfaces 74%; reports 68%, Data mapping/conv
72%. Testing continues but shifts from configuration
testing to a focus on data conversion. Training
development is complete. Train-the-trainer starts in
early Sept. End user training rollout begins in early
October..

IndyStat: ISA continues to participate in the
monthly IndyStat meetings for City Departments.
ISA has also participated as the first County Agency
in our second IndyStat presentation. ISA and the
Mayor’s Office are near kick-off status for the
implementation of Performance Point, a tool we will
use to pull data from various locations to report
through the IndyStat initiative. The pilot
implementation will focus on Famis, Hansen, and a
GIS interface and is expected to run through first
quarter of 2009.

Criminal/Civil Case Management: As some of the
Township Small Claims Courts are proceeding with
Odyssey, the statewide case management system
being implemented by the Indiana Judicial
Technology and Automation Committee (JTAC), an
implementation plan for Marion Superior Courts is
still being decided.

MOSS 2007: The Indy.gov public website is
focusing on a go-live date of September 29, 2008.
ISA and Method Factory are working through any
remaining issues and doing some final testing. The
Intranet (internal web presence) is still in the pilot
phase while ISA is determining the best approach to
roll out to the Enterprise.

eCitation: e-Citation is a project to create an
interface between JTAC’s new electronic ticketing
system, which the Indiana State Police is using
during traffic stops, and the JUSTIS system. This
interface will electronically accept and load uniform
traffic tickets from e-Citation into the JUTSIS
system. DAI has completed Marion County’s side of
the interface and is now testing records coming from
JTAC to assist them with verifying and correcting
any problems on their side. Once this is complete
the next step is to begin User Acceptance Testing by
the Marion County Traffic Court Clerks.

Municipal Wireless Feasibility Study: The “Option
1” or interim/shortened version of the feasibility study
is now complete and the comprehensive report has
been received and transmitted to the project
sponsor. The sponsor’s presentation with the
Municipal Wireless Advisory Committee is scheduled
for the upcoming period to facilitate a determination
of the way in which the feasibility study should
proceed.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The
Enterprise Resource Planning Needs Analysis
Document is finalized and copies were distributed to

Verizon Wireless Services: The Enterprise is in
the process of switching cell, blackberry, and air
card services over to Verizon Wireless. The Verizon
representative is working directly with Departments
and Agencies to swap out their cell phones. ISA is
managing the migration of the blackberries and air
cards. To date, ISA and DPR are complete with the
swap of the blackberry devices. Other Departments
and Agencies are being worked into a schedule to
meet the needs of each entity.

Property System Replacement: The Assessors’
Deeds/Transfers functionality was implemented into
production on Wednesday, August 27.The 07pay08
personal property data was also merged with the
real estate data in PVDNet. The Assessors’ data
conversion from the legacy system to PVDNet was
completed and spreadsheets containing data
cleansing items were distributed to the Assessors.
Auditor and Treasurer Functionality training and
testing have begun. Also, training for the APEX
sketch tool and Ad Hoc reporting tool is taking place
at the township sites. The Property Tax System
Replacement Project continues to be managed to
support the integrated timeline for all property taxrelated projects, specifically for the production of the
07pay08 provisional and 07pay08 reconciliation tax
bills.
Public Safety Camera Surveillance Project:
Phase III Critical Infrastructure Camera installs are
nearing completion. Infrastructure installation has
begun at Lucas Oil Stadium. Three cameras are
installed and operational near the new stadium.

ISA Operational Update
Data Center Network Infrastructure Upgrade:
The objectives of this initiative are to increase the
capacity and scalability of the data center network;
improve airflow by reducing the amount of cable
underneath the raised floor space and reduce the
effort required to manage the
infrastructure. Deployment of network switches
continued is now about 70% complete. Overall the
project is approximately 90% complete.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): A new
software application and new equipment are being
tested and deployed to the Juvenile Center. The
new application and equipment is expected to be
installed and operational by mid-October.
Strategic Plan: In September, the IT Board began
holding monthly working sessions to further discuss
and move forward with the Strategic Planning
efforts. ISA has begun working toward several of
the goals and developing timelines for the remaining
goals.

Enterprise Vault (E-Vault): Importation of olderformat e-mail archives continues and is ahead of
rollout plan forecast due to the continued impressive
efforts demonstrated by the project team. To date,
over 8000 users have been migrated and
approximately 1200 users remain. The project is
expected to wrap up by October of this year.

Supervisory Special Report: The IMPD
Supervisory Special application generates a detailed
report for all incidents which involve one or more of
the following: resisting arrest, pursuit, chemical
spray, taser, impact weapon or forced entry. The
generated report(s) are automatically submitted and
routed through the established chain-of-command
(Sergeant-Lieutenant-Captain-Commander) for
review and approval. After approval, the report is
routed to the planning and research division of
IMPD. This application is currently in User
Acceptance Testing (UAT) awaiting approval from
the customer.

Exchange 2007 Upgrade: The objective of this
initiative is to design an infrastructure with the
intention of leveraging the new features and
scalability of Exchange 2007 that, when
implemented, would lower the cost of email services
provided to City/County agencies and department.
Dell has completed the design document. Next
steps are to identify the cost of any capital
investments that may be needed and provision the
