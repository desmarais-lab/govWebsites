Annual Drinking Water Quality Report
The Water We Drink

City of Martinsville Water Utility 2015
We're pleased to present to you this year's Annual Quality Water Report. This report is designed to inform you about the quality water
and services we deliver to you every day. Our constant goal is to provide you with a safe and dependable supply of drinking water. We want you
to understand the efforts we make to continually improve the water treatment process and protect our water resources. We are committed to
ensuring the quality of your water. Our water source are 3 wells located on the north west edge of the City of Martinsville drawing from the
aquifer that surrounds the well field.
We have a source water assessment plan available from our office that provides more information such as potential sources of contamination.
I'm pleased to report that our drinking water is safe and meets federal and state requirements. This report shows our water quality and what it
means.
If you have any questions about this report or concerning your water utility, please contact Scott Manley of the City of Martinsville Water
Utility, 765-342-2707. We want our valued customers to be informed about their water utility. If you want to learn more, please attend any of
our regularly scheduled meetings. They are held on the first and third Monday‚Äôs of the month. Meetings are held in the Council
Chambers on the second floor of Martinsville City hall located at 59 S Jefferson St. Martinsville In. 46151.
The City of Martinsville Water Utility routinely monitors for constituents in your drinking water according to Federal and State laws. This
table shows the results of our monitoring for the period of January 1st to December 31st, 2015. As water travels over the land or underground, it
can pick up substances or contaminants such as microbes, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radioactive substances. All drinking water,
including bottled drinking water, may be reasonably expected to contain at least small amounts of some constituents. It's important to
remember that the presence of these constituents does not necessarily pose a health risk.
In this table you will find many terms and abbreviations you might not be familiar with. To help you better understand these terms we've
provided the following definitions:

Non-Detects (ND) - laboratory analysis indicates that the constituent is not present.
Parts per million (ppm) or Milligrams per liter (mg/l) - one part per million corresponds to one minute in two years or a single penny in
$10,000.
Parts per billion (ppb) or Micrograms per liter - one part per billion corresponds to one minute in 2,000 years, or a single penny in
$10,000,000.
Parts per trillion (ppt) or Nanograms per liter (nanograms/l) - one part per trillion corresponds to one minute in 2,000,000 years, or a single
penny in $10,000,000,000.
Parts per quadrillion (ppq) or Picograms per liter (picograms/l) - one part per quadrillion corresponds to one minute in 2,000,000,000 years or
one penny in $10,000,000,000,000.

LEAD AND COPPER
Definitions:
Action Level Goal (ALG) ‚Äì The level of a contaminate in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. ALGs allow
for a margin of safety.
Action Level ‚Äì The concentration of a contaminant which, if exceeded, triggers treatment or other requirements which a water system must
follow.
‚ÄúIf present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking
water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. City of Martinsville, Water Utility is
responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your
water has been setting for several hours, you can minimize the potential of lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes
before using the water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested.
Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water
Hotline or at http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.‚Äù

The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water
travels over the surface of land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and
can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. Contaminants that may be present in source water
include:
ÔÇ∑ Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural
livestock operations, and wildlife.
ÔÇ∑ Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban storm runoff, industrial or
domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.
ÔÇ∑ Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, storm water runoff, and residential uses.
ÔÇ∑ Organic chemicals, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum
production, and can, also come from gas stations, urban storm water runoff, and septic systems.
ÔÇ∑ Radioactive materials, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.
In order to ensure tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by
public water systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water, which must provide
the same protection for public health.

All sources of drinking water are subject to potential contamination by substances that are naturally occurring or man made. These substances
can be microbes, inorganic or organic chemicals and radioactive substances. All drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be
expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that the water
poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection
Agency‚Äôs Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791.
MCL‚Äôs are set at very stringent levels. To understand the possible health effects described for many regulated constituents, a person would
have to drink 2 liters of water every day at the MCL level for a lifetime to have a one-in-a-million chance of having the described health effect.
Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as
persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune
system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water
from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other
microbiological contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).
Please call our office if you have questions.
We at The City of Martinsville, Water Utility work around the clock to provide top quality water to every tap, said Scott D. Manley. We ask
that all our customers help us protect our water sources, which are the heart of our community, our way of life and our children‚Äôs future.

LEAD AND COPPER
Definitions:
Action Level Goal (ALG) &ndash;The level of a contaminate in drinking water
below which there is no known or expected risk to health. ALGs allow for a
margin of safety.  
Action Level &ndash;The concentration of a contaminant which, if exceeded,
triggers treatment or other requirements which a water system must follow.
&ldquo;If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems,
especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is
primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home
plumbing. City of Martinsville, Water Utility is responsible for providing high
quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in
plumbing components. When your water has been setting for several hours, you
can minimize the potential of lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds
to 2 minutes before using the water for drinking or cooking. If you are
concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested.
Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take
to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at
http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.&rdquo;

 Microbiological Contaminants:
(1) Total Coliform. Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the
environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially-harmful,
bacteria may be present. Coliforms were found in more samples than allowed and
this was a warning of potential problems.
(2) Fecal coliform/E.Coli. Fecal coliforms and E. coli are bacteria whose
presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal
wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as

The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include
rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels
over the surface of land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally
occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up
substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.
Contaminants that may be present in source water include:
    * Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from
      sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock
      operations, and wildlife.
    * Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-
      occurring or result from urban storm runoff, industrial or domestic
      wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.
    * Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such
      as agriculture, storm water runoff, and residential uses.
    * Organic chemicals, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals,
      which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production,
      and can, also come from gas stations, urban storm water runoff, and
      septic systems.
    * Radioactive materials, which can be naturally occurring or be the result
      of oil and gas production and mining activities.
In order to ensure tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations that
limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water
systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for
contaminants in bottled water, which must provide the same protection for
public health.
All sources of drinking water are subject to potential contamination by
substances that are naturally occurring or man made. These substances can be
microbes, inorganic or organic chemicals and radioactive substances. All
drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain
at least small amounts of some contaminants.  The presence of contaminants does
not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk. More information
about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the
Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-
426-4791.
MCL&rsquo;s are set at very stringent levels. To understand the possible health
effects described for many regulated constituents, a person would have to drink
2 liters of water every day at the MCL level for a lifetime to have a one-in-a-
million chance of having the described health effect.
Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the
general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer
undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people
with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can
be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about
drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on
appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other
microbiological contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline
(800-426-4791).
