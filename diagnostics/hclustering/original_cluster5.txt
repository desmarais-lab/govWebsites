History of the Municipal Clerk

Early Beginnings

The Municipal Clerk is the oldest of public servants in local government,
along with the tax collector. The profession traces back before Biblical
times. For example, the modern Hebrew translation of Town Clerk is "Mazkir
Ha'ir" which literally translated, means city or town Reminder: "The early
keepers of archives were often called Remembrancers:" and before writing
came into use, their memory served as the public record.
Ancient Greece had a city secretary who read official documents publicly.
At the opening of a meeting, one of his first duties was to decree a curse
upon anyone who should seek to deceive the people.
St. Paul and his followers during his missionary work in Persia (now
western Turkey) owed their safety to the action of a town clerk. As related
in Acts 19:22-41, written A.D. 58, the artisans of Ephesus who made the
idols of the time, feared the effect of St. Paul's missionary work on their
trade. They incited a mob to seize two of Paul's followers. The town clerk,
however, spoke out against this action and insisted that charges laid
against these men had to be settled in the proper manner and before the
proper authorities. There was no justification for riotous conduct. With
that, he dispersed the crowd.
Reportedly, the regency line of France descends from the office of the
clerk! According to James Bryce in his book "The Holy Roman Empire," there
is a direct link between the position of Mayor of the Palace, a clerical
post created by the Merovingian Kings of France, and all subsequent Kings
of France.
In the eighth century, the Frankish Kings of France depended on the Mayor
of the Palace to perform all manner of clerical and administrative tasks
for the King including collecting taxes and fees, publishing documents,
keeping state records and assisting in the enforcement of the King's
justice.
In 751, the Merovingian King, Childeric, was deposed and his assistant,
Pippin, the Mayor of the Palace, became not only the monarch of France but
was simultaneously created a Patrician of Rome by Pope Gregory the Third.
Pippin was, in turn, father of the great Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman
Emperor and founder of the Carolingian Dynasty of Europe on High, which in
successive generations, produced the Kings of France, as well as the
Emperors of Germany and Austria.

Development in England

The title "clerk" as we know it developed from the Latin "clericus." During
the Middle Ages, when scholarship and writing were limited to the clergy,
clerk came to mean a scholar, especially one who could read, write and thus
serve as a notary, secretary, accountant and recorder.
In ancient England, the township (surrounded by its hedge or "tun") and the
borough (an outpost fortified with a wall) developed a strong system of
democratic local government and one of the first officials these freemen
elected was the "Clarke."
The beginning of the office of city clerk in England can be traced back to
1272 A.D. in the history of the Corporation of Old London. The
"Remembrancer" was called upon to remind the councilors (members of the
council) what had transpired at their previous meetings, since the meeting
of the early councils were not recorded in written minutes.
In 1354, the Mayor of Nottingham appointed the Clarke and provided for his
remuneration. In 1439, Symkyn Birches was awarded the office of "Toun
Clerk" in another community for the rest of his life. In 1477, Thoman
Carton, a town clerk, was the first English printer, and served as diplomat
for the King. In 1485, Nicholas Lancaster, the Clarke, became Mayor of
York.
In the 1500's in England, there were not only the "Town Clarke" but also
the "Clerc Comptroller of the King's Honorable Household." In 1603, there
was a "Clarke General of the Armie." Indeed, King Henry the Eighth had a
"Clarke of the Spicery" and King Charles had his "Clarke of the Robes."
Perhaps the strongest statement of the unique position occupied by the
Municipal Clerk is by an English Court in the Middle Ages ruling in the
case, Hurle-Hobbs ex parte Riley and another. Concerning this case, Chief
Justice Lord Caldecote observed:
"The office of town clerk is an important part of the machinery of local
government. He may be said to stand between the local Council and the
ratepayers. He is there to assist by his advice and action the conduct of
public affairs in the borough and, if there is a disposition on the part of
the council, still more on the part of any member of the council, to ride
roughshod over his opinions, the question must at once arise as to whether
it is not his duty forthwith to resign his office or, at any rate, to do
what he thinks right and await the consequences."

Colonial Development

When the early colonists came to America they set up forms of local
government to which they had been accustomed, and the office of the clerk
was one of the first to be established. When the colonists first settled in
Plymouth, Massachusetts, they quickly appointed a person to act as
recorder. That person kept all the vital records for birth, marriages and
deaths for the church, as well as various other records of appointments,
deeds, meetings, and the election of officers at the annual town meeting.
Indeed, in Massachusetts, the town clerk was one of the earliest offices
established in colonial towns. The settlers were well aware of the
importance of keeping accurate written records of their agreements and
actions including grants of land, regulations governing animals, the
collection of taxes and the expenditure of town funds.
The person given the responsibility for recording these orders was also
often given other duties, such as sweeping the meeting-house and selling
the seats, ringing the bell, and paying the bounty for jays and blackbirds
whose heads were presented to him by the citizens. By the middle of the
17th century, the title town clerk appears in town records and this title
has continued to the present.
One of the earliest statutory duties imposed by the Massachusetts General
Court on town clerks was recording births, deaths and marriages. Since that
time, the General Court has formalized by statute many of the duties first
delegated by vote of the town and has added others. By 1692, the town clerk
was required to enter and record divisions of land and orders of the
selectmen as well as all town votes, orders and grants. Warrants directed
to the constable for the collection of taxes were to be signed by the
assessors or the town clerk. Between 1742 and 1756, the General Court made
the town clerk responsible for maintaining a list showing each inhabitant's
property value and for producing it, if necessary, to substantiate a
person's voting rights. The town clerk was required to administer and
record the oath of office taken by town officials. By 1776, the town clerk
was empowered to call town meetings to elect selectmen if a majority of the
selectmen had moved from the town or were absent in the service of the
country.
The office of town clerk of Wethersfield, Connecticut, was established in
1639 and that person was to "keep a record of every man's house and land,"
and to present "a fairly written" copy of such to every General Court to be
recorded by the secretary of the colony. In the first municipal election in
New York City in 1689, the offices of Sheriff, Mayor and City Clerk were on
the ballot.
The Puritan town of Woodstock, Massachusetts, appointed a town clerk in
1693 to record deeds and mortgages and to record the books. Because the
town's people wanted to keep him on a permanent basis, he was given 20
acres of land and a fee of 12 pence for each town meeting plus 6 pence for
each grant filled. The Town Clerk of Middleboro, Mass., on the other hand
was compensated with "one load of fish taken at the herring-weir and
delivered to his house." Three centuries later, one of his seventh-great-
grandchildren is serving as City Recorder of the city of Newport, Oregon.

Summary

Over the years, Municipal Clerks have become the hub of government, the
direct link between the inhabitants of their community and their
government. The Clerk is the historian of the community, for the entire
recorded history of the town (city) and its people is in his or her care.
The eminent political scientist, Professor William Bennett Munro, writing
in one of the first textbooks on municipal administration (1934), stated:
"No other office in municipal service has so many contracts. It serves the
mayor, the city council, the city manager (when there is one), and all
administrative departments without exception. All of them call upon it,
almost daily, for some service or information. Its work is not spectacular,
but it demands versatility, alertness, accuracy, and no end of patience.
The public does not realize now many loose ends of city administration this
office pulls together."
These words, written more than 50 years ago, are even more appropriate
today.

having had the advice and assistance of the Tree Advisory Board, established in
said Ordinance, hereby promulgates the following as the Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice for the City of Evansville, Indiana,
hereinafter called the Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
2.0 Policy
2.1 All work on public trees shall comply with the “Ordinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees” of the City of Evansville, Indiana, and this
Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
2.2 The Arboricultural Specifications Manual shall be adhered to at all times, but it may

2.5 The Evansville City Arborist, in consultation with the Tree Advisory Board, shall
have the jurisdiction, authority, control, supervision, and direction over all trees

4

Last Revised 2/4/10

planted or growing in or upon public property, and the planting, removal, care,
maintenance, and protection thereof.
3.0 General Specifications
3.1 The Arboricultural Specifications contained in this document are to serve as a
standard for all work performed on or with all public trees and development
projects that include tree plantings as required by the Evansville Area Planning
Commission. These standards will apply whether the work is performed “inhouse”, contractually by private businesses, or by private individuals.
3.2 All terms used in this manual, which are defined in the “Ordinance of the City of
Evansville, Indiana Concerning Trees”, shall hold the same definition in this
manual.
3.3 A permit shall be obtained from the Tree Advisory Board, through the City Arborist’s
office, before any person, either for himself or another, prunes, removes, or
destroys any public tree.
3.4 All requests for bid specifications for landscaping should be reviewed by the City
Arborist and/or other qualified members of the Tree Advisory Board before they
are sent out to potential bidders. This will allow trained arborists and
horticulturists a chance to see whether items in the bid need to be altered for
long-term plant survival.
3.5 A site meeting shall be conducted between the contractor, the City Arborist, and a
representative from the public department responsible for the project before any
landscape work is to be performed. During such meeting the City Arborist shall
inform the contractor how all work shall be performed including, but not limited to,
proper planting techniques, proper irrigation techniques, proper mulching
techniques, and proper maintenance techniques. The City Arborist shall also
make clear to the contractor their responsibilities outlined in the contract for the
landscaping, and the contractor’s guarantee/warranty period for all vegetation
planted and/or maintained by them.
3.6 Oversight for contract administration of landscaping shall be performed by city
arborist. The City Arborist shall monitor, and regulate work done by the
landscape contractor(s) throughout the contract period. All non-compliance
issues of the contract by the contractor shall be reported to the public department
responsible for the project, and to the Tree Advisory Board. Follow up work and
routine maintenance work needed after the contract has been fulfilled shall be
determined by the City Arborist, and reported to the appropriate department.
3.7 It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of cutting, trimming,
pruning, or removing any tree within the City of Evansville, for hire, without first
procuring a license as required by the “Ordinance of the City of Evansville,
Indiana Concerning Trees” codes 2.90.010 through 2.90.150.

5

Last Revised 2/4/10

3.8 Authorized work on or with public trees neither expresses nor implies a right to
violate any local, state, or federal law while in the process of performing such
work.
3.9 All such work shall be conducted in a manner as to cause the least possible
interference with, or annoyance, to others.
3.10 All personnel utilized for work on or with trees shall be trained to perform the work
properly and safely in accordance with these Arboricultural Specifications, and
ANSI standards.
3.11 Only a licensed tree pruner shall perform work on trees, except during
emergencies. An emergency shall be an instance when a public tree(s) has
been severely damaged by storms or other causes or is obstructing utility wires,
etc.
The Board of Public Works or public utilities may without permit resort to topping
or severe cutting back of limbs of public trees, but should report all such actions
to the Tree Advisory Board.
3.12 A licensed tree pruner is recommended, but shall not be required, for trees being
pruned or removed as part of a new development on public property, so long as
the project has been approved by Area Planning Commission. Tree preservation
and any tree pruning work that is required, shall be done in accordance with the
standards set forth in this manual.
3.13 Any use of tools and equipment for pruning, trimming, repairing, maintaining and
removing trees shall be in accordance with ANSI standards.
3.14 Approved street and sidewalk warning devices shall be in position as required at all
times while work on public trees is being performed. Adequate barricades and
other warning devices shall be placed and flagmen shall be stationed as
necessary for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. All closures of public
rights-of-way shall be approved by the Evansville Safety Board.
3.15 Whenever overhead utility lines, gas lines, water lines, sewer lines, or other
improvements upon a public area are jeopardized by any authorized tree pruning
or removal activities, the proper authorities of the utilities involved shall be
consulted prior to performing any work activity and all requested precautions by
any such authority shall be followed. Those performing work shall be responsible
for having utilities located prior to planting, stump grinding, or any other type of
digging.
3.16 Companies that violate or ignore bid agreements during the installation or
maintenance of landscape plantings, or refuse to honor warranties, shall be

6

Last Revised 2/4/10

deemed a non-responsible bidder, and shall be denied an award on a bid for
landscaping for a period of no less than three years from the date of the violation.
3.17 All contracted landscape plantings shall have a minimum of two, or preferred three
year warranty. Bids should be worded such that landscape maintenance for a
minimum of two years, or for a preferred three year period, be performed by the
landscape installation company. Whoever plants landscaping on site shall be
responsible for their health. This will promote more conscientious planting
practices, and avoid the need to determine blame for tree failure.
3.18 All companies bidding on planting/maintenance must develop a complete postplanting maintenance program. This will include, but not be limited to: irrigation,
fertilization, pruning/training, and pest control. Pest control refers to controlling
insects, diseases, weeds, and other harmful agents.
4.0 Planting
4.1 Acceptable Tree Species. The Appendices contain lists of tree species or their
varieties and cultivars acceptable and approved for planting on public property.
No species other than those included in this list may be planted on public
property without written permission of the Tree Advisory Board.
4.2 Size. Unless otherwise specified by the Tree Advisory Board, all species and their
cultivars or varieties shall conform to ANSI standards.
•
•
•
•
•

Medium and Large trees (listed in Tables II and III) – 2½” caliper;
Small trees (listed in Table I) – 1½” caliper;
Medium and large evergreen trees and multi-stem trees – 12’ height
Small evergreen trees and multi-trunk trees – 10’ height
Shrubs – 5-gallon containers or equivalent balled and burlapped.

4.3 Grade. Unless otherwise allowed for specific reasons, all trees shall have
comparatively straight trunks (except for those that are multi-trunk), well
developed leaders and tops, and the roots shall not only be characteristic of the
species, cultivar or variety, but also shall exhibit evidence of proper nursery
pruning practices. They shall have acceptable balance between top and root. At
the time of planting, all trees must be free of mechanical injuries, and other
objectionable features that tend to affect the future form and health of the plant.
4.4 Location and Spacing.
4.4.1 Pavement and tree spacing for street trees and trees in public areas.
The distance that trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may
be no closer than the following: Small trees, two (2) feet; Medium and Large
trees, three (3) feet.

7

Last Revised 2/4/10

4.4.2 Pavement and tree spacing for trees in parking lots. The distance that
trees may be planted from curbs, curb lines and sidewalks may be no closer than
the following: Small trees, three (3) feet; Medium trees, four (4) feet; and Large
trees, five (5) feet.
4.4.3 Driveways, Alleys and Intersections. Trees shall be planted at least
fifteen (15) feet from driveways and alleys. No street trees shall be planted at an
intersection corner within 25 feet of the curved intersection.
4.4.4 Utilities. No tree, other than those listed as small trees in the appendices
of this manual, may be planted within twenty (25) feet of any overhead utility
wire. Minimal planting distances from overhead utility wires should be based
upon mature tree height and spread. Species shall be selected for planting
under utility wires so that the maximum height of the trees at maturity will not be
the same or more as the height of the lowest electrical transmission wire. Trees
that have canopy heights exceeding the height of transmission wires shall be
spaced from utility poles at least a minimum of one-half (1/2) of their total mature
canopy spread plus ten (10) feet.
4.4.5 Other Utilities. Shade trees shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15)
feet from all lampposts and should allow for proper lighting. Trees planted near
light posts shall be monitored, and pruned as needed, to prevent obstruction of
light.
4.4.6 Spacing Between Trees. As a general recommendation, trees and shrubs
should be spaced so that they are separated by a minimum of one-third (1/3) of
their total mature canopy spread.
4.4.7 Miscellaneous. All planting on unpaved streets without curbs or sidewalks
must have the approval of the Tree Advisory Board, who shall determine the
location of the tree, so that it will not be injured or destroyed when the street is
curbed and paved, or when sidewalks are constructed. No street tree shall be
planted within ten (10) feet of any fire hydrant or stop sign. Where overhead
lines or building setback presents a special problem, the selection of planting site
and species shall be determined by the Tree Advisory Board.
4.5 Tree Transport and Storage. Trees shall be transported fully covered by tarp(s) to
prevent them from drying out and getting wind burn. During transport and
storage roots and root balls shall be routinely inspected and watered as
necessary to prevent from drying out. If proper moisture content of roots and
root balls cannot be maintained on site, they shall be healed in properly until they
are planted.
4.6 Tree Inspection. Trees shall be inspected for proper root to shoot ratio before
being accepted according to ANSI Z60.1-2004, and shall be replaced with
acceptable root stock when rejected. Trees shall also be rejected if they have

8

Last Revised 2/4/10

defects or have poor structure for that species. Balled and burlapped trees shall
have burlap removed from top of root ball to inspect root collar depth to
determine if the tree is acceptable.
4.7 Tree Planting Method.
4.7.1 Planting Depth and Width. The hole for tree planting shall be dug to the
depth of the measurement of the tree being planted from the root flare to the
bottom of the root ball. Care shall be taken to not confuse the tree graft, if one is
present, with the root flare (see figure 1). The root flare of trees that are
containerized or balled and burlapped shall be exposed to determine this
measurement before digging. Pits for the planting of trees shall be at least three
times wider than the diameter of the roots or root ball. The edges of planting pits
shall be scarified to prevent glazing of soil after digging.

Figure 1. Root Graft Vs. Root Collar (Flare)
4.7.2 Removal of Foreign Objects. Brick, rock, foreign roots, and other debris
that is not considered soil shall be removed from planting pits. Burlap, ropes,
and wires shall be either entirely removed from balled and burlapped trees, or cut
back at least 1/3rd down the sides of the root ball before backfill is used. Soil
may also be completely removed from balled and burlapped trees so long as
roots are not damaged. Containers shall be completely removed from trees
before planting containerized trees, and containerized tree roots shall be pruned
and spread apart as necessary to improve future root growth and prevent root
girdling. Roots of the trees shall be kept damp during these processes to prevent
drying out.
4.7.3 Tree Placement. The tree shall be centered in the planting hole with the
tree completely upright and with the root collar between zero to one inches above
ground level, and absolutely no lower than ground level. If the root collar is not at
ground level, soil shall be added or removed from the bottom of the pit until the

9

Last Revised 2/4/10

proper height is achieved. If soil is placed into pit to adjust root collar depth it
shall be tamped down before backfilling.
4.7.4 Amendments. Only the original soil removed shall be used as backfill, and
no soil amendments shall be used, unless the entire site is being amended with
the same amendment material and at the same percentage of amendment
uniformly.
4.7.5 Backfilling and Watering. As soil is placed into hole, clumps of soil shall
be broken up to a maximum size of ½ inch size clumps. Water shall be used
during backfilling intermittently to improve soil settling. When the planting is
completed, the entire root area shall be thoroughly saturated with water. Care
shall be taken to prevent the tree from becoming off center during this process.
4.7.6 Staking. Tree trunks shall be guyed, or supported in an upright position,
according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or supports shall be
installed so that they will neither girdle or cause serious injury to the tree nor
endanger public safety. Tree stakes, guy wires, and supports for trees shall be
removed the spring following the first full growing season.
4.7.7 Trunk Protection.Tree trunk protectors, if used, shall consist of wire mesh
screen, which shall be placed around trunk loosly in a way that it can be slid up
and down the trunk, unimpeded, and shall not be tied to the trunk, but shall be
attached to itself in the manner of a loose tube around the tree (see figure 2).
Trunk protection shall be removed the spring after the first full growing season.

Figure 2: Trunk Protection.
4.7.8 Tree Grates and Mulch. Organic mulch shall be immediately placed
around trees after planting for a minimum distance of three feet, or to the edge of
pavement, whichever comes first. The mulch layer shall be applied at a minimum
height of two inches, to a maximum height of four inches. Excessive mulch will
not be piled against the tree trunk (mulch volcano), and all mulch shall be pulled
away from the trunk one inch (1”). Acceptable mulch materials include wood

10

Last Revised 2/4/10

chips, shredded bark, bark nuggets, and similar products. No other mulch
material may be substituted without authorization from the Tree Advisory Board.
Grates shall not be used around trees.

Mulch shall be
pulled one inch
from trunk of the
tree

The root collar/flare shall be
0 to 1 inches above ground
level and not planted under
ground level

Hole should be dug 3 times
the width of the root ball

Mulch shall be 2 to 4 inches thick, in a flat ring around the tree
Use no
amendments or
fertilizers in fill

Cut wires,
rope and
burlap more
rd
than 1/3
down from top
of root ball

Figure 3: Proper tree planting.
5.0 Newly Planted Tree Care.
5.1 General. Newly planted trees (trees planted within 3 years), shrubs and other
plants shall require special maintenance for two or three growing seasons
following planting. All maintenance practices shall follow approved arboricultural
standards.
5.2 Watering. Trees shall be watered when one inch of rain water has not fallen within
7 days, or within 7 days of last watering. Proper watering of trees shall consist of
the equivalent of one inch of rain (1/2 gallon per square foot of soil) for the root
zone per tree per week. Gator Bags can be used, but must be completely filled
once per week for proper watering. Programmable or manual irrigation systems
may also be used, but shall be programmed or run only once per week after lawn
is established. To prevent overwatering of trees, irrigation that is required to run
more than once per week for other vegetation shall be set separately from the
irrigation that is installed for watering trees.
5.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of trees should not be needed for trees unless a nutrient
deficiency has been observed and shall only occur after approved by the Tree

11

Last Revised 2/4/10

Advisory Board. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary, shall be
done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and landscaping
fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates are
calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root system of
tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory Board.
5.4 Insect and Disease Control. Tree species that are resistant to insects and
diseases should be selected for plantings. Frequent and thorough inspections
shall be made to determine when measures for the control of insects and
diseases shall be taken. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and disease
issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to ensure
proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in the place
of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be applied for
controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an Indiana Licensed
Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct supervision of a
licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer, as per the
regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.
5.5 Pruning. Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead, broken, or
injured branches, water sprouts, and the suppression of uneven growth that
affects form. Pruning shall be practiced as often thereafter as needed to assure
strong branch unions. Newly planted trees need not have lower branches
removed until they are well established, or unless the branches visually or
physically obstruct paved right-of-ways and signs. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.0 Established Tree Care.
6.1 Pruning and Removal. No topping of trees shall be permitted. All large,
established trees shall be pruned to a height of at least eight (8) feet above
sidewalks and twelve (12) feet above streets. All cuts shall be made with a saw
or pruner and only at the nodes or crotches. No stubs shall be left. No spurs or
climbing irons shall be used to climb trees, except when trees are to be removed
or during an emergency rescue. All dead branches shall be removed; branches
that cross or rub should be pruned to eliminate future problems. The stumps of
all removed trees shall be cut to at least six (6) inches below the ground level
where feasible. Stump grindings shall be hauled off, and the soil cavity shall be
filled with top soil, tamped, leveled and re-seeded. Pruning of public trees shall
follow ANSI standards or other accepted arboricultural standards.
6.2 Insect and Disease Control. Before chemicals are used to resolve pest and
disease issues, the specific tree species and pest shall be properly identified to
ensure proper control method and alternative controls should be considered in
the place of chemicals. If fungicides, herbicides or pesticides are required to be
applied for controlling disease, pests or weeds, they must be applied by an

12

Last Revised 2/4/10

Indiana Licensed Pesticide Applicator, or by an employee working under direct
supervision of a licensed applicator who is within direct contact of the employer,
as per the regulations set forth by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist.

6.3 Fertilization. Fertilization of trees should not be needed unless a nutrient
deficiency has been observed and shall only occur after approved by the Tree
Advisory Board. Fertilization of public trees shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Fertilization, if deemed necessary, shall be
done according to soil nutrient deficiencies, and current lawn and landscaping
fertilization shall be calculated, before fertilization mixes and a rates are
calculated. Only broadcast fertilization of wet or dry fertilizers over root system of
tree shall be accepted unless otherwise approved by the Tree Advisory Board.
6.4 Cabling and Bracing. As a general rule, cables should be located above the
crotch at a point approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the distance between the
crotch and tops of the branch ends. Rust-resistant cables, thimbles, and lags
should be used. The ends of a cable should be attached to hooks or eyes of lags
or bolts inserted near the ends of the branches; thimbles must be used in the eye
splice in each end of the cable. In no instance shall cable be wrapped around a
branch. All cabling and bracing practices shall follow ANSI standards or other
accepted arboricultural standards. Cabling and bracing shall only be performed
by a Certified Arborist.
7.0 Tree Protection.
7.1 Protection or Removal. In the circumstances where construction and utility
operations underground will affect the health of a tree, a determination will be
made considering the overall value of the tree. The criteria for determining a
value for a tree will be based on species, size, condition, location, cost of
preserving the tree, and urgency of work to be completed. A decision based on
this value will be made concerning the protection or removal of the tree in
question. This decision shall be made jointly by the Tree Advisory Board and the
City Engineer or appropriate city official.
7.2 Construction Zone. Existing trees in or near areas to be developed (construction
sites) shall be guarded with temporary fencing. Placement of the fence is to be
at a minimum distance of one and a half feet (1.5’) for each inch in trunk
diameter measured at breast height (4½ feet). All vehicles, construction
equipment, building materials, dirt, or other debris shall be kept outside of the
barrier.
7.3 Root Pruning. When large roots are to be cut during trenching or grading, pruning
of roots must be done with the proper pruning equipment. Clean, flush, smooth
cuts shall be made on tree roots.

13

Last Revised 2/4/10

7.4 Underground Utilities. All installations of underground utilities upon public
property, which may conflict with tree roots, are subject to the review and the
approval of the Tree Advisory Board before the project starts. All installations
through tree drip-line areas should follow approved tunneling methods.

Vacant & Abandoned Initiative: Policy and Criteria for Modification of Demolition Orders
Properties on the City of South Bend’s demolition list have been deemed by a neutral hearing officer to
be uninhabitable and unsafe to occupy. As a matter of policy, the City will not rescind an order to
demolish once a hearing officer affirms the order. 1 The City strongly discourages people from
purchasing properties with affirmed demolition orders. However, the City may rescind a demolition
order (but is not required to) and convert the order to a repair agreement only when an individual (the
“petitioner”):
·
·
·

Has purchased the property in question;
Can demonstrate due diligence in the purchase of the property; and
Can demonstrate the financial resources to address all outstanding code violations.

Before the City will modify a demolition order to a repair agreement, the petitioner:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Must own the property;
Possess a recorded deed;2
Perform due diligence when purchasing the property;3
Demonstrate the financial ability to perform all of the repairs required by the Department of
Code Enforcement;4
5. Pay administrative fees and processing costs related to the demolition order;
6. Post a bond for demolition costs;5 and
7. Agree to complete all repairs within a date specified by the Department of Code Enforcement.6

1

Procedurally, the Department of Code Enforcement issues a demolition order. Then, that order must be affirmed
by the hearing officer.
2
Properties that have been purchased at tax sales and commissioners’ sales are subject to the same criteria and
prohibitions set forth in this document, aside from owning the property and possessing a recorded deed.
3
If the petitioner was unaware of the demolition order at the time of purchase, he or she must demonstrate that
he or she made every effort to contact the applicable City and St. Joseph County offices including, the City’s
Department of Code Enforcement and the County Assessor’s office. He or she may also have consulted various
City and County websites. For example, the list of properties that have affirmed demolition orders is posted on the
City of South Bend’s website: (http://southbendin.gov/government/content/vacant-abandoned-propertiesinitiative). Examples of appropriate documentation include the date and time the petitioner visited the applicable
offices and the name of employee(s) with whom the petitioner conversed.
4
Proof of financial ability may include a loan pre-approval or a financial statement.
5
In the event the petitioner fails to meet the terms of the repair agreement, he or she will forfeit his or her bond.
If the petitioner completes the work within the timeframe specified by the Department of Code Enforcement, the
bond will be released.
6
The City has the final authority on whether to rescind a demolition order. Notwithstanding the above, the City
may require a petitioner to submit additional information.

In addition, the petitioner must not:
1. Own property on the City’s Vacant & Abandoned List;
2. Own property with an outstanding code violation;
3. Have negative history associated with repairs, violations, or complaints on file with the
Department of Code Enforcement; or
4. Have past or current affiliation or association with any individual, group, organization, company,
or entity (collectively, “entity”) that has managed, owned, or had pecuniary, business, or similar
interest in any entity that has a property on the City’s Vacant & Abandoned List or property with
a history associated with repairs, violations, or complaints on file with the Department of Code
Enforcement.
In the event a non-owner occupant of a property (i.e. a renter/tenant) learns that the property in which
he or she resides has an affirmed demolition order, the City may provide the non-owner occupant with a
list of potential resources/services that may assist the non-owner occupant.

W. 16TH AVENUE VALVE REPLACEMENT
MAY 3, 2012

I work with Robert Pena who gave me your contact information to request the following closer. Please
contact me with any questions. My contact information is below.
I am looking to replace 2‐ 16”water main valves on west 16th Avenue between Broadway and Madison
Street. I would like to close the road to accomplish this task for two days, as followed 5/17 (Thursday) to
prep and excavate the valves and 5/18 to shot down the water system and actually replace both valves
in one evening.
I have been in contact with Linden House and the YMCA, two outfits that will be affected by the water
shut down on 5/18 (Friday). They have agreed to shut down between the hours of 4:30p.m. and 12
midnight to replace the valves. I will confirm the date with the businesses once the City officials agree to
the same accommodation and work schedule.
Please advise what I will need to do in order to proceed with this task
Mr. President, I move that we approve the request to close the road west 16th Ave. between Broadway
and Madison.

The attached change order No. 3 is being submitted by the construction inspector, Northwest
Engineering, on behalf of the contractor, Grimmer Construction. As noted in the attached Change Order,
the contractor struck a sanitary 10’ Dip Force Main that was not marked or located thereby resulting in
this change order. Therefore, I respectfully ask that the Board approve Change Order No. 3 in the
amount of $4834.36. The local share is $966.97 or 20% which will be picked up by GSD.

CHANGE ORDER NO. 4 FOR THE EAST RIDGE ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

The attached change order is being submitted by the Construction Inspector, Northwest Engineering, on
behalf of the contractor. As noted, this change order is to remove and replace the sewer manhole. This
change will result in an increase in the amount of the contract by $3685.38. INDOT will cover 80% of this
cost but the remaining $737.08 will be paid by the Gary Sanitary District. This unforeseen occurrence is
reflected in the attached documents.
If you should have any questions, please contact this office.

CHANGE ORDERS 3 AND 4
MAY 4, 2012

Mr. Sam Shapira advised me that the Board deferred action on the above change orders as the Board
has stated that they would like a letter from INDOT stating that INDOT will fund 80% of the above
change order costs.
INDOT manages a Site Manager Computer Program which requires us to post change order requests in
order to receive approval from INDOT. Before we can even present the change orders to the Board,
INDOT has to approve the change order on the Site Manager Program. Enclosed is a copy of the email
from Jim Kaur, INDOT Area Engineer, approving change orders No. 3 & 4.
INDOT has set aside $6,759,492 of Federal Funds for this project. Since the bid amount came in at
$5,583,750.72, the Federal Share is $4,467,000.00, so there is a substantial amount of funds left for
construction engineering and contingencies such as change orders.
I hope this satisfies your concerns. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact our office.
Several emails are attached…A check is attached from GSD in the amount of $1703.75
Mr. President, I move like to move that we approve Change Orders No. 3 and No. 4 for Grimmer

Please be advised that Alex Semchuck and AJS3K Productions of East Chicago, Indiana are seeking to film
portions of a documentary entitled “Stagnant Hope‐ Gary, Indiana” at various locations around the city
including Union Station, located at 3rd Avenue and Broadway; Memorial Auditorium, located at 7th
Avenue and Massachusetts Street, Gary; and Screw and Bolt, located at 901 Alabama Street; City
Methodist Church, located at 6th Avenue and Washington Street; the Palace Theatre, located at 8th and
Broadway; the Parry‐ Shaw Building; and the Sheraton Hotel. If approved by the Board of Public Works
and Safety, filming will take place on Saturday, May 12, 2012 between the hours of 8:00am and
4:30p.m.
Film production will involve a crew of people and will not impede traffic or cause any sound or lighting
disturbances. No street closures or special city services are required.
Please find attached proof of insurance and a hold harmless agreement protecting the City of Gary from
any risks associated with this project. I respectfully ask that this request to film be placed on the Board
of Works agenda for Wednesday, May 9, 2012.
Thank you for your consideration.

LETTER OF INTENT
My proposed documentary film, tentatively titled Stagnant Hop‐ Gary, Indiana, will focus on the past,
present, and future of the City of Gary.
The documentary will tell the story of the City, its triumphs it has had and its downfalls it has faced. The
film will also look at proposals to benefit Gary and what has been done up to this point. The goal of this
film is to tell the complete story of Gary. I have found that many people have the typical negative
stereotypes of Gary; but few of them have ever spent time in the City or have attempted to understand
the situation the City is facing. By filming in the City, I plan to spend enough time in Gary to tell the story
and hopefully shed some light on it.
In order to illustrate the current state of Gary, I will need footage of the City. This will primarily include
the outsides of the buildings; but I would also like footage from inside some of Gary’s most notable
abandoned structures. The current state of Gary is visible in their ruins. The abandoned sites I plan to
feature in the film, and would like to gain access to [include the aforementioned structures on the front
page]…
My crew will include a total of myself and 2 or 3 additional videographers and photographers. We will
not be using tripods, cranes, or any other equipment that could cause harm to ourselves or the buildings
we will be entering, or cause inconvenience to the people of Gary.
Through my research, I have come across hundreds of photographs and hours of film footage of modern
day Gary, some of which I plan to feature in the film. These include photos of several of Gary’s
abandoned schools, including Horace Mann High School, Edison Middle School, the original Emerson
High School, and Ambridge Elementary School. I will not need to gain access to these particular
buildings.
I would also like to include footage from other parts of the City as well, including:
• Gateway Park and City Hall (outside)
• 2300 Jackson Street (outside)
• Gary/ Chicago Airport…
The hold harmless agreement and insurance form are attached.
Mr. President, I move that we approve the request to film in Gary.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BUTTIGIEG: WE CANNOT AFFORD FURTHER DELAY ON WATER FUNDING After more than a
year of public conversation about the City’s water capital needs and several
months of debate on legislative solutions, Mayor Pete Buttigieg issued the
following statement today regarding water funding: “Delivering safe, clean
drinking water is one of our most fundamental obligations to the residents we
serve. I have confidence that the Council, as the established fiscal body, is
prepared to make good on that obligation. We cannot afford further delay on
critical funding for needed repairs to our water infrastructure. After months
of dialogue with the Council, we presented a compromise proposal nearly three
weeks ago that covers only the most urgent needs for the near term, and the
time for action has come.” Substitute Bill No. 66-16 adjusts the City’s
water rates on a phased basis and would increase the average household monthly
bill by $3.20 in 2018 and by an additional $3.78 in 2019. This corresponds with
a 3.9% increase of a typical household’s total city utility bill in 2018 and
an additional 4.5% increase in 2019.

Minutes for Richmond Environmental Sustainability Commission Meeting  8/19/15
Members present: Dave Brown, Yelitza Garcia, Scott Hess, Melanie Lennon, Kevin McCurdy, Ashley Schultz, Alison Zajdel, and community members Curtis Healton and Elijah Welch.
The meeting began at 8:35 am.
We engaged in overall planning and strategic visioning for the coming year, as well as discussing the overall optimal functioning of the Commission.
We discussed the desirability of Richmond becoming a single-stream recycling facility.  Making this transition would involve multiple changes, not only in buying the single-stream recycling equipment but in acquiring land to house it, new recycling trucks, etc.  A big project such as this one would require long-term planning and preliminary studies.  Richmond is unlikely to make major improvements in recycling without single-stream capabilities.
Melanie talked about CARE, an EPA program that funds community clean-up projects and might be useful to us.  We discussed ways in which he might coordinate salvage efforts for blighted properties, such as helping to develop a regular policy in relation to various stakeholders. We might work with the Unsafe Buildings Commission in this area.
In terms of overall function, the Commission is likely be more effective in gathering information, coordinating efforts of various groups, and doing education outreach than in trying to implement significant projects on our own.  We don't have the resources, in time or money, to implement significant actions ourselves, but we can be effective in spearheading initiatives and bringing various stakeholders and actors to the table on issues.  Meeting only once a month makes it difficult for us to move forward on issues without more regular follow-up.  We agreed to try the strategy of setting up subcommittees of people to work on specific issues and report back to the Commission, to allow us to make more progress in projects.  Forming ad hoc, task-based subcommittees to address specific issues as they arise seems like the best way to proceed, rather than adopting regular standing subcommittees.  
We discussed the possibility of holding more regular community summits, to help set our priorities and develop relationships across the community.  Yearly summits are probably too ambitious, since they don't give us enough time to make progress on initiatives before the next summit meeting.  Rather than having a set, regular schedule for summits, we might hold them when we finish each specific cycle of initiatives.  We could also use a summit -- or website, or other means of communication -- to present the issues we are currently working on to the public and solicit help.  In addition, we could use press releases, social media, and flyer distribution to invite participants and ideas.
We decided to set up an industrial waste exchange subcommittee, consisting of Alison, Curtis, and Melanie, to work towards progress in this area and report back next meeting.  We will also return to the salvage idea next meeting (Joe Hellrung might be a good coordinator for this effort).  We then brainstormed other area for possible action.  Ashley suggested bicycling accessibility.  Kevin suggested development of green incentives or some sort of review or recommendation process for sustainable building.  What kind of environmental planning review processes are currently in place with the city?  We will continue to generate ideas for possible initiatives in our next meeting. 
We approved the July Commission minutes.  We decided to nominate Curtis Healton for official Commission membership, to replace Darryl Decker for the remainder of his term, since Darryl has resigned.  Ashley will bring that recommendation to the Mayor's office in hopes of moving it forward. 
The meeting adjourned at 9:45 am.

METROPOLITIAN & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Metropolitan and Economic Development Committee of the City-County Council met on
Monday, August 5, 2013. Chairman Leroy Robinson called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m.
with the following members present: John Barth, Ginny Cain, Will Gooden, Jeff Miller and Vop
Osilli. Zach Adamson and Mary Moriarty Adams were absent.
PROPOSAL NO. 189, 2013 - reappoints Wayne Schmidt to the Indianapolis City Market
Corporation Board of Directors
Mr. Schmidt stated that he is the Chief Financial Officer (CEO) and Principal of Schmidt
Associates. He is a native of Evansville, Indiana, a graduate of the University of Illinois and a
certified facilitator of strategic planning. Mr. Schmidt said that downtown is important, as well as
the City Market. He has served as President of the Market for about eight years. Every stand
except for one is filled, and the goal is to add five more stands in the balcony.
Chair Robinson asked if the Indy Bike Hub and the YMCA are successful. Mr. Schmidt
answered in the affirmative, stating that there are over 300 members who use the facility. He
said that it has been hugely successful. The west wing of the Market is equally successful,
because LISC has taken that portion of the Market. He said that the Tomlinson Tap Room in the
balcony of the Market is profitable, but it will take some time for people to get used to going
there.
Councillor Gooden moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to send Proposal No. 189, 2013 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass“recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0
PROPOSAL NO. 191, 2013 - reappoints Nora Spitznogle to the Indianapolis City Market
Corporation Board of Directors
Ms. Spitznogle is the Director of Programs for Second Helpings, which is a food rescue, job
training and hunger relief agency. She said that she was also a tenant in the Market for eight
years. Ms. Spitznogle said that the Market is so different from 18 years ago, and she loves
seeing where it is going. She said that she brings to the appointment a non-profit perspective, in
terms of accounting, and the perspective of wanting to have a vital Market and employing
people. Chair Robinson asked when Ms. Spitznogle started her appointment. Ms. Spitznogle
stated that it was two years ago.
Councillor Barth thanked Ms. Spitznogle for her willingness to serve and said he has known her
for a long time. Councillor Barth asked Ms. Spitznogle if she had any comments on the time she
had a booth in the Market and now. Ms. Spitznogle said that she wishes this time was that time
during her work at the Market. She said that the Market was in disarray, even in a way that all of
the tenants were fighting for the same slice of the pie and there was a lot of discord among
everyone; it was not a happy place. Ms. Spitznogle said that now, the Market has such a
different attitude when you walk in the door. She loves seeing all of the vendors working
together in promoting events or other vendors.
Councillor Barth moved, seconded by Councillor Gooden, to send Proposal No. 191, 2013 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass“recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 192, 2013 - reappoints David Hampton to the Indianapolis City Market
Corporation Board of Directors
Mr. Hampton stated that since coming back to Indianapolis, he has been very impressed with
the growth of the City, downtown and the City Market. He said that he is excited to be a part of
the newness of the Market. Mr. Hampton stated that he was appointed late in December 2012,
and that appointment expired. He said that it is an honor to be reappointed, so that he can
really engage like he wants and this will give him that opportunity.
Councillor Osili stated that he is glad to have Mr. Hampton back in the community and part of
the City Market board. He encourages his fellow committee members to support this proposal.
Councillor Osili moved, seconded by Councillor Barth, to send Proposal No. 192, 2013 to the full
Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 231, 2013 - approves the statement of benefits for Reflex & Allen USA, an
applicant for tax abatement for property located in an economic revitalization area
Ryan Hunt, Senior Project Manager, Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), stated
that DMD is seeking approval for the statement of benefits for a personal property tax
abatement for Reflex & Allen USA, located at 2655 Fortune Circle West, Indianapolis, IN 46241.
Mr. Hunt stated that by State Statute, the Council is to approve a statement of benefits, which is
the summary of investment and jobs that would result from the project, as part of the tax
abatement when it is within a designated TIF district, and Reflex & Allen is located within the
Airport TIF district. Mr. Hunt stated that this is a four-year personal property tax abatement, with
$1.5 million in manufacturing equipment and would result in 48 new jobs through 2017.
Robert Bradley, Financial Controller, Reflex & Allen, USA, made a brief presentation, attached
as Exhibit A. Following are a few key points:






The Reflex & Allen Group was formed in 2009 by the merger of two companies; The
Reflex Group and The Allen Group
Established in January 2012
Current employees are 38
Capacity of 15 shifts per week
Products: tubing, air brake coils, formed parts, and electric coils

Councillor Osili asked if they have any current idea of how many Marion County residents are
employed at Reflex & Allen and what they anticipate. Councillor Osili also asked if they will
make any efforts to encourage employees to live in Marion County. Mr. Bradley stated that the
plan is to begin working with Work Force One to bring in people from Marion County. He said
that when they started their operation, almost all of the employees were Marion County
residents, but they had a lot of turnovers. Mr. Bradley stated that they needed employees
quickly, so they went to temp agencies. They fulfilled contracts with temp agencies and then
hired the employees. Mr. Bradley stated that they have not had luck hiring employees straight
out. Councillor Osili asked what the process is that Work Force One will follow to look for Marion
County residents. Mr. Bradley stated that they would have to have a set-up meeting with Work
Force One, where they will determine what Reflex is looking for in employees. He said that
Work Force One will screen them and submit the names for them to interview. Councillor Osili

Metropolitan & Economic Development Committee
August 5, 2013
Page 3
asked if Reflex & Allen will look for Marion County residents to be employed there. Mr. Bradley
answered in the affirmative.
Chair Robinson asked how many employees are Marion County residents. Mr. Bradley said that
there are between 12 and 14.
Councillor Osili asked if they can have some level of affirmation that Reflex & Allen will hire
Marion County residents. Councillor Osili asked Mr. Hunt what the commitment is for the 48 new
jobs. Mr. Hunt stated that the standard commitment is through 2017 and to hire about 10 per
year. He said that it will be a 95% compliance factor, as long as they reach that goal.
Councillor Gooden asked if this property is within the boundaries of the TIF allocation area. Mr.
Hunt said that is correct. Councillor Gooden asked if this area is already an Economic
Revitalization Area. Mr. Hunt answered in the affirmative. Councillor Gooden asked if it was just
physical designating the location. Mr. Hunt said that is correct. He said that most abatements
are site-specific. Councillor Gooden asked if there was a specific period for the abatement. Mr.
Hunt answered in the affirmative, stating that DMD is allowing Reflex & Allen to have the
abatement through the end of the tax year, which is February 28, 2014.
Councillor Barth asked what the overall value of the abatement is. Mr. Hunt said that DMD has
estimated over the four-year period, taxpayers will have saved over $51,600 on the new
investment. Councillor Barth stated that the Indiana Economic Development Groups will provide
up to a half a million dollars in tax credits and another $28,000 in training grants. Mr. Hunt
stated that he believes that relates to the 2012 initial location on which the City did not offer
incentives on. Mr. Bradley said that initially when the company came to the location, the State
offered a tax abatement; as well as one from Marion County. He said that the paper work was
completed for the State, but the timeliness of the paperwork was not completed for the City
portion. He said that when this project came up, they did not go back to the State; they just
stuck with the City, since they offered the investment in the first place. Councillor Barth stated
that the previous investment by the State was up to a half million dollars and now it is a much
lower amount. Mr. Bradley said that was not for personal property, it was on their total state
return.
Chair Robinson asked when DMD submitted the information on Reflex & Allen to the Council
office. Mr. Hunt said that they submitted their summary with the tax information to the Council
office about a week after it was introduced.
Councillor Miller asked if the $1.5 million is not a burn to the taxpayers, if it is just a portion of
that amount. Mr. Hunt said that the $1.5 million is an investment to Reflex & Allen. DMD only
taxes the assessed value of that, and the abatement applies to whatever the assessed value is.
Councillor Miller stated that no where written is the burn that the taxpayers will burden.
Councillor Miller stated that the reason this is only for one year is because Reflex & Allen will
buy the equipment and save the money. Mr. Hunt said that they will save that over four years
and will pay approximately $27,000 to the tax rolls. Councillor Miller asked how they will do that.
Mr. Hunt said in their normal personal property tax payments in the Spring and Fall. Councillor
Miller stated that the average salary will be about $31,175. Mr. Hunt said that should be correct.

Metropolitan & Economic Development Committee

Chair Robinson said that this committee is in a difficult position where they do not have the
numbers to look at. The presentation was great, but to approve abatements without numbers
proves rather difficult.
Councillor Barth asked Mr. Bradley to discuss his comments about the challenge of attracting
and retaining employees, while having a $28,000 training grant. He asked why it is challenging
and what the intent is of the training grant. Mr. Bradley stated that the major portion of the
$28,000 is going towards hiring an extruding operator. He said that they are having four highend engineers to run the machines, so they are seeking employees that are looking to make
$100,000 to do that. Mr. Bradley said that the rest of the training will be on the TS16949 and the
ISO 14001.
Councillor Miller asked if this proposal will come back to the committee for approval after the
Metropolitan Development Commission (MDC) approves it or if it is just saying that, to the
Council’s knowledge, the information they submitted on their statement of benefits looks right.
Mr. Hunt said that is correct. He said that the MDC is always the designating body for
establishing the Economic Revitalization Area designation, as well as the terms of the
abatement. Councillor Miller asked if they are approving that the numbers typed on the
statement are correct or approving the amount of money. Mr. Hunt said this is the State’s
statement of benefits form referenced in the Statute. Councillor Miller asked where the
information is listed regarding the amount of jobs, how much will they be paid and what the
investment is to the taxpayers. Mr. Hunt said that information is located on the staff analysis
form that has been passed out to the committee.
Councillor Barth moved, seconded by Councillor Osili, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 231, 2013, to
a date certain.
Councillor Miller asked if there is a hardship to Reflex & Allen if this proposal is postponed. Mr.
Bradley answered in the negative, stating that there is a timeliness with the equipment arriving,
and they have some engineers coming into Indianapolis.
The motion to postpone failed by a vote of 3-3, with Councillors Cain, Gooden and Miller casting
the negative votes.
Councillor Cain moved, seconded by Councillor Osili, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 231, 2013, to
August 19, 2013, before the regular Council meeting for a vote. The motion carried by a vote of
6-0.
Councillor Miller asked if there would be another form that will go before the MDC, because he
would like to see it. Mr. Hunt said that there will be a final resolution published on the next
MDC’s agenda.
Chair Robinson asked when the equipment will be installed. Mr. Bradley stated that the
equipment is currently in flight. The actual installation of the equipment is within a few weeks,
full production is to begin October 1, 2013.
{Clerk’s Note: This meeting was scheduled to occur August 14, 2013 at 5:30 p.m. instead of
August 19, 2013, per committee Chair.}

Project Updates:
The following updates provided by Jamison Hutchins:
•

•
•

29th/30th Streets connection of White River and Canal Trails is finished
Prospect Street from Fountain Square to State is nearly finished. Part of the project requires
removing parking from the south side of the street. Parking removal requires City Council
action; when the project started there was good support for this, but it is currently lukewarm.
Keystone at Pleasant Run is completed.
East Street from the interstate to Garfield Park will just get Sharrows. The neighborhood will
not give up parking at this point.
Pogue’s Run Greenway is at preliminary plan stage. We should get to review this.
A separated one-way southbound cycle track on Pennsylvania from St. Clair to Washington
Street is planned. It will run down the west side of the street, with a painted area or parking
lane buffer. It will connect to the New York and Michigan bike lanes, and to the Cultural Trail at
North and Washington Streets. There is a companion northbound lane is planned on Delaware
Street.
Separated one-way bike lanes are planned on New York and Michigan between College and
Rural as part of the Green Lanes Project. The project is just starting.
Lafayette Road over CSX Bridge will close shortly. There is a bike detour planned. Mark and
Jamison will find out about route and duration.
A large project on New York and Michigan through IUPUI was announced. The streets will be
reconstructed to accommodate two-way traffic, bikes and pedestrians. It will probably be
constructed in 2015 and 2016.

Presentation of Eskenazi Health Bicycle Plans: Michael Kaufmann reported.

•
•
•
•
•

Bike racks have been installed at all of the clinics and there are two Fixtations on the campus.
A wellness trail will run across the campus from Michigan to 10th Streets. It should be
announced at the end of July 2014.
The School of Medicine and Eskenazi Health are working with ICT, Inc to sponsor a Pacers
Bikeshare station.
They are working to copy Boston’s Prescribe-a-Bike program. This provides bikeshare
memberships to patients.
They plan to be a 2015 Bicycle Friendly Business; actually the best in the world.

Update on Commuter Task Force: Karen Doe, Senior Program Director for the Downtown YMCA
reported for the task force.
• The Bike Hub is making more intentional efforts to attract bike commuters to use the facility.
• They have used a CIBA grant of $2K to purchase a SARIS hub tracking system. The system uses a
card reader to record usage. We wondered if the system tracks where the commuters have
come from or only where they have ended up.
• IndyGO sponsored a Dump the Pup event on the Circle
• They intend to apply for a Sustain Indy Community Grant. This grant may be used for big picture
education and to develop bike trains. Bike trains seem like a natural evolution, but apparently
are not wide spread; Connie reported that Los Angeles has fewer than 10. Bike to Work Day
organized start locations should be natural train beginnings, as would IndyCog Park + Pedals.
We discussed commuter mentors, or train conductors. Carole Terry and Joan Cook are part of a
group that rides in Lafayette Road on Fridays, and Carole would lead that as a train.
Overview of the Connection Our City Training (Alliance for Biking and Walking, in conjunction with the
San Francisco Bicycle Coalition and the Green Lane Project): Ed Fujawa, IndyCog Board of Directors
reported on the training,
• The event was in San Francisco with intense workshops.
• There were advocacy workshops that covered training and strategy.
• There was Green Lane training.
• There was a training exercise to help communities map out funding and partnering strategies.
• There was emphasis on connections for bike infrastructure. How to get riders 8 to 80 on the
road.
• There was discussion on bike infrastructure advocacy during planning phases and at public
meetings. Ambassadors to the neighborhoods are used.
• Ed has conference notes and handouts that he will share with IMBAC.
Committee Updates:
Education/Encouragement: Scott Manning reported on the current Know Zone efforts. There is a public
education and outreach effort ongoing. Sustain Indy will have a new website in the next week or so.
Trendy Minds is helping with material efforts. There are radio ads, online ads, bill boards, and a video
program.
Engineering: No update at the present time
Equity/Evaluation: There appears to be approval of a student intern through SPEA at IUPUI

Enforcement: The extensions of Greenway hours are up for approval again. This would apply to all
greenways, not just the Monon.
National Bike Challenge Update:
There are currently 823 people registered, 550 of whom are logging miles. Last year there were only
152 people participating. We have 225K miles logged and 2½ months to go.
Recap of Past Events:
• World Bicycle Relief. Frank Merritt reported a successful event. There were Sram tours, Sun
King Beer, and 913 Sports. $23K was raised, which will send 300 bikes to Africa.

Home &gt; FORUM TO DISCUSS VACANT AND ABANDONED PROPERTIES IN SOUTH BEND
===============================================================================
***** FORUM_TO_DISCUSS_VACANT_AND_ABANDONED_PROPERTIES_IN_SOUTH_BEND [1] *****

Mayor Pete Buttigieg will discuss South Bend’s strategy to address vacant and
abandoned properties at an Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority
(IHCDA) public forum on Wednesday, December 4 at 6:00 pm at the St._Joseph
County_Public_Library [2], 304 S. Main Street.
The event will also feature State Senators Joe Zakas, R-Granger, and Jim
Merritt, R-Indianapolis. Indiana was recently awarded $221 million under the
Hardest Hit Fund, a national initiative established by the U.S. Treasury
Department. The program gives states the ability to develop solutions to
address its vacant and abandoned properties. IHCDA has been hosting a series of
public forums throughout the state to discuss solutions.
“South Bend welcomes the state’s involvement to help us address our vacant
and abandoned properties,” says Mayor Pete Buttigieg. “Public input is also
essential to help up develop the most efficient use of resources toward home
rehabilitation, land reuse, or demolition.”
Addressing vacant and abandoned properties remains a top priority for the
administration. In February 2013, Mayor Buttigieg released a Vacant_&amp;
Abandoned_Properties_Task_Force_Report [3] and called for 1,000 abandoned homes
to be addressed in 1,000 days. The 2014 City budget allocates more than $2
million toward the initiative.
“Abandoned and longtime vacant properties are a significant challenge across
Indiana,” says Andy Fraizer, Executive Director of the Indiana Association
for Community Economic Development. “Indiana’s Hardest Hit Fund program
should follow the lead of local communities, such as South Bend and others, who
best know how to deploy resources with various community development strategies
including rehabilitation and demolition.”
