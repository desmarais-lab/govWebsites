HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
2013 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT

FOR
THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT
& EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT

THE ST. JOSEPH COUNTY HOUSING CONSORTIUM - HOME PROGRAM

CR-05 - Goals and Outcomes
Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan.

91.520(a)
This could be an overview that includes major initiatives and highlights that were proposed and
executed throughout the program year.

In South Bend during 2013, a total of 91 households received help with housing issues: 77 were existing
homeowners assisted with repairs, and 14 were potential homebuyers provided homebuyer
education. Low-moderate income homeowners received assistance with needed repairs through the
following programs: SBHIP- 35 assisted; REAL Services' Caregiver Connection- 24 assisted; Rebuilding
Together - 18 assisted.
The Community Homebuyers Corporation {CHC) assisted 13 households and Housing Development
Corporation's {HOC) REWARD program helped five households in the City of South Bend with the
purchase oftheir first home. CHC and REWARD served the same four clients, for a net beneficiary
number of fourteen.
In addition, the City of South Bend supports neighborhood revitalization efforts through four major
partners: two community development corporations - South Bend Heritage Foundation (SBHF) and the
Near Northwest Neighborhood, Inc. {NNN)- as well as the Northeast Neighborhood Revitalization
Organization {NNRO) and Habitat for Humanity of St. Joseph County.
SBHF has developed affordable housing for the residents of South Bend for the past 40 years. SBHF is
currently focusing its planning and rehabilitation efforts in the Near West Side of South Bend. Working
with CDBG, HOME and private funds, they have made a significant difference in the revitalization ofthat
area . In 2013 two {2) properties with substandard structures were acquired by SBHF. One was
demolished, providing a cleared lot for future home construction. The other property contains two
historic homes that a previous owner joined together via a third structure. SBHF demolished the joining
structure, will sell one of the historic homes to Indiana Landmarks for use as a model home to
demonstrate renovation techniques, and SBHF will rehab the other house for resale to an incomeeligible household.
The NNRO was formed in 2000 to strengthen and revitalize South Bend's Northeast Neighborhood. The
NNRO continues to work with the University of Notre Dame on the development of Eddy Street
Commons, a mixed use development containing commercial space, hotels, conference center and mixed
income condominium and single-family homes. Thirty percent of the single family homes are set aside
for low-mod income families. In 2013 three low-mod homebuyers received mortgage assistance
through the NNRO's Mortgage Investment Program, funded with HOME dollars. The City targeted its
NSP3 funding to the northeast neighborhood, contracting with the NNRO for the construction of five {5)
single-family homes. The homes were completed in September 2013; one home sold in 2013 and the

remaining four are listed for sale. Additional NSP3 funds were allocated for construction of permanent
rental special needs housing. Construction was completed in September 2013 and the home now
houses four special-needs tenants.
The NNN has been improving the quality of life in the Near Northwest Neighborhood for the past 20
years. Using a combination of CDBG and HOME, the NNN is focusing efforts on the Cottage GroveLindsey Street area. The NNN purchased three vacant homes in 2013: one was demolished; one was
rehabbed and sold to an income-el igible household; and one w ill be used for future rehab. In addition,
the NNN completed renovation of the space adjacent to their offices for a community center in October
2013. The space has been used for numerous community events.
Habitat for Humanity continues to be a strong player in the affordable housing market, building new
homes for their partner familie s. Funding through HOME will subsidize the construction of up to four (4)
new homes rn South Bend in 2014.

Assess how the jurisdiction's use of funds, particularly CDBG, addresses the priorities and
specific objectives identified in the plan, giving special attention to the highest priority
activities identified.
During the 2013 program year, year four of the 5-year plan, the City of South Bend and the St. Joseph
County Housing Consortium effectively used their Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME,
Shelter Plus Care (SPC), and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds to undertake a variety of programs,
projects and activities designed to address housing and community development needs throughout the
City of South Bend and St. Joseph County. Priority initiatives included housing rehabilitation,
homebuyer assistance, neighborhood and public facility improvements, provision of public services, and
affordable housing development. The accomplishments of the City of South Bend and the St. Joseph
County Housing Consortium were consistent with the consolidated Plan's high-priority community
development and housing objectives, and are presented in this report.
PLEASE NOTE: HUD did not release 2013 funds until mid-August 2013, therefore the City of South Bend
and St. Joseph County Housing Consortium were not able to contract with subgrantees until September
2013. Th is left insufficient time in which to start, let alone complete, most 2013 CDBG, HOME and ESG
activities.

Based on data received from HUD for the NSP1 and NSP3 programs, the areas of greatest need in the
City of South Bend were identified as census tracts 6, 4, 21, and 5, two of which are located in the Near
Northwest and Near West Side neighborhoods. The City also identified census tracts 19 and 20 as
areas of greatest need based on the data and the foreseen likelihood of foreclosures.
Additionally, the geographic allocation of resources was based upon:

History of the City's focus/redevelopment and support of Community
Development Corporations (CDCs)

â¢

Areas of need per NSP determinations

â¢

Location of most vacant and abandoned structures

Given recent changes in the economy, the need for homeowner assistance has peaked. To that end,
2013 HOME funds allocated to the County were directed to construction of a new 10-unit rental project
for senior citizens in North Liberty.

leveraging
Explain how federal funds leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds),
including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any
publicly owned land o r property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the
needs identified in the plan.

ESG match dollars come from a variety of sources including private donations, volunteer labor, and
United Way grants. HOME match dollars come from private donations, volunteer labor, land donations
and waived fees/taxes.
In 2013 the City of South Bend's Commun ity Homebuyers Corporation (CHC) awarded $109,399 of CDBG
funds in Forgivable Mortgage Subsidy funds to nine (9} families, enabling them to become
homeowners. These subsidies were leveraged with $533,030 in private mortgage funding. CDBG
provides the mortgage subsidy of up to 20%, not to exceed $19,000 of the purchase price of a home,
and local lenders represented on the CHC board pool their funds to provide the remaining dollars. CHC
offers financing to clients that are usually not conventionally lendable. Pre- and post-purchase
counseling required for the mortgage subsidy program is a major contributing factor to its success.
Rebuilding Together (formerly known as Christmas in April} has aided homeowners in various
neighborhoods t hroughout the community since 1989. Rebuilding Together has built a strong
relationship with the City of South Bend, local trades, the higher education community and the business
community, allowing the program to grow stronge r and more efficient every year. In 2013 Rebuilding
Together comp leted home repairs for 18 households in the West Side - LaSalle Park neighborhood of
South Bend. Rebuilding Together was allocated $120,000 in CDBG funds and it is estimated that
donated labor added $78,900; donated materials an additional $7,467; and contractor discounts an
additiona l $6,231 to the project. The don ated labor, materials and contractor discounts have almost
doubled the benefit ofthe CDBG allocation.

Narrative Information
Programs continue to concentrate on providing decent affordable housing and a stable neighborhood
environment for low- to moderate-income people. With a number of housing assistance programs,
South Bend strives to help people in a variety of circumstances find decent, affordable housing whether their need is for small repair grants, rehab/repair, homebuyer counseling on credit, how to
work with a realtor and obtain a mortgage, down payment assistance or mortgage subsidies for existing
or new houses. In addition to the City's work, local CDCs continue to develop and build their own
capacity. Housing strategy and priorities have also been guided by the HCD plan; the Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area (NRSA) Plan; as well as the NSP1, NSP3 and CDBG-R amendments.
St. Joseph County- The Housing Assistance Office (HAO) coordinates most ofthe new and rehabilitation
projects for affordable housing in the county outside South Bend and Mishawaka. In 2013 The Housing
Assistance Office (HAO) began work on a new construction 10-unit senior housing rental project in
North Liberty. Construction is anticipated to be complete in May 2014, with full lease-up expected by
year end 2014.

CR-25- Homeless and Other Special Needs 91.220(d, e); 91.320(d, e); 91.520(c)
Evaluate the jurisdiction's progress in meeting its specific objectives for reducing and ending
homelessness through:
Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their
individual needs
The Continuum of Care (CoC) agencies have worked together to design and implement a co llaborative
process based on referrals and complementary programs and services. For the recent HPRP process, one
agency served as the single point of entry to provide financial assistance and make referrals to other
appropriate agency partners. The process included shelter housing, movement to current ESG or
Supportive Housing Programs (SHP) funded agency programs, and working with the CoC to ensure needs
are met appropriately per client. Case management services were available through four agencies to
regularly assess the needs of clients. One agency in particular serves returning prisoners who are
homeless. This effort continued with the ESG Rapid Re-housing activity in 2013.

Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons
The CoC continued to discuss and work on strategies that will result in the following priorities:
Restructuring the traditional shelter system toward the Housing First model and meeting Hearth
Act priorities.
Focusing on rapid re -housing activities with ESG.
Using two distinct approaches, one for situational impoverished homeless individuals and one for
the chronically impoverished homeless, to re-house them .
Reducing the unsheltered or precariously housed population
Reducing the time spent in transitional housing.

Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families
with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to
permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that
individuals and fam ilies experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals
and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were
recently homeless from becoming homeless again
The chronically homeless, severely mentally ill, veterans, persons with HIVI AIDS, victims of domestic
violence, and youth were moved into rapid re-housing options rather than the traditional shelter system

whenever possible; the chronic substance abuse homeless subpopulation used a traditional shelter
model with expanded services and programs. Pursuit of a large-scale permanent housing project for the
severely mentally ill is ongoing. The Center for the Homeless established a homeless veterans'
facility. The CoC is also considering a facility for the chronically homeless who typically stay outside of
the shelter system.

Helping low-income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely
low-income individuals and families and those who are: likely to become homeless after
being discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care
facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections
programs and institutions}; and, receiving assistance from public or private agencies that
address housing, health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs
Discharge planning within the community continues to be extremely difficult. While the hospitals and
community mental health centers have coordinated plans with the emergency shelter facilities, they are
still less than ideal for an individual just released from their care. Additionally, county and state
correctional facilities are not coordinating their releases; it is not uncommon to have an individual arrive
at a facility with paperwork ordering them into residence when there is no available bed. With the
support of the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, the CoC has been working with
the State Department of Correction and the Department of Child Services to improve the coordination
of discharge policies.
The CoC has developed discharge coordination policies for foster care, health care, and mental health
systems of care. Foster Care : The Indiana Division of Child Services case managers are responsible for
creating individualized plans for each youth being discharged from foster care. They are re sponsible for
case planning, and reunification conferences with providers including foster parents, birth parents,
children (when age appropriate), and Court Appointed Special Advocates. Discharge planning does not
include use of McKinney-Vente funded shelters. Youth aging out of foster care receive independent
living services that cover areas such as financial independence, educational needs, vocational needs,
mental health and substance abuse treatment. The Division of Child Services has a written protocol and
partners with appropriate community providers to ensure that youth discharged from foster care are
not discharged into the streets.

CR-30- Public Housing 91.220(h); 91.3200)
Actions taken to address the needs of public housing
The HASB has embraced the move by all PHAs to asset-based management of its properties and was
ahead of most in implementing these principles. In 2001, the HASB realized that one of its
developments (Northwest) was out of step with the single family home development in the adjacent
neighborhood. Due in part from the density of the development, Northwest was plagued by very low
occupancy rates. The HASB demolished 22 units and changed the appearance of the remaining 24 units
to reflect the change to single family homes in the area. Since the revitalization, occupancy is typically
100% and the remaining units have stabilized this neighborhood.
As a result of the demolition of the 22 units at Northwest, the HASB applied for and received
Replacement Housing Funds from HUD and committed to the purchase of single family homes. With the
decline in real estate values, the HASB was able to purchase properties in areas not previously accessible
and continues to expand the availability of public housing in all areas ofthe City. In 2010, the HASB
added three additional public housing scattered site units to its inventory and expects to double that
number in the near future.
In 2010 the HASB completed a HUD approved disposition of eight single-family public housing units in
exchange for an equal number of single family units in an area of redevelopment known as Eddy
Commons Development Area. This ensures that affordable housing options will remain in areas not
commonly associated with affordable housing.
During the past three years, the HASB has administered 52 HUD-VASH vouchers that help house
homeless veterans and expects to receive another 25 veterans into the program during the coming year.

Actions taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in
management and participate in homeownership
The local Housing Authority participates in the Family Self-Sufficiency Program {FSS). The FSS program is
a voluntary program for Section 8 participants. Additionally, for the past 11 years residents of public
housing have participated in a similar program that combines the Public Housing Authority Sec. 32
Program with an Indiana State program of Ind ividual Development Accounts {IDAs). The Section 8
Program requires that the head of household enter a five-year contract with the PHA during which time
the family will receive supportive services through a case worker with the goal of eventually not needing
public assistance of any type. In return, any rent increases from increased income earnings that the
participant experiences are placed in an interest bearing escrow account which the participant receives
when they complete their contract. This escrow account can be used for a down payment on a home or
educational or medical expenses. In the Public Housing Homeownership Program at the Housing
Authority of South Bend {HASB) (now referred to as Section 32), since it was begun and initially titled
Turnkey Ill, well over 100 families have moved from public housing to homeownership.

CR-35 - Other Actions 91.2200)-(k); 91.320{i)-0)
Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as
barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning
ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the
return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i)
In 2013 the St. Jose ph Housing Consortium continued efforts to expand the reach of the Human Rights
Commission to the city of Mishawaka and St. Joseph County. Support for the developments that would
improve employment prospects for low/mod income individuals was ongoing throughout the year.
People returning to the community from prison often need assistance in securing jobs and affordable
housing. The City of South Bend awarded 2013 ESG funds to Dismas House, an organization which
provides support and job referral services to ex-offenders.
The Residential Tax Abatement program was available to potential homeowners as an incentive for
homeownership. The program allowed a phasing-in of the costs that could lessen the immed iate
financial burden and, co upled with the legislated property tax cap, could be critical to new homeowners.
The City of South Bend continued its Housing Counseling and Home buyer Education programs. While
not a financia l mechanism, better education and increased understanding of the costs and risks of
homeownership can direct individuals to a situation best suits them. Understanding whether a home
purchase is a viable option is critical to making an inform ed decision.
Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Allocations aligned with the High Priorities listed in the 2010-2014 HCD Plan and emphasized
homeownership, public facility improvements, public improvements and technical assistance. These
remained the broader community priorities in 2013 based upon a number of issues:
Community need exceeded available resources
Slow economy I high unemployment depleted existing resources, while reducing donations
High rate of underemployment meant homeowners lacked income to maintain housing
High foreclosure rate was still a relevant issue
Large elderly population living in homes they could not maintain
Many issues including slow economy, unemployment, foreclosures can take a toll on a person's
emotional and mental health. These types of issues could be a contributing factor
to abuse, addiction and homelessness.

South Bend's neighborhood revitalization focus became more urgent in recent years with the onset of
the national housing crisis and the resulting number of vacant and abandoned homes. This situation,
coupled with an aging housing stock, created a challenging environment for neighborhoods and the
community. Complementary responses including public facility improvements, acquisition f
rehabilitation, and demolition were seen as necessary and critical to achieving revitalization and
assuring other investment, therefore resources were directed toward programs that addressed those
activities.
Another significant obstacle was the reduction of State funding and the lack of availability of State ESG
funding to agencies serving the most vulnerable in St. Joseph County. There are no other resources to
counter the reduction of these previously available funds. This can result in a reduction of staff which
hampers the ability to provide service at the level anticipated and/or desired. The limitation of short
term rental assistance dolla rs in the community as compared to the need was also a major obstacle. The
economy and state of unemployment created a greater challenge as services were sought by even more
individuals and fam ilies.

Actions taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
The Housing Authority of South Bend (HASB) in partnership with the Saint Joseph County Health
Department applied for and received a $3 million HUD Lead Hazard Control grant in 2006. The
community provided more than $1 million in matching and in-kind support towa rd this grant. Through
2010 the program completed 270 units and follow-up assessments continued through 2013. The
program goal of 189 homes was exceeded by 81 homes.
In 2012, the HASB, in partnership with the County Health Department and financial support from the
City, County Commissioners, County Health Department, the Community Foundation of St. Joseph
County, South Bend Med ical Foundation, and Residence Inn by Marriot again received a Lead Hazard
Control Grant. This grant will bring an additional $3.8 Million in resources to the County to combat the
relentless poisoning of children by lead hazards. As part of these resources, $180,000 will be used to
focus on a physical and holistic approach to several additional home toxins and safety hazards in what
HUD refers to as a Health Homes initiative. Over 250 homes are expected to have work done via the
grant. Outreach and training are expected to create more jobs by increasing the capacity of the certified
contractors in the County by over three times the current level. Over 60 personnel including 35 that
qualify as Section 3 eligible (low income) have received training and certifications in Lead Hazard
Abatement. In the near future the HASB plans to partner with local financial institutions to access the
NIP program in order to assist families by completing much needed repairs in addit ion to the Lead
Hazard Work.

Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty-level families. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Examples of the variety of mechanisms the community has employed to address poverty included the
Center for Homeless STAR (Skilled, Tra ined, Able, and Ready) program which incorporated job readiness,
CAPER
OMB Control No: 2506Â·0117 (exp. 07/ 31/2015)

21

externships, job retention, and job search assistance. Another program that assists poverty-level
families is Bridges Out of Poverty. Bridges Out of Poverty is a local program based on a nationally
recognized model that serves to educate both the low-income individual and the employer community
on how to work together to address issues that prevent people in poverty from becoming
employed . The Bridges classes were part of the City's Weed & Seed Program and targeted to the same
neighborhoods as the CDBG funding. The Apprenticeship Academy, a training program primarily
targeted to manufacturing but also including health certifications, closed its doors in May 2013.
The St. Joseph County community was further committed to implementation of the low income
employment provisions at 24CFR, Part 135 in the use of federal funds covered by Section 3. To that end,
the Section 3 clause was incorporated into each contract. All public works construction contracts using
such funds included Section 3 language as well. In addition, Section 3 requirements were outlined
during the pre-construction meeting for those projects.

Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Any targeted approach to a geography meshes the efforts of South Bend City departments, the CDCs,
and other nonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity to broadly plan and advance the effort. The HOME,
CDBG, CDBG-R and NSP funds targeted to the Near Westside, Near Northwest, and Northeast
Neighborhood offer an opportunity for all of these entities to work together using their various areas of
expertise and educating each on opportunities and challenges that will support the successful
conclusion of the plan. South Bend utilized a team approach to working with its partners in
implementing the programs/projects funded through the various federal sources. The Community
Development staff regularly communicated with all sub-grantees, and met with those entities involved
in the targeted areas. Regularly scheduled meetings with CDCs occured due to the nature of work and
amount of funds allocated.
Staff met with an entity upon approval of a project and prior to contracting. In addition, desktop and
on-site monitoring occured regularly throughout the year.
St. Joseph County Housing Consortium members were continually informed of project/program status at
their meetings throughout the year. Scheduled early in the year, sub-grantees were aware and planned
for visual and verbal updates to the Consortium .
The Continuum of Care, which includes the Cities of South Bend and Mishawaka, continued to meet
monthly to discuss program status and funding opportunities, and to address the broader issues of
homelessness and service in the community.

Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service
agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)

to expand types of members to include developers.
2. The Public Housing Authority is a member of the CoC

Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the
jurisdictions analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. 91.520{a)
The St. Joseph County Housing Consortium prepared an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing (AI) in
June, 2010. The AI found no substantial impediments to fair housing, however areas exist where access
to housing could be improved :
1. Monitor Federal guidelines for defining income.
Timeline: Ongoing.
The calculation of the federal poverty line does not take into account several expenses that affect an
individual's ability to pay for housing. These include, but are not limited

to, utility bills and child support

obligations. Such expenses should be factored in as reductions to income to recalculate rent to an
affordable level.
2. Continue analysis and efforts to expand the reach of the Human Rights Commission to the City of
Mishawaka and St. Joseph County.
Timeline : Ongoing
The South Bend Human Rights Commission could become a county-wide agency. The City of Mishawaka
engaged the services of an intern from Michigan State University's James Madison College of Public
Affairs to conduct preliminary research on a possible collaboration between South Bend and
Mishawaka. The information was forwarded to the Director of the South Bend Human Rights
Commission for use in drafting a plan to expand the Commission's jurisdiction to cover the City of
Mishawaka. However, funding shortages may slow the expansion. A county-wide agency would provide
local access for all residents who need to ask questions or file complaints about fair housing.
3. Support economic development efforts that improve employment prospects for low- and moderateincome individuals.
Timeline: Ongoing.
Development and investment in low-income areas should is encouraged . Low-income households
continue to be referred to budget and housing counseling programs to assist them to make positive
monetary decisions and build wealth .

4. Work with entities providing services to ex-offenders to lessen barriers to employment and
housing. Support organizations that provide housing and supportive services until an ex-offender
realizes employment.

Timeline: Underway; fund at least one such organization through summer 2012.
People returning to the community from prison often need assistance in securing jobs and affordable
housing. The Consortium is funding Dismas House, an organization which provides support and job
referral services to ex-offenders with ESG funds. With local dollars, the City of South Bend
Redevelopment Commission is funding Project Impact, an organization that provides job readiness
training, counseling, and education to ex-offenders to assist them in finding meaningful employment.

CR-40 - Monitoring 91.220 and 91.230
Description of the standards and procedures used to monitor activities carried out in
furtherance of the plan and used to ensure long-term compliance with requirements of the
programs involved, including minority business outreach and the comprehensive planning
requirements
On-site audits at local agencies receiving CDBG, HOME, ESG and NSP funds are scheduled per the HCD
Plan, to ensure compliance. The audits are performed by two staff members working together to review
accounting procedures and program rules. These on-site monitoring visits are in addition to the
monthly desk audits completed when reviewing sub-grantee claims, constant communication on
projects via phone and email, and various meetings to discuss program ~ssues. Each cla im for payment
submitted by a subrecipient requires a progress report relevant to the goals stated in the Scope of
Services. In 2013 the following on-site monitoring visits were conducted by staff, resulting in two
findings and one recommendation for a 6-month follow-up visit:
Commun ity Homebuyers Corporation (4/23/2013) - CDBG
REWARD (4/24/2013)- CDBG
South Bend Home Improvement Program (5/30/2013) - CDBG

Housing Assistance Office (9/12/2013) - HOME
Near Northwest Neighborhood (12/10/2013)- CDBG
Northeast Neighborhood Revitalization Organization (12/17/2013)- HOME

In addition, one desk monitoring of the City of Mishawaka's First-Time Homebuyer Program (HOME},
conducted in December 2013, resulted in one finding.

11. Project Outcomes Data measured under the performance standards developed in
consultation with the CoC(s)
The data reflected in the CAPER represents the 2013 program year. During the 2013 calendar year funds
from a variety of program years provided 67 households with rapid re- housing assistance and 4,269
households with emergency shelter services. For more detailed information about the breakdown of
fund ing fo r the 2013 calendar year see the attached ESG spreadsheet.
Using ESG funds, the City and the CoC worked to reduce the number of homeless households with
children, targeting rapid re-housing dollars for assistance to families. To measure the success of the CoC
members' rapid re-housing programs, clie nts will be contacted six months after thei r final ESG assistance
to assess their housing status. Th e CoC set a goal that at least 35% of participants assisted remain in
permanent housing six months after their final assistance. In calendar year 2013, one person had
received their final ESG assistance six months before the end of the year. This individual still resides in
permanent housing.

HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
FIRST YEAR ACTION PLAN (2015)

Including:
2015 Community Development Block Grant Action Plan for the City of
South Bend
2015 HOME Investment Partnership Program Action Plan for the
St. Joseph County Housing Consortium
2015 Emergency Solutions Grant Action Plan for the
City of South Bend

Executive Summary
ES-05 Executive Summary - 91.200(c), 91.220(b)
1.

Introduction

The 2015-2019 five-year Housing and Community Development Plan (HCD Plan) of the St. Joseph County
Housing Consortium indicates the priority needs and related objectives to support strong neighborhood
revitalization activity in St. Joseph County. The priority needs and objectives are outlined in the HCD
Plan under the following categories: Housing, Non-Housing Community Development, Homeless, and
Non-Homeless Special Needs.
The City of South Bend anticipates receiving an estimated $2,600,000 in federal resources for
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) each year.

2.

Summary of the objectives and outcomes identified in the Plan

Specific to CDBG funding, all of the activities are meant to coordinate with the geographic priorities of
the Vacant and Abandoned Housing Initiative and the West Side Corridors Plan. A preference will be
given to activities targeting the Lincolnway West Corridor and neighbohrod areas to the north and south
of Lincoln Way West in an attempt to be complementary and work together. The City of South Bend has
targeted the specific portions of the Near Northwest (Census Tract 6) and Near West Side (Census Tract
19) for programs that support existing owner occupants, promote first time homebuyers, provide for
the renovation of quality rental properties, and allow for the demolition of vacant and abandoned
structures in these areas. These neighborhoods show relatively low incomes and high concentrations of
poverty, high rates of residential vacancy and abandonment, and a high incidence of sub-prime
loans. The target areas, adjacent to downtown, are also areas that have begun to see some
redevelopment activity by local non-profit housing organizations and private developers.
Additionally, preference will also be given to the area bounded by Sample, Miami, Ewing and Michigan
Streets. This geography is the target area for a planning initiative launched by the City in partnership
with the new 466 Works organization. In addition to these target areas, the City of South Bend will focus
on services to the homeless and the prevention of homelessness nthoughout the community.
The 2015-2019 funding plan follows the basic parameters of previous plans, with emphasis on the
physical nature of revitalization activities as they relate to affordable housing. A strong emphasis on
neighborhood revitalization through partnerships with community development corporations,
rehabilitation of owner-occupied homes, and homeownership opportunities will occur.

The HOME Program anticipates an estimated $700,000 for housing programs throughout St. Joseph
County for each of the next 5 years. The HOME program will exceed the 25 percent match requirements
through private funding and project sponsors.
The ESG Program in the City of South Bend is allocated an estimated $190,000 yearly for emergency
shelter and rapid rehousing activities. ESG grant matching requirements will be satisfied using funds
from other federal, state, and private dollars.
Numerous sources of funding are expected to be available to supplement the federal dollars for
Supporting Homeowners and Helping Renters become Homeowners. In addition to annual CDBG and
HOME funds, Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP1 and 3) program income, private local financial
institution support, and general community donations are anticipated. A consortium of six local financial
institutions will continue to pool resources to provide mortgage assistance to new homeowners through
the Community Homebuyers Corporation (CHC) program. Rebuilding Together will rehab homes with
CDBG dollars and local labor and material donations. South Bend Home Improvement Program (SBHIP)
will rehab owner-occupied homes with CDBG.
Housing counseling will be made available through CDBG, South Bend city resources and state dollars via
the Indiana Foreclosure Prevention Network. Additionally, in 2011, the Hardest Hit Funds Program was
added to the tool box of assistance to those in foreclosure trouble. All of these funding sources allow the
counseling activity that supports the efforts for homeownership as noted previously. Over 200
households are expected to attend a counseling session and or class annually.

Evaluation of past performance

CDBG funds are used to ameliorate the impact of foreclosed, vacant and/or abandoned homes in South
Bend's low-moderate income neighborhoods through a demolition program. Demolitions will continue
to be funded with CDBG.
The City has a long history of successfully partnering with Community Development Corporations
(CDCs) to create affordable housing, both rental and owner-occupied. This partnership also provided the
means to create community meeting spaces and improve public facilities in low-mod income
neighborhoods. In addition, the City administers an owner-occupied home rehab program, and annually
provides additional homeowner assistance with CDBG funds to Rebuilding Together for home rehabs.
Direct homeownership assistance was provided to low-mod income first-time homebuyers through the
Community Homebuyers Corporation forgivable 2nd mortgage program.
To ensure compliance with applicable requirements, every CDBG, HOME and ESG subrecipient is
desktop-monitored multiple times throughout the year. This monitoring occurs with each claim for
reimbursement that is submitted to the Department of Community Investment (DCI). All subrecipients
receive feedback and/or guidance via email and phone communication, and in-person meetings with DCI
staff. In addition, DCI staff conduct at least eight (8) on-site monitoring visits of sub-grantees every year

to review their internal systems. As part of the monitoring visit, DCI staff meets with appropriate
members of the sub-grantee staff to review procedures, client files, financial records and other
pertinent data. Any new sub-recipient is monitored in their first year of funding.
Promoting Quality Rental Property is realized with the PHA's Section 8 vouchers, as well as HOME funds
for Tenant Based Rental Assistance and improvements to previously assisted rental units in St. Joseph
County.
Efforts to prevent homelessness and assist the homeless is supported with Emergency Solutions Grant
(ESG) funds, as well as HEARTH McKinney-Vento Homeless funds. ESG funding has been allocated for
operations of emergency shelters, outreach, rapid re-housing, homeless prevention and program
administration.

1.

Introduction

The HCD Plan is prepared in consultation with community, governmental, public housing authorities,
and nonprofit service and neighborhood organizations. Several federal, state and regional sources for
information on economic, health, assisted housing, and social service issues are utilized. Dialogue with
local sub-grantees and the Continuum of Care (CoC) is on-going.

Provide a concise summary of the jurisdictionâs activities to enhance coordination between
public and assisted housing providers and private and governmental health, mental health
and service agencies (91.215(I)).
The City has a seat on the CoC and attends meetings regularly. The Continuum continues to be very
active in working cooperatively to apply for relevant grants, and to assess their funding
opportunities/challenges. State policy to exclude St. Joseph County agencies from applying for State ESG
funds is a recognized issue that has impacted the community and the agencies. The Continuum
continues to advise local and state elected officials as to the real impact of this decision.
Regular CoC participants include: Oaklawn Psychiatric Center, which works primarily with mental illness
issues; AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist, which provides services to HIV/AIDS patients; Youth Service Bureau,
which services unaccompanied youth under the age of 25; YWCA, a domestic violence shelter; Dismas
House, which serves ex-offenders; the Center for the Homeless which provides services to homeless
persons/families; Life Treatment Centers, which treats persons with substance addictions; and, the
Veterans Administration, serving the veteran population. In addition, regular meetings and/or
discussions with representatives of local housing authorities, the Housing Assistance Office, Near
Northwest Neighborhood, REAL Services, the St. Joseph County Health Department and South Bend
Heritage Foundation take place.

Describe coordination with the Continuum of Care and efforts to address the needs of
homeless persons (particularly chronically homeless individuals and families, families with
children, veterans, and unaccompanied youth) and persons at risk of homelessness
The City and Continuum discussed and agreed that the ESG funds would be used to assist nonprofit
organizations that provide assistance to homeless individuals and families by supporting the following:
ï·
ï·

Broadening existing shelter activities.
Emphasizing Rapid Re-housing (helping individuals and families who are literally homeless [in a
shelter or sleeping in a place not meant for human habitation]) to quickly access permanent
housing.

Consolidated Plan
OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 07/31/2015)

SOUTH BEND

ï·
ï·
ï·

Helping people quickly regain stability in permanent housing after experiencing a housing crisis
and/or homelessness.
Aligning the ESG program with other HUD programs.
Supporting more coordinated and effective data collection, performance measurement, and
program evaluation.

Describe consultation with the Continuum(s) of Care that serves the jurisdiction's area in
determining how to allocate ESG funds, develop performance standards and evaluate
outcomes, and develop funding, policies and procedures for the administration of HMIS
The proposed performance standards are based on the regulations, desired outcomes, and experience
with HPRP. The Center for the Homeless has been and continues to be the Continuum's lead agency
with regard to HMIS. The Center maintains an individual as the lead point person who can assist with
training and any HMIS issues. The Center contracts directly with Client Track for HMIS service. All HMIS
users follow confidentiality and privacy requirements.

Narrative Description

All activities receiving South Bend's CDBG
funding are generally targeted to specific
and complementary geographies and
activities. In 2015 South Bend will continue
to target the Near Northwest and Near
West Side Neighborhoods through
partnerships with two CDCs, Habitat for
Humanity, and Rebuilding Together. These
areas show relatively low incomes and high
concentrations of poverty, high rates of
residential vacancy and abandonment, and
a high incidence of sub-prime loans. The
target areas, adjacent to downtown, are
also neighborhoods that have begun to see
some redevelopment activity and have
greater market potential. Programs that
assist existing owner-occupants with repairs
and promote first time homebuyers will
help support housing throughout the City of
0 South Bend.

needs
Specific to CDBG funding, all of the activities are meant to coordinate with the geographic priorities of
the Vacant and Abandoned Housing Initiative and the West Side Corridors Plan. A preference was given
to activities targeting the Lincolnway West Corridor and neighborhood areas to the north and south of
Lincoln Way West in an attempt to be complementary and work together. The City of South Bend has
targeted the specific portions of the Near Northwest (Census Tract 6) and Near West Side (Census Tract
19) for programs that support existing owner occupants, promote first time homebuyers and allow for
the demolition of vacant and abandoned structures in these areas. These neighborhoods show
relatively low incomes and high concentrations of poverty, high rates of residential vacancy and
abandonment, and a high incidence of sub-prime loans. The target areas, adjacent to downtown, are
also areas that have begun to see some redevelopment activity by local non-profit housing organizations
and private developers.
The Olive Street-Lincolnway West area, located within the Lincolnway West corridor and considered a
key node, was chosen for the Rebuilding Together Program. Additionally, preference was given to the
area bounded by Sample, Miami, Ewing and Michigan Streets. This geography is the target area for a
planning initiative launched by the City in partnership with the new 466 Works organization.

While 44% of federal funds will be directed to other sites across the City, it is anticipated that 36% of the
City of South Bend 2015 HCD Plan-related funds will be allocated to census tracts 6 and 19. These
neighborhoods show relatively low incomes and high concentrations of poverty, high rates of residential
vacancy and abandonment, and a high incidence of sub-prime loans. The target areas, adjacent to
downtown, are also areas that have begun to see some redevelopment activity, have greater market
potential, and have been areas of focus by local nonprofit housing organizations.

Rationale for the priorities for allocating investments geographically
Based on data received from HUD for the NSP1 and NSP3 programs, the areas of greatest need in the
City of South Bend were identified as Census Tracts 6, 4, 21, and 5, four of which are located in the Near
Northwest and Near West Neighborhoods. The City also identified Census Tracts 19 and 20 as areas of
greatest need based on the data and foreseen liklihood of foreclosures. Census Tract 19 is ranked as the
10th area most in need; however, it is believed that its proximity to four of the top five census tracts
makes it a critical area to help stabilize. For 2014 the City of South Bend will be focusing funds for
housing activities in Census Tracts 6 and 19.
Additionally, the geographic allocation of resources was based upon:

AP-65 Homeless and Other Special Needs Activities - 91.420, 91.220(i)
Introduction

Describe the jurisdictions one-year goals and actions for reducing and ending homelessness
including:
Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their
individual needs
The Continuum of Care (CoC) agencies have worked together to design and implement a collaborative
process based on referrals and complementary programs and services.

Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons
The CoC continues to discuss and work on strategies that will result in the following priorities:
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·

Restructuring the traditional shelter system toward the Housing First model and meeting Hearth
Act priorities.
Focusing on rapid re-housing activities with the HPRP to ESG transition.
Using two distinct approaches, one for situational impoverished homeless individuals and one
for the chronically improverished homeless, to re-house them.
Reducing the unsheltered or precariously housed population.
Reducing the time spent in transitional housing.

Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families
with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to
permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that
individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals
and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were
recently homeless from becoming homeless again
The chronically homeless, severely mentally ill, veterans, persons with HIV/AIDS, victims of domestic
violence, and youth will be moved into rapid re-housing options rather than the traditional shelter
system; the chronic substance abuse homeless subpopulation will use a traditional shelter model with
expanded services and programs. The Center for the Homeless established a homeless veteran facility.
The CoC is also considering a facility for the chronically homeless who typically stay outside of the
shelter system.

Helping low-income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely
low-income individuals and families and those who are: being discharged from publicly

funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care facilities, mental health facilities,
foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions); or, receiving
assistance from public or private agencies that address housing, health, social services,
employment, education, or youth needs.
Discharge planning within the community continues to be extremely difficult. While the hospitals and
community mental health centers have coordinated plans with the emergency shelter facilities, they are
still less than ideal for an individual just released from their care. Additionally, county and state
correctional facilities are not coordinating their releases; it is not uncommon to have an individual arrive
at a facility with paperwork ordering them into residence when there is no available bed. With the
support of the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, the CoC has been working with
the State Department of Correction and the Department of Child Services to improve the coordination
of discharge policies.
The St. Joseph County CoC developed the following discharge coordination policies for foster care,
health care, and mental health systems of care.
Foster Care: The Indiana Division of Child Services case managers are responsible for creating
individualized plans for each youth being discharged from foster care. They are responsible for case
planning, and reunification conferences with providers including foster parents, birth parents, children
(when age appropriate), and Court Appointed Special Advocates. Youth aging out of foster care receive
independent living services that cover areas such as financial independence, educational needs,
vocational needs, mental health and substance abuse treatment. The Division of Child Services has a
written protocol and partners with appropriate community providers to ensure that youth discharged
from foster care are not discharged into the streets.
Health Care: Memorial Hospital and Health Care Systems and St. Joseph Regional Medical Center are the
two major health care centers in the community. Both have written protocols concerning the Discharge
Planning and Process in place. Discharge planning begins at the time of admission. The protocols state
that the social worker/case manager shall provide assistance when identified or requested.
Mental Health: Oaklawn Psychiatric Center has numerous written policies, protocols, and
Memorandums of Understanding involving discharge of homeless or potentially homeless
individuals. When an individual is considered potentially homeless, the protocol instructs the social
worker to contact the Center for the Homeless and/or other shelters to determine whether the
individual is banned, timed-out or needs to go to the grievance board.

AP-75 Barriers to affordable housing - 91.420, 91.220(j)
Introduction
The following public policies could negatively impact affordable housing and residential investment in St.
Joseph County:
Property Tax Rate - Homeowners in South Bend and Mishawaka pay city taxes while those in the County
Remainder do not. To address this problem, South Bend has implemented a residential tax abatement
program. In addition, the County Property Tax Rate for St. Joseph County is the second highest in the
State.
Design Standards - South Bend and Mishawaka require design improvements such as curbs, sidewalks
and drainage. The areas within the unincorporated county do not require these infrastructure
improvements.
Building Codes and Local Historic Districts - Codes related to construction and development allow no
special provision waivers for the construction of new, or rehab of existing, affordable housing. The lack
of provision waivers for affordable housing could be considered a barrier to the development of
affordable housing.
Local regulations for historic districts require exterior compatibility at the time of renovation or
rehabilitation, possibly imposing costs which could make the development of affordable housing within
those districts more expensive.
Regulatory Barriers in the Rural and Suburban Areas - Roughly sixty percent of the land in the
unincorporated areas of St. Joseph County is zoned agricultural, meaning a home built in the district
must have a minimum of a twenty acre lot. This requirement limits the development of affordable
housing in areas zoned agricultural.

Actions it planned to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve
as barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning
ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the
return on residential investment
Support for the development efforts that improve employment prospects for low/mod income
individuals is ongoing. People returning to the community from prison often need assistance in securing
jobs and affordable housing. The City of South Bend awarded HPRP, 2nd Allocation 2011 ESG funds, and
2013 ESG funds to Dismas House, an organization which provides support and job referral services to exoffenders, for the time period of October 2009 - December 2013. The agency did not apply to the City
for 2014 ESG funds.
The Residential Tax Abatement program is available to potential homeowners for consideration when

thinking about homeownership. This allows a phasing in the costs that can lessen the immediate
financial burden and, coupled with the legislative property tax cap, could be critical to new
homeowners.
The City of South Bend will continue its Housing Counseling and Homebuyer Education programs.
Although not a financial mechanism, being better educated and understanding the costs and risks of
homeownership can direct individuals where their situation best suits them. Understanding if and when
a home purchase is a viable option is most critical.
In an effort to expand the jurisdiction of the South Bend Human Rights Commission, the Chair of the
Commission and the Executive Director met with the Mishawaka Common Council on October 7,
2013. Additionally, conversations are ongoing with the St. Joseph County Commissioners.

AP-85 Other Actions - 91.420, 91.220(k)
Introduction

Actions planned to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs
1. The City of South Bend continues to work on developing creative solutions and possible resources to
address the issue.
2. Continuing the emphasis on homeowner rehab support to assist owners with being able to remain in
their homes.
3. City's continuing support of housing counseling, successful renewal of Indiana Foreclosure Prevention
Network (IFPN) and Hardest Hit Funds (HHF) awards, and outreach efforts for Making Home Affordable
will ultimately assist those facing foreclosure.
4. Continuum of Care strategic planning to strenghten the structure, communication and efforts to
support the homeless and special needs populations through the following actions:
ï·
ï·

ï·
ï·
ï·

Broaden existing shelter and homelessness prevention activities.
Emphasize Rapid Re-housing (helping individuals and families who are literally homeless [in a
shelter or sleeping place not meant for human habitation]) to quickly access permanent
housing.
Help people quickly regain stability in permanent housing after experiencing a housing crisis
and/or homelessness.
Align the ESG program with other HUD programs.
Support more coordinated and effective data collection, performance measurement, and
program evaluation.

Actions planned to foster and maintain affordable housing
The age of the housing stock in the inner cities creates certain challenges for neighborhoods particularly
if the houses within it have not been properly been maintained. This sometimes occurs because of a
concentration of low income homeowners without sufficient means to keep up with the maintenance
requirements of an older home. To assist these residents, South Bend supports the inclusion of the
following activities:
ï·

Grants to owner occupied homes for Home rehabilitation/repair/purchase
Home modifications for elderly and disabled homeowners

Actions planned to reduce lead-based paint hazards
All homeownership rehab programs receiving federal dollars work collaboratively with the St. Joseph
County Health Department and the Housing Authority of South Bend (HASB). To address lead hazard
remediation, the Health Department, in partnership with HASB, applied for and received a $3 million
HUD Lead Hazard Control grant in 2006. The community provided more than $1 million in matching and
in-kind support toward this grant. In 2012, the Health Department, in partnership with the Housing
Authority of South Bend, applied for and received additional funding in the amount of $2.48 million,
with a match/local contributions of $1,401,863. The HASB is currently marketing a program that invites
homeowners to have their homes tested for lead with the possibility of having the lead remediated
through the Lead Hazard Control Grant.
The Housing Authority of South Bend maintains a Section 8 Landlord Assistance Program in which any
resident living in a Section 8 unit that has been identified as lead contaminated and where the owner
refuses to bring the home into a lead safe status, has an absolute preference on the Public Housing
waiting list for the first available unit. Additionally, any pre-1978 Section 8 home that is identified during
the Housing Authorityâs Annual Housing Quality Standards Inspection as having chipping, peeling or
cracking paint must receive and pass a clearance test by a State certified inspection.
These policies have significantly increased the number of affordable housing units that are lead-safe in
the City. The HASB also maintains an active list of current lead safe addresses at
http://www.hasbonline.com/docs/safe.pdf

Actions planned to reduce the number of poverty-level families
The Center for the Homeless STAR (Skilled, Trained, Able, and Ready) program addresses the root causes
of poverty by assisting participants with job readiness, externships, job retention, and job search.Bridges
Out of Poverty is a local program based on a nationally recognized model that educates both the lowincome individual and the business community on working together to address issues that prevent
people in poverty from becoming employed.In 2014, the City of South Bend, in conjunction with the City
of Mishawaka, the St. Joseph County Chamber of Commerce, IVY Tech Community College, WorkOne
Development, and a number of local businesses launched a new workforce training initiative,
"Supporting Manufacturers and Regional Talent" (SMART). SMART assists residents in obtaining the
necessary skills to participate in a wider range of employment opportunities. Participants are trained
through IVY Tech as skilled workers in manufacturing. The program helps develop a skilled workforce to

meet the needs of local manufacturers.

Actions planned to develop institutional structure
South Bend continues to utilize a team approach to working with its partners in implementing the
programs/projects funded through the various federal sources. The Community Investment staff
regularly communicates with all sub-grantees, and meets with those entities involved in the targeted
areas. Regularly scheduled meetings with the CDCs occur due to the nature of the work and the amount
of funds allocated.
The targeted geography approach meshes the efforts of the South Bend City departments, the CDCs,
and other nonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity, to broadly plan and advance the City's efforts. The
HOME, CDBG and NSP funds targeted to the Near Westside and Near Northwest neighborhoods offer an
opportunity for all of these entities to work together using their various areas of expertise to support
the successful conclusion of the plan.
Staff meets with an entity upon approval of a project and prior to contracting. In addition, desktop
monitoring and on-site monitoring occur.
The Consortium members are continually informed as to project/program status at their meetings
during the year. Scheduled in advance of the beginning of the year, sub-grantees are aware and plan for
visual and verbal updates.
The Continuum of Care members, who include the City of South Bend, continue to meet every month to
discuss program status and funding opportunities, and to address the broader issues of homelessness in
the community.

Actions planned to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social
service agencies
The Continuum of Care is formalizing their structure, Board and membership; monthly, as well as special
topic CoC meetings are held; the CoC seeks to expand membership to include developers, and others
with diverse backgrounds.
2. The Public Housing Authority is a member of the CoC.
3. The City, through it's partnership with the Urban Enterprise Association of South Bend, Inc., is in
discussion with United Way and 1st Source Bank to launch a Bank On program. Bank On is one tool to
help address the financial literacy of residents in the community. Bank On works to connect unbanked
and underbanked residents with safe and affordable financial services.4.

Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG)
Reference 91.220(l)(4)
1. Include written standards for providing ESG assistance (may include as attachment)
The Continuum of Care agrees that any client is eligible to receive assistance up to 12 months within
a 3 year period as determined by the certification process required for all ESG clients. The
Continuum of Care anticipates this timeframe to be of assistance, and believes it supports the rapid
re-housing emphasis of the program. It is the case manager's responsibility to document client need
and ensure that ESG is the most appropriate assistance for the client. Any potential client must go
through a detailed intake process in order to determine and document eligibility to participate in
the program. Case managers will consistently reevaluate the need for assistance during the 12
month period. All sub-grantees are expected to provide support to clients for the full time
neccessary to stabilize that client and provide for the likelihood of a positive housing outcome after
assistance.
2. If the Continuum of Care has established centralized or coordinated assessment system that

meets HUD requirements, describe that centralized or coordinated assessment system.
Continuum of Care agencies participate in a coordinated assessment system, where client entry into
homelessness prevention or rapid re-housing programs can begin at any point within the system.
Service providers will use a common assessment tool that will allow providers to enter data on a
client and provide transfer information when a client fits the services of another provider, without

having to engage in another assessment. Reasons for client transfer can include better fit into a
specialized program, the correct geographic service area, and available resources within the
community.
3. Identify the process for making sub-awards and describe how the ESG allocation available to

private nonprofit organizations (including community and faith-based organizations).
The City of South Bend has the final decision making authority on the selection of proposals to be
funded. Proposals will be evaluated and preference given to those which address the following:
ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·

ï·
ï·
ï·
ï·

Top priority will be given to agencies that are actively involved in the Continuum of Care.
Allow for the most efficient and cost-effective use of ESG Program funds so that as many homeless
individuals and families as possible will be assisted.
Demonstrate a committment to the project in terms of time, effort, resources, etc.
Include a realistic, detailed financial package that documents the ability of the applicant entity to
match the Emergency Solutions Grant funds and demonstrates the ability to leverage financing from
other sources. (Expenditures should be explained).
Describe the nature and extent of the (documented) unmet homeless need within the applicant's
jurisdiction and detailed extent to which the proposed activities address the need.
Provide the ability of the applicant entity to carry out the proposed activities within the 2014
program year.
Demonstrate effectiveness in serving the homeless, including the ability to establish, maintain,
and/or improve the self-suffiency of homeless individuals.
Timeliness of reimbursement request/draw requests will be considered for currently or previously
funded entities.
It is a HUD policy that, within the framework of constitutional church-state guidelines, faith-based
organizations should be able to compete on an equal footing with other organizations for federal
funding. Accordingly, organizations that are faith-based are eligible, on the same basis as any other
organization, to participate in HUD programs and activities, and therefore the City of South Bend's
HUD-funded programs and activites.

4. If the jurisdiction is unable to meet the homeless participation requirement in 24 CFR

576.405(a), the jurisdiction must specify its plan for reaching out to and consulting with
homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering policies and funding decisions
regarding facilities and services funded under ESG.
The City, along with the Continuum of Care, has as their combined agenda, the development of a
long term plan to include homeless participation on the Continuum. All sub-grantees are required to
involve program participants in the operation of their ESG funded program. This involvement can be
in the form of a program participants' employment or volunteering in program activities such as
construction, renovation, maintenance, general operation of facilities, and provision of services. For
Consolidated Plan

example, a shelter might involve participants in ongoing maintenance tasks or other operations of
the facility such as staffing the reception desk. This involvement can include paid and/or volunteer
work.
5. Describe performance standards for evaluating ESG.
The City, like HUD, recognizes that performance standards will evolve over the next few years as the
ESG Interim Rule is implemented and as ESG sub-grantees improve their program outcomes through
evaluation of HMIS data and through the integration of ESG services into the Continuum of Care.
Implementation of the Emergency Solutions Grant will allow the City to gain baseline data about
specific performance measures and performance standards. Baseline information from FY 2012 and
FY 2013 will be used to further refine measures and standards for the FY 2014 ESG funds. When
developing the performance standards, the City will also consider which data elements were
required to be collected in HMIS for ESG, and additional data elements included in the March 2010
HMIS Data Standards. Discussion to date has included standards of housing stability; maintaining
income/employment; access to other resources assistance; and the ability of a client to not fall back
into a homeless situation. The CoC will continue to be a consulting partner as the ESG performance
standards are finalized.
Performance Measures for Homelessness Prevention: A reduction in the number of homeless
households involving families with children (a priority need for homeless assistance within the
local Continuum of Care community)
Expected Outcome: At least 35% of participants assisted will remain in permanent housing six (6)
months after the last assistance provided under ESG.
Performance Measure for Homeless Rapid Re-Housing: A reduction in the number of homeless
households involving families with children, both sheltered and unsheltered (a priority need for
homeless assistance within the local Continuum of Care community).
Expected Outcome: At least 35% of participants assisted will remain in permanent housing six (6)
months after the last assistance provided under ESG.

CR-05 - Goals and Outcomes
Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan. 91.520(a)
Include categories, priority levels, funding sources and amounts, outcomes/objectives, goal outcome indicators, units of measure, targets, actual
outcomes/outputs, and percentage completed for each of the granteeâs program year goals.
IDIS PR23 CDBG and HOME Summary of Accomplishments reports that the City is making progress staying on schedule in completing projects
identified in the 2015 Action Plan. CDBG funds assisted 197,266 households, and HOME completions accounted for forty-five (45) low-tomoderate housing units; 21 rental units and 24 homebuyer units.
In the 2015 Action Plan goals included helping homeless initiatives. Agencies assisting the homeless report ESG data in HMIS and not in the IDIS
system. As a result, the IDIS generated reports do not reflect all the accomplishments satisfied. Another reason for some goals not satisfied
include the payment of invoices in 2016, when the projects were completed at year-end.
The City of Evansvilleâs 2015 Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) is the first year-end account demonstrating the
accomplishments of goals outlined in the 2015-2019 Consolidate Plan administrating Community Development Block Grants,(CDBG) Emergency
Solution Grants, (ESG) and HOME Investment Partnerships Grants (HOME). During the consolidated planning process the City obtained citizensâ
opinions on Community and Housing Needs by conducting several public meetings and distributed surveys at the meetings, including posting the
survey on the City of Evansville website. The survey questions were generated from the IDIS Matrix eligible activities, requesting the public to
rate each activity as a high, medium, or low priority need.
Citizens identified 30 high and 5 medium priority community development needs that were grouped into broader categories; childcare services,
youth programs, senior services, disability services, employment training/job placement, infrastructure and facility improvements, etc. Some
high priority needs are being addressed by public and private organizations that do not request funding from CDBG, ESG, and HOME grant funds;
street improvements, mental health services, abused and neglected children, water & sewer improvements, etc.
The homeless service activities are funded with ESG funds and are automatically classified as high priority needs. A consortium of homeless
services agencies, as well as the City, work collaboratively in addressing the homeless needs of the community.
Three (3) high and two (2) medium priority housing needs identified in the survey included; rehab of existing rental units, rental units for elderly
(1-2BR), rehab of existing owner units for low-to-moderate income households, rental units small related (1-2 BRs) very-low income Rental units,
CAPER

small related (1-2 BRs) low-to-moderate income households, and other housing goals were directed by the annual marketing study. Other
housing goals were directed by an annual market study, currently prepared by Bowen National Research, pinpointing the single-family housing
and rental housing needs in the community based on the current conditions of the market in Evansville, Indiana.
Each 2015 grant funded project/activity linked the numerous priority needs with the following six categories: Homeless Needs (HL-1 thru HL-11),
Housing Needs (HS-1 thru HS-10), Special Needs (SN-1 thru SN-3), Community Development Needs (CD-1 thru CD -7) Economic Development
Needs (ED-1 thru ED-3) and Administrative Needs (AM-1 thru AM-2).

Comparison of the proposed versus actual outcomes for each outcome measure submitted with the consolidated plan and
explain, if applicable, why progress was not made toward meeting goals and objectives. 91.520(g)
Categories, priority levels, funding sources and amounts, outcomes/objectives, goal outcome indicators, units of measure, targets, actual
outcomes/outputs, and percentage completed for each of the granteeâs program year goals.

Assess how the jurisdictionâs use of funds, particularly CDBG, addresses the priorities and specific objectives identified in the
plan, giving special attention to the highest priority activities identified.
During the grant application process, organizations applying for CDBG, ESG, and HOME grant funds must be operating a program that addresses
at least one of the three National Objectives and at least one of the high or medium priority community or housing development needs. The most
frequently used national objective used in the grant applications is Low-to-Moderate Income benefit; either low-to-moderate clientele or low-tomoderate area benefits. The second national objective most used in applications is Slum Blight, resulting in the demolition and disposition of
property. The Urgency Need National Objective has not been used.
The highest ranked community development priority need is - Assisting Abused and Neglected Children and Children Facilities â The City
provides ESG funding to domestic violence shelters while CDBG allocations assist an emergency daycare program and ten (10) youth programs
addressing the needs of at risk children.
The City publishes public notices in the Evansville Courier and Press and Our Times Newspaper, as well as contacting HOLA, inviting
organizations to apply for grant funds and participate in the grant training workshops. The high priority needs survey results are included in the
grant application packets notifying applicants of the high and medium community development and housing needs.

Table 2 â Table of assistance to racial and ethnic populations by source of funds

Narrative
The Racial and Ethnic composition chart discloses there is a diverse population in Evansville and that the
populations are served proportionately. Eighty-three (83%) percent of the Evansville, Indiana population
is white, and Eleven (11%) percent are black/ African Americans. Smaller populations include the
Hispanic and Asian populations.
Historically and currently, the Central Submarket or urban core continues to retain the largest population
of low-income households where nearly one in three households (32.4%) are living at or below the
poverty rate. The same submarket, also has the highest share of residents without a high school diploma.
Supporting the affordable housing needs of the market, the City encourages developers, and CHDOs to
invest in low-income census tracts, including the Central Submarket.
Addressing the high priority housing needs in the Central Submarket with the gradual reduction of federal
funds The question is how we can the City manage to serve the low income households majority in the
Central Submarket and overcome funding limitations. Understanding the demographic composition of the
submarket and low income census tracts is crucial to the City when addressing community development
and affordable housing needs. The central submarket is an area that receives consistent voice and
attention at public meetings.
Racial and Ethnic data for beneficiaries assisted with ESG funds come from the data in the HMIS system.
With regard to ESG, funds are designed to be one step in the continuum of assistance to prevent
homelessness. The goal is to ultimately eliminate homelessness and allow families to move toward
independent living. The racial/ethnic composition of households assisted through ESG funds is as
follows:

Explain how federal funds leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds),
including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any
publicly owned land or property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the
needs identified in the plan.

CHDOs or developers, must provide a subsidy layering report with a budget and timeline to DMD prior
to the execution of the Grant Agreement. The review of the documents must indicate that the HOME
Match requirement of 12.5 % is being met. Typically the match is greater than the requirement. Sources
of match include assistance from the Indiana Housing Community Development Authority, (IHCDA) in
the form of Low-Income-Tax Credits or an Affordable Housing Program grant, cash from the sale of
a previous HOME project or pre-sale of the current project, in-kind donations, and appraised land
values.

Discuss the difference between goals and outcomes and problems encountered in meeting
these goals.
In preparation of the 2015 -2019 Consolidated Plan and 2015 Action Plan the City identified the total
households served over a five year period following annual goals, with 2015 representing the first year.
In 2015 the âGOALâ represented the total five year goal, while the âACTUAL âis true to the
accomplishment level. At least five housing projects were delayed as the result of projects in progress
with no accomplishment data to complete the projects or contractor delays.
Agencies prior to the execution of the grant agreement must determine the number of people or
households that will be served for a year. The number being served is documented in the grant
agreement budget and in IDIS. The outcome is the year-end accomplishment number of people
/households served when the December monitoring report is provided to DMD.

There was an increase in chronic homeless households reported, as agencies do a better job of having
homeless households assessed for disabilities. The focus is on permanent supportive housing units for
homeless households that are severely disabled, rapid re-housing for homeless households that need a
little bit of help getting back on their feet, and diversion efforts that prevent homelessness altogether.
Discuss how these outcomes will impact future annual action plans.
The outcomes of the housing projects identified in the 2015-2019 Consolidated Plan will be completed in
five years and increase the affordable housing stock in Evansville for income low-to moderate income
households. The City desires to increase the housing stock and remain in compliance with the U.S
Department of Housing and Urban Development grant program requirements. Delays are occasionally
necessary for the City to work with CHDOs and Developers to ensure that projects will be completed to
meet local and state building standards, procurement requirements, and to represent affordable housing
for the occupants.
Through desk monitoring and technical assistance, agencies work with staff to evaluate the productivity
of their programs. Goal adjustments may be needed to correct the outcome. It is likely that some agencies
may set a goal too high, or count unduplicated numbers for duplicated numbers. Failure to satisfy goals
may result in the repayment of funds and the discontinuation of the program

CR-25 - Homeless and Other Special Needs 91.220(d, e); 91.320(d, e); 91.520(c)
Evaluate the jurisdictionâs progress in meeting its specific objectives for reducing and ending
homelessness through:
Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their
individual needs
We started a pilot program in conjunction with the State of Indiana and Corporation of Supportive
Housing using a coordinated assessment tool and established a coordinated entry system in 2015 for
permanent supportive housing. We will further expand to include rapid re-housing, and hopefully public
housing units in 2016. We used an assessment tool from the National Alliance to End Homelessness and
as a secondary tool, an assessment tool from the Downtown Emergency Service Center of Seattle. In
2016, the State of Indiana has proposed switching to the VI-SPDAT from Orgcode Consultants.

Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons
The Aurora Homeless Outreach team has been a critical piece to the success of street outreach and case
management of our shelters. All of our transitional housing programs are re-evaluating their funding
and services, as HUD has shifted to an emphasis on rapid re-housing.
The number one need identified by the homeless services agencies is the need for more case
management. We need to expand case management with housing opportunities, however the case
management we do have, was in jeopardy of losing funding in 2015. The City-County Commission on
Homelessness is looking for community funding for case management. It was discussed in 2015 that we
need coordinated case management that will work within the coordinated entry system implemented in
2015.

Helping low-income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely
low-income individuals and families and those who are: likely to become homeless after being
discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care facilities,
mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and
institutions); and, receiving assistance from public or private agencies that address housing,
health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs
We fund discharge planning in conjunction with the Aurora Re-Entry program with most of our emphasis
in 2015 was on the re-entry population. We coordinate with Deaconess Health Systems and ECHO
Healthcare to better facilitate release from the hospitals. United Caring Services in partnership with
Deaconess Health System created a pilot homeless medical respite program for men; the menâs shelter
space. St. Maryâs Hospital and ECHO Healthcare could also option in for a bed as needed. The program
was extremely successful, and plans are underway to implement a homeless medical respite for all

genders in 2016.
The Homeless Health Coalition has been visiting crisis invention centers in other cities that would allow a
coordinated space for homeless medical respite, mental health respite, medically vulnerable respite,
sobering station, and those who fall in-between services such as non-binary homeless and transgender.
United Caring Services is coordinated with the homeless services community and is looking to renovate
their space based on the needs of these gap populations. 29 men spent a collective total of 898 nights in
the respite and 11 of the 29 were veterans.

Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families
with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to
permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that
individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals
and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were
recently homeless from becoming homeless again
The performance standards were developed in conjunction with the governing body for the Indiana
Balance of State Continuum of Care and the Indiana Planning Council on the Homeless by using the
national standards outlined in Section 427 of the McKinney-Vento Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act.
Baseline measurements for the system-wide objectives will be developed upon program inception by
IHCDA using the HMIS.
The City of Evansville ESG program will further the goals of Continuum of Care and further the stateâs
efforts to end homelessness by following common performance goals established by the Indiana
Planning Council. The guiding philosophies include a Housing First model for homelessness solutions, the
need for an effective outreach and triage infrastructure to prevent homelessness and to rapidly rehouse individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and the proven efficacy of permanent
supportive housing and rapid re-housing. IHCDA on behalf of the State of Indiana received one of the
top scores in the nation for the Continuum of Care application and HUD supports the continuation of the
performance standards and strategic objectives.
The following goals were believed to be either met or exceeded, however documentation of exact
percentages remains difficult due to technical issues with HMIS. Many clients also leave without
documentation making the measurement of the goals more difficult.

CR-30 - Public Housing 91.220(h); 91.320(j)
Actions taken to address the needs of public housing
EHA is excited to announce a new, transformational program that will provide our residents with a
better quality of life while also helping to ensure that EHA will continue to fulfill its mission far into the
future. That program is known as the Rental Assistance Demonstration project, or RAD.
RAD provides new, stable means of funding for public housing renovations and improvements. Under
RAD, selected public housing authorities, including EHA, will be able to maintain and improve properties
regardless of Congressional funding.
RAD is a voluntary, limited program; fewer than 60,000 public housing units around the country will be
selected. EHA is proud to have been chosen as one of the demonstration sites. This is an incredible
opportunity for our city and our residents.
The program is still in its early stages, and there are many things that have to be accomplished legally
before any renovations or improvements begin. We anticipate that those will begin in 2015 and
continue through 2016.

Actions taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in
management and participate in homeownership
The Family Self Sufficiency Program (F.S.S.) through the Evansville Housing Authority (EHA) will continue
to work in collaboration with HOPE of Evansville to provide pre-purchase counseling and HOME funds
for down payment assistance to eligible participants to purchase homes. EHA has established Resident
Councils for most of their developments, including a council to represent their scattered sites. The
purpose of each Resident Council is to provide activities for their respective residents, increase
awareness of issues for residents, serve as a liaison between the residents and EHA management, and
motivate residents towards self-sufficiency. During the 2015 plan year, EHA will continue to work to
strengthen the councils as well as re-establish councils in developments where councils have become
defunct. A new Executive Director was brought into the Evansville Housing Authority in 2012, Rick
Moore, who is engaged with the community and brought over 25 years of leadership in low income
housing and management. The EHA reports that on any given day in 2014 there was a waiting list of
roughly 2000 persons in the Evansville area for units owned and/or managed by the EHA and over 500
households who have Section 8 vouchers approved, waiting for approved dwelling units to occupy. The
EHA established Advantix, a 501 (C) 3 subsidiary with its own board of directors to foster the
rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of some housing units owned but unused. In collaboration with the
Department of Metropolitan Development, Advantix became a CHDO and a CBDO in 2013. In 2015 using
HOME funds, three living units will be rehabbed to provide permanent supportive housing for 50% AMI
residents using workers from the Youth Build program, providing disadvantaged youth the opportunity
to earn income and obtain solid work experience

N/A
CR-35 - Other Actions 91.220(j)-(k); 91.320(i)-(j)

Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as
barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning
ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the
return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i)
The City of Evansville, Indiana addresses barriers to affordable housing through the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development by familiarity with HOME, CDBG, and ESG regulations, as well as,
discussing policy with the Indianapolis, Indiana field office. Every month the City conducts a public
meeting, âThe Traveling City Hallâ, where the Mayor of Evansville, and his department representatives
provide an opportunity to discuss issues with the public, including those identified in the question.
Departments that could take action on addressing affordable housing barriers, but not limited to,
include, the Human Relations Commission, the Department of Metropolitan Development, the Area Plan
Commission, the Building Commission and the Metropolitan Planning Office.

Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Agencies receiving CDBG, HOME, and ESG grant funds typically apply and receive non-federal funds for
the activities. Some of the non-federal resources include: United Way funds, foundation grants,
corporation grants, church grants, private donations, and fundraisers to address both housing and
community development needs. Sub-recipients of HUD funds are required to provide documentation of
matching funds prior to the execution of an Agreement with the City of federal funding.
Recipients receiving HOME funds were required to match 12.5% of a total project budget. See the HOME
match report for details.
Recipients receiving Emergency Solutions Grant Funds are required to match 50% of their grant
allocation from the City.
Presently, the Community Development Block Grant does not require a match, however, all public
service agencies applying for grant funds must demonstrate in their proposals that their total project
will not be 100% dependent on CDBG funds
Listed are some obstacles to meeting underserved needs: A lack of short term rental assistance
programs and adequate housing available to families continues to be a major obstacle in addressing
underserved needs in many Indiana communities. Underserved needs include housing for people with
AIDS, Permanent & Transitional Housing, Rental Housing for elderly â 51-80% AMI, rental housing for
CAPER
OMB Control No: 2506-0117 (exp. 07/31/2015)

23

small related families â 30%AMI and Owner â Occupied housing for families 31-80% AMI. The reduction
in federal funding with increasing need for housing and services is also an obstacle.

Actions taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Actions taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards include evaluating every affordable housing project
funded with CDBG and HOME grant funds. The Community Development Inspector, certified as a HUD
Risk Assessor and Supervisor, evaluates HOME rental rehabs, HOME owner-occupied rehabs, CDBG
emergency home repairs, and HOME down payment assistance projects. All properties built prior to
1978 are assumed to contain lead and are tested.
The lead conditions are addressed in the written specifications so the appropriate actions are taken to
protect the occupants from Lead Poisoning. Rehab projects require all contractors to be properly
licensed in Vanderburgh County, Evansville, Indiana, and have the EPA Renovate, Repair, and Paint
Certification.
Agencies providing any type of assistance utilizing CDBG and/or HOME are required to provide Lead
Safety pamphlets to all applicants. The âRenovate Rightâ pamphlet is distributed to occupants prior to
beginning the repairs, and âProtect Your Family in Your Homeâ is distributed to occupants when
renovations do not occur.
The Vanderburgh County Health Department provides health fairs and educational information to the
public on various health-related issues including Lead Based Paint poisoning. In addition lead based
paint testing is available through the VCHD. DMD occasionally obtains technical services from the VCHD

Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty-level families. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Evansville Christian Life Center is the lead agency for anti-poverty initiatives. They started a new
program called GAIN to help households make their way out of poverty and to reduce public assistance.
Unfortunately, 2015 was mostly a year of transition between programs for anti-poverty initiatives. In
April, we had 30 Days of Poverty to increase awareness of poverty in the Evansville and Vanderburgh
community. We also have a local chapter of RESULTS, a community based group that advocates for
poverty legislation.

Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
The City of Evansville works with the Evansville Common Council to allocate funding to the necessary
areas in need of community services or housing. Partnerships are formed with local banks that provide
community investment funds, and the two major hospitals also are also provide community
development funding to address housing and economic needs in the community.

Key components of assuring the public service activities that are funded represent the needs of the
community is the appointment of the Citizens advisory Committee (CAC). Appointed by the Mayor, the
CAC is the first step of a three tier process for public service funds. The nine CAC members are selected
as follows: five community/neighborhood representatives, two representatives from United Way
Allocations Committee, and two mayoral appointees. Recommendations made by the CAC are
forwarded to the Mayor and final allocations are made by City Council.
In 2015, DMD continued to work to expand current organizations as well as extend funding
opportunities to agencies that will satisfy the community development and housing needs identified in
the 2015-2019 Consolidated Plan. Neighborhood groups, developers, lenders, and non-profits maintain
partnerships providing continued support on City initiatives.

Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service
agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Coordinated assessment was officially started in 2015 with a pilot program working with the State of
Indiana, IHCDA, and Corporation for Supportive Housing. Only permanent supportive housing units
were place through coordinated assessment in 2015. In 2015, the pilot program through the
Coordinated Entry Task Force, that started mid-year successfully place 26 households in permanent
supportive housing, only three households were denied admittance. Over 114 assessments were done
by the Aurora Outreach Team. At the end of 2015, there were 17 active assessments of households that
needed permanent supportive housing however we lack enough permanent supportive housing units.
Discussions to include all sectors in the coordinated entry system, which provides housing to special
populations and the homeless was also started in 2015. Discussions will likely take most of 2016. The
Evansville Housing Authority (EHA) was a partner in these discussions, as well as over 30 agencies, but
EHA does not have designated or prioritized units for the homeless at this point. EHA and most of the
local social agencies identified that more case management as the biggest barrier to providing long term
permanent housing. Unfortunately, what case management that we had locally in 2015 in jeopardy as
HUD has shifted toward providing more funds directly for housing. Planning to expand case
management while existing case management funding is at risk delayed implementation in 2015.

Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the
jurisdictions analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. 91.520(a)
The City engaged with local organizations to review the six (6) benchmarks identified in the 2015 Action
Plan and presented in the 2015-2019 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing.

( 1). Convene a local consortium to discuss housing for ex-offenders, best practices, and develop a
strategy for Evansville and Hold a roundtable discussion and discuss findings. The City supports the
Welcome HOME 82 Initiative, aimed at assisting homeless or at- risk of homelessness ex-offenders who
are trying to acquire housing and program services. Through the collaboration with the Corporation for
Supportive Housing, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority (IHCDA), Vanderburgh
Superior Court, Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Indiana, and Deaconess Hospital the program can fully
integrate the ex- offender into the community and reduce recidivism. Auroraâs discharge planning
program has received an ESG allocation since 2009, used to assist ex-offenders. In 2015, Aurora
received a Tenant Based Rental Housing (TBRA) allocation of HOME funds to provide housing for five
households. A re-entry network of volunteers, established in 2011, meets monthly to engage all
systems, groups, and individuals involved with the re-entry population. The network goals in 2015
included: expanding membership to all systems & providers, expanding & strengthening existing
committees, and collaborating with the Homeless Healthcare Network to establish a âSobering Stationâ.
(2). Engage in an intensive information campaign affirmatively furthering fair housing. Use social
media and traditional media to reach a large part of the population. DMD spoke with the Human
Relations Commission to discuss a potential design for a media campaign/plan to affirmatively
furthering fair housing. The Human Relations Commission operates under City Ordinance to ensure
equal opportunity to all citizens; education, employment, access to public conveniences and
accommodations, and acquisition through purchase or rental of real property, including but not limited
to housing and the elimination on segregation or separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex,
disability, national origin, age, or ancestry, since such segregation is an impediment to equal
opportunity. The Commission advertises on a minority-owned radio station, WEOA âThe Pumpâ
providing public service announcements on where to file fair housing or discrimination complaints in
Evansville. Other activities include participating in the Family Day in the Park held on September 11 &
12th, 2015, designed to provide residents with service information, and provided a lecture during Fair
Housing Week on fair housing issues.
(3) Solutions for low homeownership among African American households
DMD received a response from Old National Bank (ONB) regarding mortgage and lending programs

specialized lending programs is committed to strengthening and focusing on community strategic
partnerships, including the African American population. Under the leadership of Old National Diversity
& Inclusion Director, an African American Associate Resource Group has been established with a focus
on outreach and engagement activities within the African American community. Programs provided
include; Home Manager Mortgage program -restricted to (LMI) first-time homebuyers who completed a
HUD-certified home buyer education program. Maximum financing up to 97% of the appraisal with no

HOPE of Evansville, Inc. instituted an anti-discrimination and personnel policy to ensure anyone in a
protected class receives the same level of services as anyone else.
The Evansville Housing Authority - adheres to current policies established by Federal, State, and local
laws.
Human Relations Commission Vanderburgh County, Evansville, Indiana all policies have been
strategically adjusted to ensure there are no barriers for protected individuals. The commission
commented that The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is offering more resources,
resulting in local jurisdictions using more tools to affirmatively further fair housing in communities. Once
the resources take hold, the public sector will have the resources to address segregated housing
patterns more strategically and effectively.

2011 CAPER

GENERAL

Assessment of one-year Goals and Objectives
During the year 2011 the City of Evansville effectively utilized its Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) and
Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds to undertake a wide variety of programs, projects and
activities designed to address housing and community development needs throughout Evansville,
especially in the Focus Area, Front Door Pride Area (for which the branding deleted the term
Front Door Pride Area in 2012, keeping programming the same, but broadening the scope of
assistance to eligible focus areas) and Jacobsville Neighborhood. This report, the Consolidated
Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER), will provide a summary of the
performance and accomplishments achieved as outcomes of the Consolidated Housing and
Community Development Plan and utilization of federal resources provided by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for fiscal year 2011. This consolidated
planning, application and reporting process was developed by HUD in response to local requests
for tools to reduce paperwork and address community problems comprehensively. The City of
Evansville used the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) to draw the funds,
and GIS software to provide maps.
Evansvilleâs 2010-2014 Consolidated Housing and Community Development Plan
complies with all planning requirements. The department uses the Five Year Action Plan as a
self-evaluation tool in CAPER reporting. The city continued to comply with citizen participation
requirements through the Citizens Advisory Committee and public hearings on Consolidated
Plan actions.
Affirmatively Further Fair Housing
In the appendices A Summary of Impediments to fair housing choice is provided
outlining the actions and five year benchmarks to resolve the fair housing issues. In 2010 the
City of Evansville and the Evansville Vanderburgh County Human Relations Commission
contracted with Engaging Solutions, Inc., a managing consulting firm to assist with the
preparation of the 2010-2014 City of Evansville Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing
Choice (AI). Through online surveys, public meetings, two workgroup meetings, and advertising
a thirty-day comment period in the Evansville Courier and Press and Our Times Newspaper, the
public was provided many opportunities to identify the fair housing impediments that exist in
Evansville, Indiana.
The City-County Human Relations Commission (HRC) is the agency responsible for
enforcement of Fair Housing Regulations for Evansville and Vanderburgh County. The city and
county jointly fund the Human Relations Commission (HRC) through general revenue accounts.
HRC staff attends fair housing conferences, conducts fair housing workshops, as well as
Page 4

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

investigates charges of housing discrimination. Presentations were conducted for property
owners and managers, community leaders, and housing professionals.
In 2011, the HRC sponsored fair housing month training on April 7-8, 2011. The guest
speakers were Stella Adams, Director of HUDâs National Fair Housing Training Academy and
Hollie A. Boyd, Jr., Esq., Lead Equal Opportunity Specialist HUD/FHEO. Ms. Adams and the
HRC executive director, Diane Clements, were also interviewed on WEOA radio show, Drum
Beat. The discussion focused on fair housing issues and provided listeners with information on
seeking assistance if they had reason to believe that their rights were denied.
HRC staff and commissioners attended the Indiana Consortium of State and Local
Human Rights Agencies Training Conference in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, June 28-July 1, 2011.
Several fair housing sessions were presented at the training conference by HUD representatives.
All three HRC Investigators attended HUDâs National Fair Housing Training Academy in 2011.
Fair Housing Outreach activities for 2011 included public service announcements on
radio broadcasts and newspapers educating the community on fair housing. Fair Housing
educational booklets and posters were distributed to the general public, community groups and
organizations.
The HRC also distributed fair housing information at Family Day in the Park on
September 10, 2011. Information was distributed on how to file a fair housing complaint.
The Analysis of Impedimentsâ Workgroup comprised of various organizations:
governmental and non-profit groups gathered on February 7, 2012, at Central Public Library,
from 1:30 â 3:30 p.m. to review the 2011 benchmarks. Listed are the names of the organizations
present and the results of the discussion.

Cost Burden: (1) acknowledge the need to increase opportunities for low skilled workers to
obtain the necessary skills and employment: Grow Southwest Indiana Workforce reported that
the organization distributes surveys to employers requesting input on the skills lacking from
applicants. In addition, a 3-5 week training class is offered on business ethics. (2) A second cost
burden identified was the need for a year-round utility subsidy program: Vectren reported that
the organization has a discounted energy program for Low-Moderate Income households where
clients are referred to the Community Action Program of Evansville (CAPE).
Decent, Safe, and Affordable Housing: (1) acknowledge the need for public and private
partners to collaborate on pursuing funding. Bank representatives from Old National Bank and
Fifth Third Bank reported that credit issues are a problem in lending. Downpayment Assistance
Programs are available through the Federal Home Bank. HOPE of Evansville and CAPE (2)
reach out to the landlord community to establish maintenance standards, ECHO affirmed that
landlord incentives are needed, Blackford Grove Neighborhood Association identified the need
to lobby State Legislature, Vectren recommended working with the Property Owner
Maintenance Association (POMA) and the Vanderburgh County Community Foundation stated
the need for preventive dollar resources (3) increase the permanent housing stock available to the
30% Area Median Income, the workgroups Blackford Grove Neighborhood Association and the
Page 6

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

City Disability Board identified the need for weatherization assistance, stating CAPE, had limited
funds and a waiting list. Vectren stated they have an Energize Program to assist with weatherization
issues.

ECHO Community Development Corporation reported that the aging housing stock is a
challenge. According to Legal Aid, A tenant cannot afford due process if evicted and file a
complaint against the landlord, resulting in landlords dominant the legal system when property
conditions are disputed with the tenants. The Evansville Housing Authority commented that the
Housing Quality Standards (HQS) are too strict for landlords
The Vanderburgh County Building Commission reported on following activities:
In April of 2011, the City of Evansville established ordinances that set the foundation of the
Advisory Board of Property Maintenance. The Board provides guidance to the City in matters
concerning the enforcement of building maintenance. The core objectives of the Advisory Board
are: A) To promote a better public understanding that substandard buildings containing
dwelling unites contribute disproportionately to neighborhood decline and the social problems
typically associated with such decline; B) To develop cutting-edge concepts for the abatement of
substandard buildings containing dwelling units; C) To promote the continuation of
neighborhood partnerships with the City of Evansville.
Also in April 2011, the City of Evansville established ordinances that created a Rental
Registration Program. The Rental Registration Program gives property owners an opportunity
to register their properties for $10 per unit, which allows them to take advantage of some of the
benefits and discounts the Building Commission offers. As an incentive under the Rental
Registration Program, property owners that participate will be granted an annual âlimitedâ
maintenance license to complete work by obtaining a building permit that otherwise would need
to be done by a licensed contractor.
Zoning & Public Policies: (1) acknowledged the need for the review of zoning and subdivision
ordinances that promote barriers to fair housing choice, (2) revisit the current zoning policies for
group homes/community residential facilities, the Metropolitan Planning Office reported that
there are no strict enforcement laws prohibiting the cohabitation of 5 of more unrelated persons
per household (3) City officials should review current fair housing laws and consider LGBT
inclusive anti-discrimination laws. In 2011 the City of Evansville amended the current antidiscrimination ordinance, adding Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, and Trans-gender (LGBT) as a
protected class.
Racial, Disability, and Low-Income Concentrations: In 2012, the third year benchmark
identified on the Analysis of Impediments of Fair Housing will be examined in more detail.
However, some of the issues discussed among the workgroup included the following: EHA
works with low-income concentrations at 30% AMI, facilitating question and answer meetings
with landlords, neighborhood organizations, and apartment associations. The Hispanic
Page 7

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

Organization of Latino Affairs (HOLA) stated that Latinos experience language barriers where
English is the primary language. As the result of this experience HOLA is now offering Spanish
classes to landlords and English and life-skill classes to the Latino community. Albion Fellows
Bacon Center reported that although the center is a short-term facility, many of their clients have
limited skills. The City Advisory Board on Disability Services stated that many transportation
impediments involving safety are grandfathered-in âwhere issues need to be addressed. The
board will be inviting members of the workgroup to monthly meetings to resolve some of the
issues.
Access to Credit: (1) host a roundtable with bank regulators to explore how to address the
lending disparities; Fifth Third Bank conducts a roundtable with local realtors, where the
following topics are discussed: LMI credit issues, non-traditional credit, Appraisals, Indiana
Housing Down Payment Assistance incentives, Burdens for appraisers, Refinancing issues, and
homeownership stability. Old National Bank reported that lending institutions must comply with
requirements established by the Fair Lending Exam (2) promote acceptable credit counseling
service standards, HOPE of Evansville and CAPE provide Down Payment Assistance and
Counseling to home buyers. Both agencies are certified HUD Housing Counseling Agencies.
Other organizations stated that some local churches and the Girl Scouts provide this service to
youth
Transportation: was not listed as an impediment in the initial Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing Choice. However, the lack of available public transportation does impede where some
people choose to reside. Listed are some discussion highlights: The City Engineerâs Office has a
complete streets policy for all users. Sidewalk replacement priority is given by the need and not
the want. The focus for now is replacing existing sidewalks. The Metropolitan Planning Office is
currently preparing a Bike/Pedestrian Study. The City Disability Board reported a sidewalk
observation to the City Engineerâs Office that the 3foot wide sidewalks were an impediment to
mobility transportation when the utility poles were repositioned

Leveraging Resources
Agencies receiving CDBG, HOME and ESG grant funds also apply and receive nonfederal funds for the activities described in the CAPER Summary Table. Some of the non-federal
resources include: United Way funds, foundation grants, corporation grants, church grants,
private donations, and fundraisers to address both housing and community development needs.
Sub-recipients of HUD funds are required to provide documentation of matching funds prior to
the execution of an Agreement with the City for federal funding.
Recipients receiving HOME funds are required to match 25% of a total project budget.
See the HOME Match Report in the Appendices for details.

Page 8

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

Recipients of Emergency Solutions Grants are required to match 50% of their grant
allocation from the City of Evansville. The Emergency Solutions Grant Section of the CAPER
provides a detailed outline of the ESG match requirements.
Currently, the Community Development Block Grant does not require a match, however,
all public services agencies applying for grant funds must demonstrate in their proposals that no
more than 60% of their total project activity will be dependent on CDBG funds.
Managing the Process
The Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD) continued as the lead agency responsible
for administering the Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships
Programs, and Emergency Shelter Grant funds through its Community Development staff.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program, Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing (HPRP), and
Community Development Block Grant-Recovery (CDBG-R) funds were also administered by
the Community Development staff in 2011. DMD was also the economic development arm of
the city, charged with Business Development, coordination efforts with Evansville Brownfields
Corporation, Historic Preservation, Redevelopment, and in 2011 Neighborhood Inspection
Services (NIS). DMD is empowered to develop inter-agency agreements and coordinating bodies
that can facilitate cooperation among the jurisdictionâs supported agencies. The department
continued to work with other organizations and jurisdictions that have a regional responsibility
for economic development, business, employment, and planning. Additional duties of the
department include: homeless services, working with neighborhood associations and groups,
monitoring all funded projects, environmental and historic reviews, and the preparation of
performance reports to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Citizen Participation
The City of Evansville utilized the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) in 2010, to
review the 2011 Public Service Requests for federal funds. The CAC process, historically, was
comprised of nineteen community representatives from Focus Council Neighborhoods, the
United Way of Southwestern Indiana, financial institutions, and other non-profit/community
agencies. The CAC held two public meetings for applicants to present their proposals and to
provide funding recommendations to the Mayor. The Evansville City Council also held two
public hearings to provide applicants the opportunity to present their proposals and for council to
make final funding allocations.
The 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan outlined a new CAC configuration where the
committee will be comprised of nine members appointed as follows: five
community/neighborhood representatives, two representatives from the United Way Allocations
Committee and two mayoral appointees. Recommendations made by the CAC are forwarded to
the Mayor for final allocations to be made by City Council.
DMD staff continued to work directly with neighborhood associations in the designated
âFront Door Pride Areaâ and âFocus Areaâ to establish criteria for the exterior rehabilitation
program as well as for approval for designs of new construction homes. In addition, DMD staff
continued to meet with the Focus Council monthly to update neighborhood representatives on
the progress of DMD activities and allow input from the focus neighborhoods.

Public Meetings conducted in 2011
March 10, 2011, the Department of Metropolitan Development conducted a public meeting
providing an opportunity for the public to respond to the Community Activity Progress
Evaluation Report (CAPER). The meeting was conducted for comment on the results of the
performance and outcome of agencies funded in 2010. No comments were made.
On June 6th, 7th, and 8th, Community Development staff provided mandatory training to subrecipients applying for grant funds from the City of Evansville, Department of Metropolitan
Development for the 2012 Plan Year. The training provided an overview of the Community
Development Block Grant funds, HOME Investment Partnership funds, and the Emergency
Solutions Grant funds. Information on each grant fund will provide each sub-recipient with a
foundation for maintaining compliance with the grant(s) regulations and City Standard Operating
Procedures related to the various programs/projects funded. Other topics included: National
Objectives, Non-Public Service Projects, Public Service Projects, HOME Projects, HOME DPA,
Monitoring, Contracts, and 2011 and 2012 Funding.
During the months of June, July and August 2011, a public survey of Housing and Community
Development Needs was conducted on the City of Evansville website located at
evansvillegov.org.
October 5, 2011, The Department of Metropolitan Development conducted a public meeting
providing an opportunity to comment on the 2012 Action Plan. The meeting was scheduled at
5:00 p.m. at Central Library, was advertised in the Evansville Courier and Press newspaper, Our
Times newspaper, and forwarded to Hispanic Organization for Latino Affairs (HOLA). No
comments were made at the meeting.
2011 CAPER Public Notification
This document is available free of charge to the public. We have also uploaded the CAPER on
our website, www.evansvillegov.org, for public viewing.
The availability of the CAPER for review was published in the Evansville Courier &
Press newspaper and Our Times newspaper, giving the public thirty(30) days to comment on the
report prior to submission to HUD (see proof of publication in Exhibit I). In addition, a public
meeting for the community to review the CAPER prior to submission and allow for written
comments will be scheduled on Monday, March 19, 2012, at Central Public Library, Browning
Conference Room A, and beginning at 4:15 p.m.
Citizens Comments â PENDING

Overcome Gaps in Institutional Structure
During the 2011 plan year, DMD continued to work to expand the type and variety of
agencies and groups the jurisdiction works with. Through the eligible,, Focus Area, and
Jacobsville Neighborhood DMD worked with developers, lenders, and non-profit groups to form
lasting partnerships that serve the jurisdiction beyond the plan year. Specifically, DMD:
Page 10

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

ï Continued to work with County Government to acquire vacant and abandoned property
through tax sale to be utilized in various neighborhood revitalization efforts.
ï Continued to fund and utilize local not-for profit organizations to provide the necessary
services to the community for housing and non-housing needs.
ï Continued coordination with the public housing agency to coordinate new construction
housing
The lack of financial resources to provide administrative and operational funding for notfor-profit housing organizations is a substantial obstacle. To address this obstacle the City uses
the maximum amount allowable funds (5%) of the HOME grant to support operating costs for
certified Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs) to increase capacity.

Monitoring
SUB-RECIPIENT TRAINING
On June 6th, 7th, and 8th, Community Development staff provided mandatory training to subrecipients applying for grant funds from the City of Evansville, Department of Metropolitan
Development for the 2012 Plan Year. The training provided an overview of the Community
Development Block Grant Funds, HOME Partnership Investments Grant Funds, and the
Emergency Solutions Grant Funds. Information on each grant fund provided each sub-recipient
with a foundation for maintaining compliance with the grant(s) regulations. Other topics
included: National Objectives, Non-Public Service Projects, Public Service Projects, HOME
Projects, HOME DPA, Monitoring, Contracts, and 2011 and 2012 Funding
Approved projects and activities were monitored by the Community Development
Section with the Department of Metropolitan Development. Each approved organization on the
2011 Grant Awards list was assigned to one of four Community Development Specialists.
Technical assistance and over-sight monitoring were provided to each recipient assuring that the
projects or activities are compliant with all applicable federal regulations.
When the federal funds were released by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the City initiated the execution of the 2011 Operating Agency Agreements with
each grant recipient. Important supplemental documentation included: the agencyâs updated
expense budget and completion timeline. In addition, each agreement was curtailed to the
specific activity, or project, and source of funding. Thereby providing adequate notification of
the requirements associated with the grant.
After the Operating Agency Agreements were signed by all parties, the 2011 projects and
activities were set-up in IDIS where project/activity numbers were assigned. A purchase order
was requested from the City Controllerâs Office reserving the funds for budget expenditures.
Upon receipt of the approved Purchase Order, A Notice to Proceed was sent to the agency that
funds could be expended and billed, including a copy of the monthly monitoring report form to
be provided to DMD no later than 15 working days after the first of each month. The monitoring
report provides monthly accomplishments and information for the project or activity.
First time sub-recipients receive more over-sight monitoring and technical assistance
until DMD is assured that the sub-recipient can manage the program goals and satisfy federal
compliance requirements at which point, monitoring is adjusted dependent upon the need of the
agency and at the discretion of the Community Development Specialist assigned the agency.
Other project and activity monitoring include Section 504 Reviews, Historic/Archeological
Reviews, and Environmental Reviews conducted by the Historical Preservation Officer and the
Environmental Review Officer.

During the 2011 year, DMD staff continued to meet with the local Focus Council (a body
of neighborhood association representatives from target neighborhoods) on a monthly basis. In
addition to the Focus Council meetings, Community Development Staff held fourteen public
meetings and ran one survey to obtain community input on the needs of the community. Subrecipients were required to complete a budget page indicating their goals for the coming year,
which is included in the Agreements for federal funding. Based on the goals established, a perunit cost is assigned. A monthly monitoring report must be submitted with each claim,
indicating the total number served or services provided. DMD staff multiply the per-unit cost by
the total served/services provided to determine the maximum reimbursement for the month.
These changes resulted in a more timely submission of claims as well as the jurisdiction better
meeting the community defined needs. In addition, all proposals for federal funds were rated
and funded based on the priority need for the community. Proposals for services that were rated
as a high priority were given first priority in funding.
Lead-Based Paint
Since 1991 the Evansville Vanderburgh County Health Department has been conducting
free blood lead testing, and in later years began providing the monitoring of property abatement
procedures. Data results are reported to the Indiana Health Department through STELLER
(Systematic Tracking of Elevated Lead Levels Across the Region). The Evansville Vanderburgh
County Health Department conducted 2249 tests on children under the age of six in 2011. Five
children had blood lead levels greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter and less than 20
micrograms per deciliter. Through a grant from the Indiana State Department of Health, the
Vanderburgh County Health Department purchased household cleaning supplies to create Lead
Hazard Cleaning Buckets and printed Lead Removal Guides for households where a tested
childâs blood lead level was not greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter.
The Evansville Office of Sustainability, the Vanderburgh County Health Department, and
the Department of Metropolitan Development drafted an Evansville Vanderburgh County Lead
Ordinance. The ordinance was not approved by the Evansville Common Council. The ordinance
was more stringent than the state and federal regulations in a few key areas: clearance
examinations required the approval from a licensed risk assessor or lead inspector, instead of a
visual clearance performed by a certified renovator. Property owners were required to provide
copies of risk assessments, lead inspections, and clearance reports to future occupants of a
dwelling and the Health Department. Property owners and agents were required to disclose the
nature and location of any lead identified, and un-remediated lead hazards prior to accepting any
deposit, down payment, or rent. A violation was planned to be applied to any person who sold,
rented, or leased a building with an identified, but un-remediated lead hazard if the building
would be occupied by a child less than 6 years of age.
In 2010, DMD Inspectors Terry Vogel and James Sands, were re-certified as HUD and
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Assessors, while the Neighborhood Inspections
Coordinator, Ron Beane became a certified Risk Assessor. Mr. Sands, Community Development
Property Inspector, oversees the compliance of all DMD grant-funded projects that require lead
testing and risk assessments. .

In 2011 there were 46 individuals, 6 Community Development staff, 2 CHDO staff from
Memorial Community Development Corporation, 27 Housing Authority staff, and 16
contractors, that became EPA certified receiving Renovate, Repair, and Paint (RRP) training
from Midwest Training Services through three- options for one-day training in Evansville,
coordinated by the Department of Metropolitan Development and the Department of
Sustainability, Energy, Environmental Quality (SEEQ).
Contractors must complete an application and become approved to be listed on the Cityâs
Contractorâs List for notice of opportunities to bid on federal projects. From the list the City and
federally funded housing development corporations requests bid proposals for projects. Prior to
participation, DMD must verify that each contractor is properly licensed, insured, not on the
HUD debarred list and RRP certified.

In the 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan, owner occupied housing for the 31-50% and the 5180% HUD adjusted Multi-family Income brackets were identified as two housing priorities. In
addition rental housing for very low income was identified as the priority need for housing.
Objectives are to improve the overall quality of housing stock and availability of affordable
housing located in the areas targeted for assistance and improved mechanisms for assessing
supply and demand. The following sections describe actions taken in 2011 to address the
identified needs and objectives.
As described in the City's 2011 Annual Action Plan, no public policies were found to be
excessive, exclusionary, discriminatory, or duplicative or to otherwise constitute a barrier to
housing affordability. The zoning ordinance definition of family does not limit the number of
residents related by blood, marriage, or adoption; nor does it limit it to five as the number of
unrelated persons.
Foster and maintain affordable housing
The City of Evansville provided Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and
HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME), and Neighborhood Stabilization Program
(NSP) funding to agencies providing affordable housing. The CAPER Summary Table (Exhibit
H) and the Priority Housing Needs Table (Exhibit G) both show that the City provided funding
for owner-occupied housing, rehabilitation of low to moderate income rental housing; and
homebuyer assistance through down payment/closing cost assistance and new construction and
rehabilitation of single family homes.
Analysis of barriers to affordable housing
Inadequate financial resources have made it prohibitive for most low-to-moderate (LMI)
income people to obtain affordable housing. A few financial barriers include: poor credit, no
down payment, and closing costs. In addition to the purchasing requirements, the inability to
save money for emergency and home maintenance repairs is and has been one of the many
causes for deterioration of the housing stock in the Front Door Pride and Jacobsville Focus
Areas.
The City of Evansville has joined forces with several local financial institutions and
HOPE of Evansville and CAPE of Evansville to offer LM- persons debt management, credit
counseling, and assistance with closing costs including the down payment toward the purchase of
an affordable home. Neighborhood Inspection Services (Code Enforcement) addresses
residential structures in the Focus Area that do not satisfy building code standards. Voluntary
compliance is the primary objective with demolition as a last resort. Non- compliance results in
judicial enforcement obtained through Administrative Hearing and Housing Court within the
Vanderburgh County Superior Court system.

2011 CAPER

In 2011, Neighborhood Inspection Services increased the number of property inspectors
from 9 to 11 inspectors to allow for more intensive monitoring in problematic areas of the Front
Door Pride and Jacobsville Focus Areas. In addition, lap top computers were utilized by each
inspector giving them access to necessary public information through the City server while out in
the field.
The 2008 initiative to develop a new Property Maintenance Code was enacted in 2009 to
replace the current municipal ordinances involving existing residential structures. The new code
addresses the entire property (i.e. surface covering, trash, weeds, fences, etc.) as opposed to just
the structure. Staff continues to distribute to the public, a âQuick Reference Guideâ booklet
highlighting municipal codes, including photographs of acceptable and non-acceptable exterior
standards. The department continues a stronger alliance with the neighborhood associations
through regular attendance, education, and involvement in their scheduled monthly meetings.
Based on the 2010 Census, the Hispanic population in the City has increased 46 percent
since the 2000 Census. There is roughly about 3,014 individuals that are Hispanic or of Latin
origin. Many of these individuals are very low income and have language barriers. In an effort
to reduce these barriers, HOLA provides English as a Second Language classes as well as
Spanish classes to community organizations assisting the public for a minimal cost or free.
Specific Housing Objectives
In 2011 the Evansville Brownfield Initiative worked extensively to settle the pending
lawsuit against the defunct Swanson-Nunn Corp., owner of a contaminated former industrial site.
In addition, Brownfield services were extended through work with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) on lead and arsenic remediation of the Jacobsville Superfund site and
Dream Park, which is owned by the Evansville Redevelopment Commission. The Brownfields
staff also worked through hundreds of environmental reviews and a foreclosure action on behalf
of the City/DMD.
A large amount of time and effort was expended by staff to complete details for the
Homes of Evansville project, which will provide 40 new homes for low-moderate income
people. The project design is a âlease to ownâ concept, per HOME regulations will be set up as
a HOME Rental Project for the HOME unit. This program is financed with private investment
and low-income tax credits, approximately 2% of the project will be financed with local
investment and HOME funds.
The Evansville Brownfields Corp. is an offshoot of the Brownfields initiative, that
organization purchased seven (7) properties and sold sixteen (16) parcels during 2011. Eleven
(11) parcels were sold/donated to non-profits to construct or rehab homes, two were sold for side
yards, two were sold to a private individual for rehab and one was donated to a church to expand
a playground.
Memorial Community Development Corporation Activities

The City also collaborated with the Memorial Community Development Corporation (MCDC)
for the Akin Park Initiative. Because of the historic significance of the park and the quality of
housing, Akin Park is one of the more desired areas in the Focus Areas in the near
downtown.However, many of the outlying areas are rapidly declining. Utilizing a combination
of HOME, CDBG, Local Affordable Housing Trust Funds, and NSP funds along with traditional
financing. Memorial is rehabbing four(4) single-family residences and constructing six (6) new
single-family units in Akin Park and the Glenwood Neighborhood. In addition HOPE is
rehabbing one historic single-family residence in Bayard Park area.

Improve public housing and resident initiatives
During 2011, the Evansville Housing Authority partnered with Aurora Inc. to create an
affordable housing project that will be known as Vision 1505 for the homeless. Vision 1505 will
create 32 units of supportive housing in a currently vacant factory. Exterior demolition was
finished in 2011 and the former warehouse building will be rehabbed in 2012. Occupancy is
expected to begin in the fall of 2012.
With repeated vandalism since 2006 when the property became vacant, the turn of the
century building provides no current value to the neighborhood. In its present state, it clearly has
a blighting effect on the community. Upon completion of the adaptive reuse 1, 2, and 3 bedroom
units with common area for services will be created. Due to the industrial look and feel of the
existing building, the structure is totally renovated converting the entire building into a
residential multi-family complex. Single story dilapidated additions, not original to the building,
are demolished. The project eliminates the blighting effect of the currently vacant and
dilapidated buildings. The new facility is designed to blend with the existing single-family
residences composing the majority of the neighborhood (the âProjectâ). The Project will be
operated based on a âHousing Firstâ model. The partners are planning a âself-containedâ
operation with supportive services offered on-site. Referrals to outside services are made as
needed. The housing is considered permanent. Yet, we encourage and support families to move
into other forms of permanent housing. As appropriate to their progress, circumstances and
goals, that may include homeownership.
HOME Match Report
The HOME Investment Partnership Grant Match Report is Exhibit A.
Affirmative Marketing - Outreach to MBE/WBE
The Affirmative Marketing Plan and Outreach to Minority and Women Business Enterprise
(MBE/WBE organizations are outlined in Attachments to the HOME Agreements for federal
funding. The attachments are enclosed as Exhibit E.
The City of Evansville and Vanderburgh County adopted a local Minority and
MBE/WBE ordinance in 2001, which required minority outreach in all contracting opportunities
with the City and County. This ordinance established the MBE/WBE Program and provided
guidance on the establishment of an MBE/WBE Utilization Board. Staff support for the

Page 18

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

MBE/WBE Program and MBE/WBE Utilization Board are provided by the City/County
Purchasing Department.
During 2011 the City/County Purchasing Department merged with the EvansvilleVanderburgh School Corporation (EVSC) to form a Cooperative Purchasing Organization
(CPO). In 2009 the MBE/WBE Utilization Board and legal advisors drafted proposed revisions
to the MBE/WBE ordinance to include the EVSC, among other revisions, and submitted to City
Council, Vanderburgh County Commissioners and the EVSC Board of School Trustees for
formal adoption.
The primary goal of the MBE/WBE Program is to create an environment that promotes
meaningful business opportunities, builds productive partnerships and nurtures successful
integration of MBE/WBE firms into the purchasing efforts of City, County and EVSC. The
Cooperative Purchasing Organization sponsors educational opportunities, networking events and
notice of upcoming bid/quote opportunities for local MBE/WBE organizations.
The City of Evansville publishes legal ads in the Evansville Courier Press and the Our
Times newspaper, an inner-city minority-owned newspaper, and HOLA seeking participation
from qualified Minority Business and Women Business Enterprises. The City of Evansville is
committed to achieving significant utilization of Minority and Women Business Enterprises
(MBE/WBE) in the community purchasing efforts. Goals have been established to provide an
atmosphere of equal opportunity for all venders to participate in procurement opportunities,
including the purchasing of products, services, and public works contracts. (See City of
Evansville Municipal Code 3.90.110-180) Pre-bid meetings are encouraged and DMD facilitates
these meetings along with notifying MBE/WBE contractors and encouraging their attendance.
The City of Evansville continues to publish ads requesting MBE and WBE participation
in the CDBG, HOME and ESG Programs and other federal programs.

On-Site Inspections of HOME Rental Units
Annually the assigned Community Development Specialist monitors each agency on an
ongoing basis through review of submitted reports including, but not limited to: Project Set-up
Reports, claims for reimbursement, Unit Reports, Inspection Checklists and Annual Reports.
Each agency is also monitored through on-site visits by the Community Development Specialist
during which the Annual Report, Inspection Checklist, Unit Report, etc. for each unit is audited.
For projects with more than five units Annual inspections of HOME Rental Units are conducted
by the agencies responsible for the units.
Physical inspections of HOME Rental Units are conducted by Jim Sands, Community
Development Property Inspector, in relation to the required inspections as outlined by the HOME
Rule and included in the City of Evansvilleâs Standard Operating Procedures for HOME-funded
Rental projects. For projects with 1-4 units they are inspected once every 3 years. Projects with
5-25 units are inspected bi-annually. Projects with 26 units or more are inspected annually.

Affirmative Marketing
Page 20

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

The Affirmative Marketing Plan states that the City will examine whether or not persons
from all racial and ethnic groups in the community applied for or became tenants of units that
were affirmatively marketed. While the Cityâs Affirmative Marketing Plan applies to projects
containing five or more units and requires deed restrictions on those projects, the City also
requires that every rental property assisted with HOME funds execute these same restrictions.
During 2011, thirteen projects contained five or more units and were required to follow
the Affirmative Marketing Plan: CAPE Senior Housing, HOPE of Evansville, ECHO Housing
Corpâs Lucas Place, ECHO Housing Corpâs Lucas Place II, ECHO Rental Rehabs, Memorial
Community Development Corporationâs Memorial Pointe (senior housing), Memorial Place,
Memorial Place II, Memorial Point II, Memorial Walnut Street Phase II, Walnut Town Homes,
Cedar Trace Apts., and United Caring Shelters. All agencies sign an Affirmative Marketing
Policy as part of their Agreement for federal funding (see exhibit F). All agencies using HOME
funds affirmatively market their units regardless of the number of units. Examples of their
marketing efforts include: posting the HUD Equal Housing Opportunity poster in their offices
and units, including the equal housing slogan or logo on printed materials, distribution of printed
material identifying their agency and services to banks, hospitals, HOLA (a local not-for-profit
organization for the advancement of diversity and the Latino culture) and other not-for-profit
agencies, attending information workshops and fairs around the area and accepting referrals from
the Evansville Housing Authority, area shelters, and other not-for-profits and agencies serving
our target population.
The City of Evansville has determined that CAPE effectively affirmatively marketed to
the individuals who normally might not apply because of their race, color, religion, age, sex,
handicap, ethnicity, or familial status.
The City of Evansville has determined that HOPE of Evansville effectively affirmatively
marketed to the individuals who normally might not apply because of their race, color, religion,
age, sex, handicap, ethnicity, or familial status.
ECHO Housing Corporation's Lucas Place Transitional Housing Project contains twenty
units of transitional housing for families. This project is located in a neighborhood with racial
characteristics of 90% of population is white, 6% is African American and 4% is Hispanic. Of
the twenty units available, four are rented to African-American families, one is rented to a Latino
family, one is rented to an American Indian/African American family and fourteen are rented to
white families. In addition to advertisements ECHO notifies agencies serving the low-mod
population of available units. The agency followed the affirmative marketing efforts as outlined
above for these units; however, selection criteria for clients of the transitional housing program
may force ECHO to turn some potential tenants away. ECHO Housing uses the fair housing logo
and/or slogan on all paperwork, advertisements and posters.
The City of Evansville has determined that the ECHO Housing Corporation effectively
affirmatively marketed the Lucas Place I and II properties , located at 408 â 422 Barker Avenue
and 120 W. Michigan to the individuals who normally might not apply because of their race,
color, religion, age, sex, handicap, ethnicity, or familial status.

Walnut Town Homes. Memorial is listed in the Renterâs Guidebook, a local apartment listing,
and the Our Times newspaper, a local minority newspaper; Memorial also uses internet
advertising in the local on-line apartment service. All ads contain the equal housing logo. The
racial characteristics of this area are 70% African-American, 29% white and 1% other. Of the
eighty-seven units available at Memorial Place, Memorial Pointe and the Town Homes, seventynine are rented to African American families, two to multi-racial families, and four to white
families. All eighty-five units are occupied and a waiting list is constantly maintained. Due to a
very low turn-over rate, Memorial has little need to market the units, and the current waiting list
is expected to fill any and all units that become available in the foreseeable future. Memorial
CDC uses the fair housing logo and/or slogan on all paperwork, advertisements, and posters.
The City of Evansville has determined that Memorial CDC made every attempt to
affirmatively market both complexes to the individuals who normally might not apply because of
their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, ethnicity, or familial status. Memorial CDC will
continue to attempt to affirmatively market their apartments.
The City of Evansville has determined that the Cedar Trace Apts. have effectively affirmatively
marketed to the individuals who normally might not apply because of their race, color, religion,
age, sex, handicap, ethnicity, or familial status.
United Caring Shelters has 21 SRO units of transitional housing for single men. Under
contract with the Evansville Housing Authority, these units are affirmatively marketed to the
extent possible considering the nature of the program. EHA displays the equal housing logo
and/or slogan on all paperwork, advertisements, and posters.

HOMELESSNESS

A priority need for homeless was identified in the 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan with the
objective to provide high quality homeless service programs that will fill the identified gaps in
our Continuum of Care system. The gaps identified included: transitional housing, chronic
substance abuse and high priority supportive service needs for individuals and persons in
families.
There is still especially a need for some type of transitional housing and support for
domestic violence victims. However, transitional housing as a category is expected to shift to
rapid re-housing and permanent supportive housing as the new solutions proposed by HUD
under the new Emergency Solutions Grant.
Unaccompanied single women were identified as an increasing homeless population in
need of emergency shelter and a new Single Womenâs Shelter was opened up by United Caring
Shelters at St. Anthonyâs that serves up to 21 single unaccompanied women for the night.
In the city of Evansville, there are at least 310 emergency shelter beds and 165
transitional shelter beds available for adults and children (these numbers do not include
additional beds utilized for overflow). This does not include overflow bedding and motel
vouchers used to house homeless people in addition to the regular band count. Plus there are 20
vouchers for homeless re-entry. In addition there are 67 permanent supportive beds in place.
In 2011, there were a total of 14 agencies in Evansville: nine agencies that actively use
Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) and five that do not. HMIS is a web-based
data collection system that tracks the nature and scope of human service. HMIS is designed to
capture uniform client level data over a period of time in order to understand the service needs of
homeless men, women, and children. The entry of data into HMIS is a requirement for most
homeless shelters and other service providers receiving HUD funding. In 2012, a new vendor,
Client Track, will be put in place for HMIS and full participation included non-DMD funded
homeless providers except for domestic violence agencies (exempt by law) is anticipated.
In order for individuals and families to be considered homeless in supportive service
programs, the category âresidence prior to program entryâ must have been answered as a place
not meant for human habitation, an emergency shelter, or a transitional housing unit. Residence
prior to program entry is defined as where a client slept the night before he or she entered the
program.
The following agencies fully reported client data into HMIS in 2011:

Continuum of Care
The Department of Metropolitan Development continues to encourage collaboration
among sub-recipient agencies in the development and enhancement of homeless service
provision. Homeless Services Council of Southwest Indiana (HSCSI) is the local participant of
the Indiana Planning Council representing the Evansville region.. The Indiana Planning Council
is the official representative body for the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care.
HSC identifies needs of the homeless population and develops the strategy to bring clients
through a process from homelessness to self-sufficiency. The goal of the HSC is for each
participant to place client needs above the individual programs provided by various agencies.
Bringing these providers together presents an opportunity to share resources and information and
to work together to reach shared goals. Each year, the HSC, through the Department of
Metropolitan Development submits a grant application for Continuum of Care funds as part of
the Balance of State application. Renewal grants include:

EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT
The relationship of the use of Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds to the priorities,
needs, goals and objectives as identified in the Consolidated Plan is summarized in the CAPERSummary Table (Exhibit H). The Homeless Section of this report provides detail about the goals
and objectives for addressing homelessness in Evansville.
The Consolidated Plan incorporates the local 10-year plan to end homelessness, titled
Destination Home, as the planning strategy to identify needs, goals and special objectives.
During 2009, the homeless commission and subcommittees continued the development specific
action steps to implement the plan. In the mean time, Emergency Shelter/Solutions Grant funds
are being used to maintain services already in existence. Those services included emergency
shelter, transitional housing and homeless prevention services.
In December 2011, HUD announced the second portion of fiscal year 2011 (ESG) money

Due to the prior yearâs unspent CDBG funding available and the great need for infrastructure
repairs and affordable housing in Evansville, as noted above in #2 and #5, a portion has been
reallocated for the Block Curb, Alley, and Sidewalk Program and new construction projects.
In addition, a portion of the CDBG Revolving Loan Fund as indicated above in #3, have been reallocated for the implementation of a Micro-Loan Program by Memorial CDC.

Efforts in Carrying Out Plan
The City of Evansville was successful in carrying out the planned actions described in the 2011
Annual Action Plan. The City pursued all resources, provided requested certifications of
consistency, and did not hinder implementation of the Consolidated Plan objectives during 2011.
Resources available during 2011 are discussed on page three and in Exhibit D.
As part of our Neighborhood Pride Infrastructure program, approximately 20 blocks of sidewalk
replacement was funded with Recovery Act Grant Funds. In addition, Recovery Funds were used to
replace an existing alley utilizing permeable pavement. The existing alley was composed of brick,
concrete and asphalt and was in very poor condition. The newly constructed alley is clean, functional
Page 29

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

and aesthetically pleasing. Permeable pavement is material with pores or openings which allow
water to pass through the surface and percolate through the existing subsoil. The alley is
approximately 575 feet in length and 14 feet in width and is located between Adams, Jefferson,
Second Street and Putnam.

Funds Not Used for National Objectives
No federal funds were expended for expenses not meeting national objectives.

Displacement and RelocationThe City of Evansville does not provide funding to projects that may result in displacement
and/or relocation due to the cost-burden associated with such activities. In the event that
displacement and/or Relocation are triggered, the City of Evansville will follow the Uniform
Relocation Act in providing these services.
Low/Mod Limited Clientele Activities
Activities, which serve a limited clientele not falling within the presumed benefit
categories, were: Tri-State Food Bank, Outreach Ministries, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of
Evansville.
Tri-State Food Bank, by nature provides nutritious food to homeless shelters, soup
kitchens and agencies serving low-income families. Tri-State Food Bank served 7,972 people in
just the Evansville shelters.
Outreach Ministries, by nature provides services to low-income persons for crisis
intervention. Outreach served 2,471 and provided match of $179,750. It is a safety-net program
for emergency assistance. It is located in the âDelaware Centerâ which was conceived as a multiagency service center for low-income needs. The Soup Kitchen, by nature, gives service to
people in desperate need. The location is across the street from the Evansville Housing
Authorityâs, Fulton Project housing development.
The Boys & Girls Club, The Fulton Project low-mod percentage is 75.4%. The area is
accessible to the majority of low-income neighborhoods and on the bus route. The Boys and
Girls Club has two locations. Both are in census tracts with high percentages of low and
moderate-income households. In 2011, 16,024 duplicated youth visited the facilities with the
majority coming from census tracts 11, 18 and 26. In these tracts, the percentage of households
classified as low and moderate income is 68.5%. The nature of the program is free youth
activities after school and during scheduled breaks (summer, spring break, legal holidays, etc.).
The types of activities are both recreational and preventive in nature serving at-risk children
whose families cannot afford to pay for similar activities.

OTHER PRIORITY NEEDS
The remaining priority needs identified in the 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan were also addressed
in 2011. The priority needs include: occupied housing for the 31-50% and the 51-80% HUD adjusted
Multi-family Income brackets were identified as two housing priorities.

Neighborhood Revitalization
In 2011, the Department of Metropolitan Development submitted an application to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development for a Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy
Area (NRSA) designation.
The benefits of the NRSA are described in amendments to the CDBG regulations at 24 CFR 570
which were published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1995 and updated in the Final Rule
changes published in the Federal Register November 9, 1995. They are as follows:
Job Creation / Retention as Low-moderate Income Area Benefit: Activities undertaken
pursuant to this strategy may be qualified as meeting area benefit requirements, thus
eliminating the need for a business to track the income of persons that take, or are
considered for, such jobs (24 CFR 570.208(a)(1)(vii) and (d)(5)(i));
Aggregation of Housing Units: Housing units assisted pursuant to the strategy may be
considered to be part of a single structure for purposed of applying the low and moderateincome national objective criteria, thus providing greater flexibility to carry out housing
programs that revitalize a neighborhood (24 CFR 570.208(a)(3) and (d)(5)(ii));.
Aggregate Public Benefit Standard Exception: Economic development activities carried
out under the strategy may, at the granteeâs option, be exempt from the aggregate public
benefit standards, thus increasing a granteeâs flexibility for program design as well as
reducing its record-keeping requirements (24 CFR 570.209(b) (2) (v) (L) and (M)); and.
Page 31

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

Public Service Cap Exemption: Public services carried out pursuant to the strategy by a
Community-Based Development Organization will be exempt from the public service cap
(24 CFR 570.204(b) (2) (ii)).
The overarching vision of the plan is to create an aesthetically pleasing urban residential area
where property values increase over time and economic stability by increasing neighborhood
retail, commercial and business uses in the existing commercial areas. This plan can be achieved
by viewing projects holistically, providing incentives for reinvestment using a traditional, new
urbanism neighborhood model, establishing creative flexible zoning, and executing the plan over
the long term.
The City will continue to explore a variety of homeownership programs in collaboration with
Neighborhood Associations, local financial institutions, Community Housing Development
Organizations, and other housing entities. Programs will include but are not limited to: employer
sponsored homeownership programs; new construction; down payment assistance; and
homebuyer rehabilitation.
In an effort to increase progressive, diverse, culturally sound, mixed-income neighborhoods, the
city will also provide incentives to attract families of higher income levels to move back into
areas currently considered âlow incomeâ neighborhoods. Through a variety of local funds as
well as the Neighborhood Stabilization Program(NSP) the City will provide down payment to
families and individuals who exceed the 80% AMI requirement under the HOME and CDBG
programs to purchase homes constructed with NSP, local funds, and private funding sources in
the designated area. These down payments will be provided as a direct subsidy to the buyer.
Neighborhood revitalization objectives are met through many of the other priority needs areas
including housing, code enforcement, public facilities improvements, redevelopment, economic
development, and public services.

The Jacobsville Area Community Corporation (JACC) is a coalition of partners seeking to leverage
renewal and long-term redevelopment to the Jacobsville area. The Jacobsville neighborhood is
roughly bordered by Division Street, Diamond Avenue, Garvin Street, and First Avenue. It
became a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation in 2002 but had earlier roots in meetings during the late
1990âs that included representatives of Berry Plastics, Central United Methodist Church, Deaconess
Hospital, ECHO Housing, the Jacobsville Neighborhood Improvement Associate and city government
(Dept. of Metropolitan Development and City Councilperson). The area has the advantages of being a
neighborhood with all the basic services for a sustainable community, major employers, a location near
downtown that could again become a desirable area in which to live, and a significant and powerful
coalition of partners to support its redevelopment.

Redevelopment, which was envisioned when an updated plan for the Jacobsville Redevelopment Area
was create in late 2003, was slowed when many properties in the area were found to be significantly
Page 32

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

contaminated with lead and arsenic. About 2005 the area became an EPA Superfund site, and JACCâs
focus for the rest of the decade was advocating the allocation of funds to clean up property in the area,
so it could be developed. Around 30 properties were cleaned up in 2007-08 and about 250 in 2010.

During all of 2011 JACC continued advocating for completing the clean-up, and its efforts were
rewarded. It was announced in the October that another 450 properties would be cleaned up in 2012,
prior to which the EPA would contract to offer a training course in hazardous materials handling,
through which local residents could qualify for jobs with the contractor. Also testing would continue for
properties in a still wider circle in early 2012 to prepare for cleaning up these properties in subsequent
years. JACC also worked throughout the year to make sure the EPA would record with the County
Recorder the properties that were clean to their standards, so this would show up in a title search in
future years. In December JACC was assure this would be done.

In late 2010 the JACC was introduced to a new type of grass-root planning called Comprehensive
Community Economic Development and enthusiastically pursued this in 2011. Its board met in February
with the staff of the Indiana Association of Community Economic Developers (IACED), who had led this
process in other Indiana cities, getting residents of a neighborhood mobilized, visioning for their future
and then implementing the steps of new community plans. JACC agreed to enter into an agreement
with IACED to guide the planning process in Jacobsville, using Habitat for Humanity of Evansville as the
local convening organization, following the success of theHabitat for Humanity of Evansville with

the Glenwood neighborhood revitalization initiative.

In the spring Habitat and JACC began meeting with representative of other community partners,
including several with whom Habitat had worked in Glenwood. Since April the coalition involved in the
Jacobsville Initiative (led by Habitat) has grown, as has the breadth of membership on the JACC board
with important new partners. In June 2011 the City of Evansville committed $100,000 for the CCED
planning process to develop a Quality of Life Plan for the Jacobsville Neighborhood. Through the last
half of 2011 various pieces of the process were put in place. The contract with IACED was signed in
November 2011, with of training for a first round of interviewing potential leaders among neighborhood
residents set to take place the first week of 2012.

DMD staff also began working with JACC in early 2011 to get plans in place to enlarge the
Jacobsville Redevelopment Area and let it serve as an economic engine for further development
in the rest of the area. Several meeting with DMD staff led to the Evansville Redevelopment
Commission deciding to assist the effort with a major grant from JRA TIF money to bring in an
urban planning team to lead in a new master plan for the enlarged redevelopment area. An
RFQ was developed during the summer, proposals sought in the fall and a selection process
completed late in the year. The Redevelopment Commission advertized an Request for Proposal
Page 33

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

seeking planning consultants to update the master plan in 2011. There were six respondents who
initially did interviews/presentations.
The top three after consultation did
interviews/presentations for the leading neighborhood group for the area, Jacobsville Area
Community Corporation (JACC). KKG, now called MSI+KKG, was by unanimous consensus
picked as the firm to update the plan. This planning process will also be done during 2012, with
JACC committed to making sure the two different planning efforts coordinate and complement
each other.
Smaller accomplishments during 2011 fo JACC were: Supporting and contributing to the
restoration of the fountain in Garvin Park, getting the city to acquire a historic arch and erect it at
the parkâs south entrance, beginning efforts to bring the Christmas parade to North Main Street
in 2012, and seeking a grant to erect and light Christmas decoration along North Main Street in
2012âall to build on Jacobsvilleâs strengths and enhance its image

Funding was provided to 5 neighborhood associations in the Focus Area and for a neighborhood
resource grant. Funding was used for expenses to keep neighborhood residents informed of
upcoming events and other relevant information. Twenty-nine (29) representatives from several
neighborhood associations, United Neighborhoods of Evansville and the Department of
Metropolitan Development attended the 2011 Regional Neighborhood Network Conference in
Dayton, OH. The City and DMD participate in collaborative approaches to neighborhood
revitalization including Evansville Police Department (EPD), United Neighborhoods of
Evansville, Focus Council, Culver Site Council, Evansville Police Departmentâs West and South
Sector Citizenâs meetings and Landlord Tenant Alliance meetings.
EPD West Sector Citizensâ Committee meeting monthly, except during the month of December.
The EPD West Sector has an area designated as an official Weed and Seed graduated site. The
Weed and Seed philosophy encourages a collaborative effort between the government and
residents to reduce or âweed outâ crime and restore or âseed inâ positive programs within the
targeted neighborhood area. There are currently 15 active neighborhood associations within the
EPD West Sector.
Historic Preservation/Redevelopment Activities
The City of Evansville continued to promote the preservation of historic structures and sites in
2011. DMD employs a full time Historic Preservation Officer to educate and provide technical
assistance to the general public, to conduct Section 106 environmental reviews, and to guide
federally funded rehabilitation projects. In 2011 the Historic Preservation Officer submitted 198
Section 106 Determinations, 13 Initial Reviews, and 4 Final Reviews. In addition to these, much
time was spent working on buildings located in Nationally Registered Historic Districts slated
for demolition. There were 7 buildings that required a declaration of Adverse Effect before they
could be demolished. This involves, documenting the adverse effect for the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) and negotiating a Memorandum of Agreement with the SHPO
AND THE Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. The Historic Preservation Officer also
answered more than 675 queries regarding historic preservation in 2011. The Historic
Page 34

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

Preservation Officer coordinates historic preservation week activities including an annual
banquet.
Redevelopment Activities
In 2011, the Evansville Redevelopment Commission (ERC)
ERC worked with the Indiana Finance Authority, who funded Phase I and Phase II
Environmental Assessments by Astbury Environmental Engineering for property located in a
former redevelopment area â Walnut Center (expired 2007). The City has owned the property at
252- 254 Canal and 508 SE 10th Street for decades and a portion of the property is a vacated
street. At the time of acquisition, there was an adjacent public housing facility called Erie
Homes, owned by Evansville Housing Authority (EHA), who used the ERC property as a
park/recreational area for the tenants. The park was known as âDream Parkâ. In 2007, EHA
vacated all tenants and demolished the entire facility. EHA planned for a multi-use project, but to
this date, the project has not started. The ERC continues to own the property and plans to
transfer the parcels to EHA once their project starts.
ERC matched a federal EDI-Special Projects grant for the renovation of the Alhambra Theatre, a
theatre located at the core of the Focus Area (50 Adams Avenue). The EDI grant was for
$200,000 and the local match was $200,000. The exterior of the building was targeted for this
first phase of renovations and was completed at the end of 2011. The renovation included
repairs to the roof, tuck pointing, rebuilding the front windows, repair to the marquee, and
restoring the entrance doors and ticket booth. The Historic Preservation Services Office
monitored this work
ERC planned and executed the building a âgreen alleyâ in the Arts District, also located in the
Focus Area. The alley was constructed of pervious concrete and will take an estimated 270,000
gallons+ of rainfall out of the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO). The project costs were
approximately $120,000 resulting in a cost of approximately $0.44/gallon for a âgreenâ or
sustainable solution to the CSO problem which exists in Evansville and alleviates a substantial
burden to the neighboring residents.
ERC transferred one (1) property, 418 Jefferson, to HOPE of Evansville, a Community Based
Development Organization, for the Homes of Evansville project as mentioned above as 40 units
of affordable housing located in the Front Door Pride area including one HOME-funded unit at
this site.
Greyhound and Indiana Landmarks (IL) - in 2011 the Redevelopment Commission (ERC) signed
a development agreement with IL for the restoration of the Old Greyhound Bus Station. The
First Phase of Project will be the exterior renovation and could be valued around $1Million.
Currently the ERC, the owner of the property, has just finished a Phase 1 Environmental
Assessment of the structure and will begin remediation of any lead and asbestos found on the
exterior or within the scope of the interior renovation.
The start of the renovation of the Audubon Apartment building located at 832 SE Riverside
Drive, at the corner of Adams Avenue and S.E. Riverside Drive, was significant preservation
news in 2010. In 2011, the project was completed and nearly 100% occupancy of the building.
Page 35

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

Bi-annually the Historic Preservation Services Office compiles a condition assessment for the
Old Post Office, located at 100 SE Second Street, for the Department of the Interior. The 2011
report documented continuing serious problems of water infiltration primarily in the location of
the box gutters. Also noted, were the lack of repairs on the tuck pointing, roof, exterior
windows, and painting, resulting from the previous developer losing their lease to the mortgage
holder. With approval from the City of Evansville, the bank transferred the lease to a new
developer and is working with the developer to address the problems.
In response to the demolition of a significant dwelling located at 800 S. Kentucky Avenue, on
the perimeter of historic Bayard Park, the neighborhood association approached the Historic
Preservation Services Office about establishing a limited local preservation area around the park.
Three neighborhood meetings were held to determine the neighborhoodâs wishes on this matter.
All that is left to do is to conduct a door to door canvas to get a final check on the wishes of the
property owners on establishing a local preservation district.
Public Services
A variety of public service projects were funded by the City of Evansville in 2011. The
CAPER Summary Table in Exhibit H lists each project and its accomplishments by the following
areas: neighborhood revitalization, public service, homeless, special needs/non-homeless, senior
programs, and youth programs.

2011 CAPER

SELF-EVALUATION

The City of Evansville performed a self-evaluation while preparing the CAPER. The
results of this evaluation are included in the narrative sections above. In addition to these
narratives, this section provides more information.
Indicators of impact on identified needs
The City uses monthly monitoring reports from sub-recipients as indicators of impact.
These reports identify numbers of persons served and provide detailed information about the
performance of the sub-recipient. The City utilized different indicators depending upon the
identified need and the project funded to meet that need. Public Needs Hearings and Public
Survey results are used as indicators as well.
Performance Measurement System
During the preparation of the 2010-2014 Consolidated Housing and Community
Development plan through public meetings and consultation with stakeholders a series of longterm goals were set. These long-term goals will be established under each category of need and
then a short-term (annual) goal will be determined. The short-term goals will also set
benchmarks for program outputs such as the number of jobs retained or housing units
rehabilitated on an annual basis. Outcomes for each activity will support the plan goals for the
need the activity is intended to fill. The institution of a unit cost ratio that can be used in ranking
and determining funding allocations and levels will also measure efficiency in the delivery of an
activitiesâ product or service. An example of a long-term goal for the five-year plan is:
eliminating homelessness, promoting a sustainable housing market of decent, safe, and
affordable housing and creation of economic fortitude. Several activities may support this goal
such as housing rehabilitation (homeowner rehab, homebuyer rehab, owner-occupied rehab and
emergency repair programs), down payment assistance, and public facility improvements. The
outputs of each activity produce an outcome that supports the achievement of plan goals. An
example outcome for homeowner rehab is an increased percentage of housing units in standard
condition or increase in number of owner occupied units resulting from down payment assistance
and can be measured and directly support the long term goal.
During 2011, DMD continued to utilize a performance measurement system to reimburse
agencies for expenses. A per-unit cost was assigned during the execution of each Agreements
for federal funding, and reimbursement was based on the number of individuals the agency
served.

Barriers to fulfilling strategies and overall vision
Page 37

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

The main barrier to fulfilling strategies is the lack of capacity for an agency to meet the
needs of low to moderate-income people. For example, housing providers focus on offering
affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing, but cannot satisfy the housing demands for this
need. The City of Evansville provided funding to twenty-six (26) agencies in 2011 including:
four Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs) and five Community Based
Development Organizations (CBDOs). More funding, including operating funds, are needed to
increase capacity, resulting with a decrease in the demand for affordable housing. These agencies
are working to fulfill the strategies and vision of the Consolidated Plan; unfortunately, we are
faced with the annual challenge of funding their requests only partially with increases in
reduction of funding over the last several years and more significantly in 2011. Increased
funding and better leveraged financing, combined with better inter-agency coordination such as
the Policy and Planning Council for Homeless Services are needed.
Overall status of grant programs
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Emergency Solutions Grant
(ESG) programs are currently operating in an adequate and timely manner. The Department of
Metropolitan Development has taken several steps to ensure a more timely expenditure of funds
for the 2011 Plan Year and subsequent funding years. staff has went to several HUD trainings
during the 2011 plan year to ensure more efficient implementation of projects, increase
compliance, and expenditure of funds; our demolition and rehabilitation activities have
significantly increased; and unobligated funds from prior years were included in the allocation of
2011 projects. In addition, our Community Development staff has reviewed all projects from
previous and current years for expenditures and clean up if necessary. With these changes, the
City is confident that timeliness expenditures will not be an issue in the upcoming years.
The status of the HOME Investment Partnership program is covered in the following
HOME reports section. A requirement is included in the Agreements for federal funding between
DMD and the sub-recipients of CDBG and ESG funds to submit claims for reimbursement on a
monthly basis. Activities and projects are continuing or complete as reported in IDIS. Using
IDIS to report program progress is essential when drawing funds down because it triggers the
Community Development Staff to activate the completed status in IDIS initiating the
affordability period for home buyers. The more accurate the information provided in IDIS the
more useful the data pulled from IDIS beomes. The CAPER Summary Table shows an
âUNDERWAYâ status for those projects that had not made their final draw by December 31,
2011. However, many of these projects were changed to COMPLETED when the final payment
on 2011 expenditures was made in early 2012.
Report expenditures differ from letter of credit disbursements
The only difference in expenditures would be a result of beginning/end of year
expenditures. City Controllerâs records are based on the issuance of a check to an agency as
opposed to the IDIS records, which are based on drawdowns. If the drawdown is not received
and deposited prior to the end of a reporting period but the Controller's Office has issued a
check, a difference will occur as the year end reports were receive.
Major goals on target

Page 38

City of Evansville, Indiana

2011 CAPER

The overall goal of the Community Planning and Development programs included in the
Consolidated Plan is to develop viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable
living environment and expanding economic opportunities principally for low and moderate
income persons. As discussed in each section above, the City of Evansville's goals are on target.
The relationship of the use of CDBG funds to the priorities, needs, goals and objectives
as identified in the Consolidated Plan is summarized in the CAPER-Summary Table. Maps show
that activities were concentrated in the low/moderate income census tracts.
Other Income
Activities generating program income in 2011 are listed in the Program Income Table.
Exhibit D summarizes sources of Program Income, loans and other receivables.
Rehabilitation Projects
A summary of CDBG funded rehabilitation projects is provided in the CAPER -Summary Table
(Exhibit H).
According to the 2000 census, 61% of the total housing stock in the city was built prior to 1960
and were built to comply with earlier, outdated building codes.(A map is included in Appendix II
focusing on the age of the housing stock in these areas) Many of these homes are located in
predominantly low-income neighborhoods. Because rehabilitation projects were required to
bring buildings into compliance with current building codes, many of these older homes have
been allowed to sit and deteriorate due to the high cost of rehabilitation. An ordinance was
passed in 2010, while the City is currently updating the Property Maintenance Code to
implement a new ârehab codeâ to address the rehabilitation of older homes in the Evansville
area. Additionally, a set of Design Guidelines for rehabs and new construction in the designated
area has been developed through community involvement with Community Development,
Redevelopment, and Planning staff support. In addition, various funding sources (local and
federal) will be available to assist property owners with the cost of rehabilitation on older homes.

AFFIRMATIVE MARKETING PLAN
(UPDATING)

2011 CAPER

AFFIRMATIVE MARKETING PLAN

The City of Evansville will inform the public, owners and potential tenants of HOME assisted dwelling
units by the use of Equal Housing Opportunity logo or slogan in press releases and solicitations to
owners, and in written communications to fair housing and other groups. Furthermore, the City will
require the owners of properties that contain five (5) or more HOME assisted housing units to
implement the City's affirmative marketing goal to assure that individuals who normally might not apply
for the vacant HOME assisted units because of their race, color, religion, age, sex, handicap, ethnicity or
familial status: Know about the vacancies; Feel welcome to apply; and Have the opportunity to rent the
units.

The owners of properties that contain five (5) or more HOME assisted housing units will be required to
carry out the following procedures:

1.

Informing the public, potential tenants, existing tenants and owners about Federal Fair Housing
Laws and Affirmative Marketing policies. Owners of HOME assisted projects that contain five
(5) or more units will be required to post signs with the HUD Equal Housing Opportunity logo in
each project building.

2.

The City of Evansville requires HOME property owners to sign Deed Restrictions which remain
in effect for the same number of years during which the project shall remain affordable to low
income persons, based on the level of HOME subsidy per unit. For rehabilitated units with a
total HOME assistance subsidy (acquisition and rehab) of under $15,000, the affirmative
marketing requirement shall remain in effect for five (5) years, from $15,000 to $40,000, ten (10)
years; over $40,000, fifteen (15) years. For new construction or the acquisition of newly

Introduction

The City of Evansville, Indiana is pleased to submit to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) its 2017 Annual Action Plan, the third year of the 2015-2019 Consolidated
Plan. Project goals outlined in the plan were determined in 2015 through citizens' participation at
eight public meetings where participants discussed community development and housing needs,
including the completion of a survey. On October 22, 2015, a public meeting is scheduled at the
Evansville Public Library â Central Library â Browning conference room âAâ from 5:00 -6:00 PM.
The Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) prepared by the Indiana Association of
Community Economic Development (IACED) provided a summary of the existing fair housing
condition in Evansville, with five-year remediation goals. The workgroup will update the AI with
proposed actions for 2016.
In 2014, a marketing plan of the public service area, Evansville, prepared by Bowens' National
Research provided housing data on the existing PSA and five submarkets; Central Area, Near
East, East, North, and West, including three submarkets of the Central Areas; Arts District,
Downtown District, and Jacobsville District. An update of the marketing plan was completed in
2016. Through the use of these tools Evansville will be able to carry out reasonable community
and housing goals with positive outcomes.
The City of Evansville, Indiana, (Evansville) is a Federal Entitlement city, eligible to receive
direct assistance from the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to use
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), and HOME
Investment Partnerships Grant funds. As a recipient of federal funds, Evansville is required by
HUD to produce a Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan. The Department of Metropolitan
Development is responsible for administering the Consolidated Plan.

AP-50 Geographic Distribution â 91.220(f)
Description of the geographic areas of the entitlement (including areas of low-income and
minority concentration) where assistance will be directed
The corporate limits of Evansville, Indiana is the geographic area where funded activities using Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG), Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG), and HOME Investment Partnerships
Grants (HOME), will be used to benefit its residents. All 2017 projects satisfy at least one of three HUD
national objectives: Low to moderate Income Benefit, Slum & Blight Removal, or Urgency Need. In the 2017
budget a majority of the activities serve LMI residents.
Direct benefit âIncome eligibility is based on the HUD median area income guidelines. A majority of the
funded agencies provide services in one of the twenty low-income census tracts listed below. However, the
clients of the agencies are not required to live in a low-income census tract to be eligible for services. Program
types that provide a direct benefit include: Public Service activities, Community Based Development
Organization activities, Direct Homebuyer Assistance, Tenant Based Rental Assistance, Emergency Home
Repair, Homeless Services, and Rapid Re-Housing. The 2017 funds allocated to direct benefit activities
include: CDBG: $1,132,714, ESG: $200,000, and HOME: $162,100.
Area benefit - must be located in a target area where at least 51% of the residents are low income. The
following census tracts satisfy the 51% residency rule: CTS:
1,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,19,20,21,23,24,25,26,31,32,33,and 37.02 . Listed are the 2016 activities that will
provide an area benefit to low-to-moderate income residence: NRSA infrastructure improvement located in CT
17, Code Enforcement sustainability of low income census tracts, DMD disposition sustainability of City owned
properties located in CTS: 11, 12, 13, and 17, DMD Focus Neighborhood Development located in CTS: 11, 12,
17, 25, and 26, including homebuyer and rental projects located in CTS: 14, 17, and 20. The funds allocated to
area benefit activities include: CDBG: $818,000 and HOME: $232,500.

follows:

2. A description of the guidelines that will be used for resale or recapture of HOME funds when used for
homebuyer activities as required in 92.254, is as follows:
The City of Evansville, Indiana uses the HOME Final Rule and HOME regulations as reference guides in
administrating the various homebuyer programs. The City of Evansville Recapture/Resale Guidelines were
provided to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Field Office in Indianapolis, Indiana

and are available on the City of Evansville website; http://www.evansville.in.gov/index.aspx?page=275
The City/DMD primarily uses recapture provisions when HOME funds are provided to a homebuyer.
Recapture Provision â When the real estate is sold below fair market value; the difference between the
fair market value and the purchase price plus reasonable closing costs is considered the direct subsidy to
the homebuyer(s). The amount does not include the cost of development (development subsidy).
Periods of affordability. The HOME-assisted housing must meet the affordability requirements for not
less than the applicable period specified in the following table, beginning after project completion. The per
unit amount of HOME funds and the affordability period that they trigger are described more fully in
paragraphs (a) (5) (i) (resale) and (ii) (recapture) of this section.
The City/DMD will recapture the balance of the forgivable mortgage in the affordability term, and prior to
the homebuyer receiving any net proceeds. Net Proceeds is the difference between the sales price and
the primary mortgage balance plus reasonable closing costs. The City/DMD will not require repayment of
the mortgage if no net proceeds are available. .The recapture agreement is satisfied upon receipt of any
HOME funds due, the lien is released and the affordability period terminates
Net Proceed Calculation Example- SALES PRICE â PRIMARY MORTGAGE BALANCE + CLOSING
COSTS = NET PROCEEDS
When the City uses Resale option:
1. When a homebuyer(s) purchase would result in resale where financial assistance was not required by
the homebuyer(s), the direct assistance would result in the HOME allocation amount provided to the
CHDO/Developer/Owner to develop the property.
2. When homebuyer assistance is a grant would result in resale.3. When a homebuyer unit cannot be sold
within nine months after completion; the unit must be converted to a rental unit would result in resale. If
new construction, then the affordability period changes from fifteen years to 20 years.4. When a
homebuyer purchases a single-family unit greater than one unit and less than 4 units.
3. A description of the guidelines for resale or recapture that ensures the affordability of units acquired with
HOME funds? See 24 CFR 92.254(a)(4) are as follows:
The city will recapture an amount that does not exceed the net sale proceeds from the sale of the
property. In effect, the city will recapture the amount that is still outstanding (based on the forgiven portion
above); however, not in an amount that is greater than the new sale proceeds. If there are no net sale
proceeds, the city would recapture nothing.
In the event only a development subsidy is provided to a home or the property has multiple funding sources
(providing homebuyer and/or development subsidy) and the other funding sources may be restrictive, the
city will utilize resale provisions in these instances. The property must be resold to an income eligible
household making less than or equal to 80% AMI. The homeowner will be allowed the sales price of the

37

home to be determined by the original cost of the home to be inflated by the consumer price index,
reflecting the sales price cap. The new ownerâs principal, interest, taxes and insurance, PITI, will not
exceed 30% of the homebuyerâs gross wages. This will allow for a reasonable range of homebuyers to
afford the property.
HOME-funded Rental Resale Provisions
All HOME-funded rental projects are subject to resale provisions as indicated in 24 CFR 92.252. If a
HOME-assisted rental unit is transferred or sold during the affordability Period, it must be sold with a
transfer of the Deed Retention and Promissory Note indicating the continued affordability period as
indicated. For rental projects the affordability period is as listed in the chart below. In the event that the
affordability period is not maintained upon transfer or sell of the property during the affordability period, all
HOME funds utilized in said project must be immediately returned to the Department of Metropolitan
Development and subsequently will be reported to the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).
Plans for using HOME funds to refinance existing debt secured by multifamily housing that is rehabilitated
with HOME funds along with a description of the refinancing guidelines required that will be used under 24
CFR 92.206(b), are as follows:
The City of Evansville, Indiana, by and through its Department of Metropolitan Development will utilize Part
92 of 24 CFR, Section 206 (b) Refinancing Costs when underwriting HOME Investment Partnerships
Program requests for affordable housing projects. A description of eligible expenses follows: (1) For singlefamily ( 1-4 family) owner-occupied housing when loaning HOME funds to rehabilitate the housing, if the
refinancing is necessary to reduce the overall housing cost to the borrower and makes the housing more
affordable. (2) For multifamily projects, when loaning HOME funds to rehabilitate the units if refinancing is
generates a reasonable cash flow, cash reserves for repairs, where the developer can maintain the units at
the HOME low rent/high rent limits. (3) DMD would review the management practices of the developer as
part of the underwriting process to determine if the long-term needs of the project can be met and that the
feasibility of serving the target population over an extended affordability period can be satisfied. (4) The
new investment being made will maintain the current affordable units, create additional affordable units, or
both. (5) specify the required affordability period of 15 years or longer. (6) Specify that the investment of
HOME funds may be jurisdiction-wide (7) State that HOME funds cannot be used to refinance multifamily
loans made or insured by any Federal program, including CDBG (8) Acquisition costs for unimproved and
improved real property. (9) Related soft costs, reasonable and necessary cost associated with refinancing,
or the development of new construction or rehabilitation of housing associated with HOME funds;
architectural fees, settlement fees, project audit costs, cost to provide affirmative marketing and fair
housing information to homeowners and tenants, funding an operating deficit reserve, staff and overhead
cost, relocation, etc.

Reference 91.220(l)(4)
1. Include written standards for providing ESG assistance (may include as attachment)
The Aurora homeless outreach team will do coordinated entry assessments, and the coordinated entry task
force that includes DMD, will make recommendations for housing placements. DMD is working with
Corporation for Supportive Housing on written coordinated entry policies and procedure for 2016.

The ESG Rapid Re-housing program staff will work with local outreach teams and local homeless shelters
to identify eligible persons who might best benefit from the rapid re-housing assistance. Once a
person/household is identified as homeless, their housing case manager will complete a triage tool to
assist in identifying all housing options most applicable to the household. Selection for the program will be
based on income, employment history, housing history, homeless status and ability to sustain their housing
upon completion of the program.
ESG recipients and other homeless providers will have MOUs with DMD as DMD becomes the
lead for homeless data in 2016. In addition, sub recipients will use a centralized triage intake point for all
persons experiencing a housing crisis in their service area. HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing
(HUD-VASH), VA Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, Shelter Plus Care program,
Supportive Housing Program and local shelters and transitional housing providers are all included as
housing resources.
2. If the Continuum of Care has established centralized or coordinated assessment system that

meets HUD requirements, describe that centralized or coordinated assessment system.
Since the Continuum of Care is statewide, the Indiana Balance of State will have a mixture of decentralized
and centralized. Locally we will start out partially centralized, and continue move toward a centralized
system with Aurora as the central point of contact.
Coordinated Entry will utilize a nationally tested intake assessment from the National Alliance to End
Homelessness. The Coordinated Entry task force meets twice a month to make recommendations for
housing placements and includes DMD. Monitoring will be done by the Standards of Care committee led
by DMD.
3. Identify the process for making sub-awards and describe how the ESG allocation available to
private nonprofit organizations (including community and faith-based organizations).
A key component in assuring the public service activities that are funded represent the needs and input of
the community a Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) has been created. The CAC is comprised of nine (9)
members of various backgrounds and experience associated with organizations such as the United Way,
Focus Neighborhoods, social service agencies and community representatives.
Appointed by the Mayor, the CAC is the first step of a three-tier allocation process for public service funds.
All public service proposals for funds are reviewed by the CAC, who makes recommendations to the

39

Mayor. The Mayor in turn makes recommendations to the City Council, who has final authority to allocate
CDBG, ESG and HOME funds. All meetings of the CAC and City Council for 2014 federal funds were
advertised and open to the public.
HSCSI is the local representative voting body under the structure of the Indiana Planning Council as part
of the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care. HSCSI made the official recommendation for Aurora
Inc. to be the subrecipient/subgrantee for rapid re-housing funds. Aurora was the only applicant for
FY2014 rapid re-housing funds.
4. If the jurisdiction is unable to meet the homeless participation requirement in 24 CFR 576.405(a),

the jurisdiction must specify its plan for reaching out to and consulting with homeless or formerly
homeless individuals in considering policies and funding decisions regarding facilities and services
funded under ESG.
The City of Evansville meets the homeless participation requirement. Local homeless providers make the
effort to include homeless participants in their planning and decision making process. Several local
agencies have employed current homeless clients and previously homeless clients on their staffs.
The Commission on Homelessness, which was created into the City Code Chapter 2.115, membership by
code includes a previously homeless person on the Commission. The Commission makes nonbinding
recommendations to City and County government, not-for-profits, or interested agencies concerning the
10-year plan to end homelessness in Evansville and Vanderburgh County and the issues concerning
homelessness in Vanderburgh County and the City of Evansville.
As stated at City Code 2.115.020 Membership.
1. The commission shall consist of the following members
A person appointed by the Board of Commissioners who was previously a homeless person at some point.
5. Describe performance standards for evaluating ESG.
The performance standards were developed in conjunction with the governing body for the Indiana Balance
of State Continuum of Care, the Indiana Planning Council on the Homeless by using the national standards
outlined in Section 427 of the McKinney-Vento Act, as amended by the HEARTH Act. Baseline
measurements for the system-wide objectives will be developed upon program inception by IHCDA using
the HMIS. A brief overview:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Decrease shelter stays by increasing rapid re-housing to stable housing.
Reduce recidivism of households experiencing homelessness.
Decrease the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness.
Decrease the number of persons experiencing Chronic Homelessness. Create new permanent
supportive housing beds for chronically homeless persons. Increase the percentage of participants
remaining for at least six months in Continuum of Care funded permanent housing projects to 86
percent or more.

This report was created using the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) new online eCon Planning Suite.  The system was created to support grantees and the public in assessing their needs and making strategic decisions by providing better data.

HUD requires its grantees, such as the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County Housing Consortium, to submit their Annual Action Plans, Con Plans and this report, the Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Reports (CAPER), in the new system.  

Additionally, the self-populating data reflects activities performed with grants awarded with Program Year 2014 funds, which were not available to the City until July 2014 and to subgrantees until August 2014.  The actual accomplishments and dollars expended reflect calendar year January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.  

PLEASE NOTE that some inconsistencies have been identified between numbers that populate in the report and actual data.  As the self-populating data cannot be edited, explanation is made throughout this CAPER where such discrepancies exist.

CR-05 - Goals and Outcomes
Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan.  91.520(a) 
This could be an overview that includes major initiatives and highlights that were proposed and executed throughout the program year.

In South Bend during 2014, a total of 102 households received help with housing issues: 86 were existing homeowners assisted with repairs, and 16 were potential homebuyers provided homebuyer education.  Low-moderate income homeowners received assistance with needed repairs through the following programs: SBHIP - 41 assisted; REAL Services' Caregiver Connection - 24 assisted; Rebuilding Together - 21 assisted.
The Community Homebuyers Corporation (CHC) assisted 11 households with the purchase of their first home.  
In addition, the City of South Bend supported neighborhood revitalization efforts through four major partners: two community development corporations - South Bend Heritage Foundation (SBHF) and the Near Northwest Neighborhood, Inc. (NNN) - as well as the Northeast Neighborhood Revitalization Organization (NNRO) and Habitat for Humanity of St. Joseph County.
SBHF has developed affordable housing for the residents of South Bend for the past 40 years.  SBHF currently focuses its planning and rehabilitation efforts in the Near West Side of South Bend.  Working with CDBG, HOME and private funds, they have made a significant difference in the revitalization of that area.  In 2014 SBHF completed the following projects:
  * Rehab of single-family home at 218 Chapin for resale to income-eligible buyer;
  * Rehab of two units at 301-307 Chapin for rent to income-eligible tenants;
  * ADA conversion of bathroom at Colfax Cultural Center, complete with chair lift;
 In addition, SBHF acquired the multi-unit structure at 905-907 Lincolnway West to be rehabbed in 2015.
The NNRO was formed in 2000 to strengthen and revitalize South Bend's Northeast Neighborhood. The NNRO continues to work with the University of Notre Dame on the development of Eddy Street Commons, a mixed use development containing commercial space, hotels, a conference center, mixed income condominium and single-family homes.  Thirty percent (30%) of the single family homes are reserved for low-mod income families.  In 2014 five (5) low-mod households received mortgage assistance through the NNRO's Mortgage Investment Program, funded with HOME dollars, allowing them to purchase homes in the area. 
The NNN has been improving the quality of life in the Near Northwest Neighborhood for the past 20 years. Using a combination of CDBG and HOME funds, the NNN focused efforts on the Cushing-Lindsey-Scott Street area.  In 2014 the NNN completed the following projects:
  * Rehab of single-family home at 628 Scott (Sold to income-eligible buyer)
  * Rehab of single-family home at 615 Cushing (Sold to income-eligible buyer)
  * Rehab of single-family home at 917 Lindsey (Currently listed for sale)
The NNN started the following projects, to be completed in 2015:
  * Rehab of duplex at 625-627 Cushing into single-family home
  * Rehab of single-family home at 719 Lindsey
  * Acquisition of 706 Harrison for replat with 917 Lindsey
  * Acquisition of single-family homes at 621 Scott, 626 Scott  and 717 Cottage Grove for future rehabs
Habitat for Humanity continues to be a strong partner in the affordable housing market.  HOME funding subsidized the construction of four (4) new construction homes in South Bend in 2014:
  * 2123 Irvington
  * 825 Twyckenham
  * 1727 Chapin
  * 617 N. St. Peter

    Table 1 - Accomplishments  -  Program Year & Strategic Plan to Date

Assess how the jurisdiction's use of funds, particularly CDBG, addresses the priorities and specific objectives identified in the plan, giving special attention to the highest priority activities identified.
During the 2014 program year, year five of the 5-year plan, the City of South Bend and the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium effectively used their Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME, Shelter Plus Care (SPC), and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds to undertake a variety of programs, projects and activities designed to address housing and community development needs throughout the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County.  High priority initiatives included owner-occupied housing rehabilitation, homebuyer assistance, slum/blight clearance, provision of public safety services, and technical assistance.  The accomplishments of the City of South Bend and the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium were consistent with the consolidated Plan's high-priority community development and housing objectives, and are presented in this report within the 2014 calendar year.
PLEASE NOTE:  HUD did not release 2014 funds until early July 2014, therefore the City of South Bend and St. Joseph County Housing Consortium were not able to contract with subgrantees until August 2014.  This left insufficient time in which to start, let alone complete, most 2014 CDBG, HOME and ESG activities.

 Table 4  -  Identify the geographic distribution and location of investments

Narrative
Based on data received from HUD for the NSP1 and NSP3 programs, the areas of greatest need in the City of South Bend were identified as census tracts 6, 4, 21, and 5, two of which are located in the Near Northwest and Near West Side neighborhoods. The City also identified census tracts 19 and 20 as areas of greatest need based on the data and the foreseen likelihood of foreclosures.  
Additionally, the geographic allocation of resources was based upon:
  * History of the City's focus/redevelopment and support of Community Development Corporations (CDCs)
  * Areas of need per NSP determinations
  * Location of most vacant and abandoned structures
  * High foreclosure rates (NSP)
  * Age of housing stock
  * High cost loans (NSP)
  * Completing the 5-year plan as outlined in the 2010-2014 Housing and Community Development (HCD) Plan
St. Joseph County
Given recent changes in the economy, the need for homeowner assistance has peaked.  To that end, 2014 HOME funds allocated to the County were directed to rehabilitation of a 25-unit rental property located in New Carlisle.
Leveraging
Explain how federal funds  leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds), including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any publicly owned land or property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the needs identified in the plan.
ESG match dollars come from a variety of sources including private donations, volunteer labor, and United Way grants.  HOME match dollars come from private donations, volunteer labor, land donations and waived fees/taxes.
In 2014 the City of South Bend's Community Homebuyers Corporation (CHC) awarded $158,070 of CDBG funds in Forgivable Mortgage Subsidy funds to eleven (11) families, enabling them to become homeowners.  These subsidies were leveraged with $643,630 in private mortgage funding.  CDBG provides the mortgage subsidy of 20%, not to exceed $19,000 of the purchase price of a home, and local lenders represented on the CHC board pool their funds to provide the remaining dollars.  CHC offers financing to clients that are usually not conventionally lendable.  Pre- and post-purchase counseling required for the mortgage subsidy program is a major contributing factor to its success.
Rebuilding Together (formerly known as Christmas in April) has aided homeowners in various neighborhoods throughout the community since 1989.  Rebuilding Together has built a strong relationship with the City of South Bend, local trades, the higher education community and the business community, allowing the program to grow stronger and more efficient every year.  In 2014 Rebuilding Together completed home repairs for 21 households in the Near Northwest  -  Lincoln Park neighborhoods of South Bend.  Rebuilding Together was allocated $200,000 in CDBG funds and it is estimated that donated labor and materials added $96,225 and contractor discounts an additional $1,090 to the project.

                  Table 12  -  Number of Households Supported

Discuss the difference between goals and outcomes and problems encountered in meeting these goals.
"Table 12 - Number of Households Supported" indicates the families and households assisted with PY 2014 funds.  That funding (CDBG, HOME, ESG) was not available to the City of South Bend, the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium, nor respective subrecipients until July/August 2014.  There was not sufficient time to undertake most funded activities in the remaining months of 2014. 
The PY2014 activities undertaken in calendar year 2014, and counted in the numbers above, were:  Rebuilding Together, Department of Community Investment Housing Counseling and ESG Shelter Operations for the Center for the Homeless, Life Treatment Centers, Youth Service Bureau and the YWCA.
Cumulative housing information is provided in the attached spreadsheets for each funding source.
Discuss how these outcomes will impact future annual action plans.

Narrative Information
Programs continue to concentrate on providing decent affordable housing and a stable neighborhood environment for low- to moderate-income people.  With a number of housing assistance programs, South Bend strives to help people in a variety of circumstances find decent, affordable housing  -  whether their need is for small repair grants, rehab/repair, homebuyer counseling on credit, how to work with a realtor and obtain a mortgage, down payment assistance or mortgage subsidies for existing or new houses.  In addition to the City's work, local CDCs continue to develop and build their own capacity.  Housing strategy and priorities have also been guided by the 2014-2019 HCD plan.
St. Joseph County - The Housing Assistance Office (HAO) coordinates most of the new and rehabilitation projects for affordable housing in the county outside South Bend and Mishawaka.  In 2014 The Housing Assistance Office (HAO) completed a new construction 10-unit senior housing rental project in North Liberty.  All units were leased to low-moderate senior citizens by year end 2014.


CR-25 - Homeless and Other Special Needs 91.220(d, e); 91.320(d, e); 91.520(c)
Evaluate the jurisdiction's progress in meeting its specific objectives for reducing and ending homelessness through:
Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their individual needs
The Continuum of Care (CoC) agencies worked together to design and implement a collaborative process based on referrals and complementary programs and services.  The process includes emergency shelter, transitioning to ESG or Supportive Housing Programs (SHP) funded agency programs, as well as working within the CoC to ensure specific client needs are met appropriately.  Case management services were available in 2014 to regularly assess the needs of clients. 
Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons
The CoC continued to discuss and work on strategies that resulted in the following priorities:
  * Restructuring the traditional shelter system toward the Housing First model and meeting Hearth Act priorities;
  * Focusing on rapid re-housing activities with ESG;
  * Using two distinct approaches, one for circumstantially impoverished homeless and one for chronically impoverished homeless, to re-house them;
  * Reducing the unsheltered or precariously housed population;
  * Reducing the time spent in transitional housing.
Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were recently homeless from becoming homeless again
The chronically homeless, severely mentally ill, veterans, persons with HIV/AIDS, victims of domestic violence, and youth were moved into rapid re-housing options rather than the traditional shelter system whenever possible. The chronic substance abuse homeless subpopulation used a traditional shelter model with expanded services and programs.  Pursuit of a large-scale permanent housing project for the severely mentally ill is ongoing. 
The CoC is also considering a facility for the chronically homeless who typically stay outside of the shelter system.  In 2014, a team applied to the Indiana Supportive Housing Institute for the opportunity to learn best practices for developing housing with support services. The intended project is a Frequent Users System Engagement (FUSE) facility to be located in the City of South Bend.  The team was selected to attend the Institute in 2015.
Helping low-income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely low-income individuals and families and those who are:  likely to become homeless after being discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions);  and,  receiving assistance from public or private agencies that address housing, health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs
The chronically homeless, severely mentally ill, veterans, persons with HIV/AIDS, victims of domestic violence, and youth were moved into rapid re-housing options rather than the traditional shelter system whenever possible. The chronic substance abuse homeless subpopulation used a traditional shelter model with expanded services and programs.  Pursuit of a large-scale permanent housing project for the severely mentally ill is ongoing.  The CoC is also considering a facility for the chronically homeless who typically stay outside of the shelter system. 
CR-30 - Public Housing 91.220(h); 91.320(j)
Actions taken to address the needs of public housing
The Housing Authority of South Bend (HASB) continues to provide the residents of South Bend the same high quality services as in previous years, despite undergoing a crisis in governance that led to the Executive Director's resignation and the Board being replaced.  A new Board of Commissioners is ready to assume responsibility for leadership and governance of the HASB.
Actions taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in management and participate in homeownership
The local Housing Authority participates in the Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS).  The FSS program is a voluntary program for Section 8 participants.  Additionally, for the past 11 years residents of public housing have participated in a similar program that combines the Public Housing Authority Sec. 32 Program with an Indiana State program of Individual Development Accounts (IDAs).  The Section 8 Program requires that the head of household enter a five-year contract with the PHA during which time the family will receive supportive services through a case worker with the goal of eventually not needing public assistance of any type. In return, any rent increases from increased income earnings that the participant experiences are placed in an interest bearing escrow account which the participant receives when they complete their contract.  This escrow account can be used for a down payment on a home or educational or medical expenses.  In the Public Housing Homeownership Program at the Housing Authority of South Bend (HASB) (now referred to as Section 32), since it was begun and initially titled Turnkey III, well over 100 families have moved from public housing to homeownership.
Actions taken to provide assistance to troubled PHAs
The HASB has appealed its rating of 56 on the PHAS. Should the appeal not be successful, the HASB would be receptive to any assistance offered. The HASB is preparing for the submission of its unaudited 2014 FASS. The HASB has scheduled its next round of physical inspections and is currently preparing properties for this inspection. The Board of Commissioners was replaced and a new Board is ready to assume responsibility for leadership and governance of the HASB. 
CR-35 - Other Actions 91.220(j)-(k); 91.320(i)-(j)
Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i)
The St. Joseph County Housing Consortium will continue to encourage efforts to expand the reach of the Human Rights Commission to the City of Mishawaka and St. Joseph County. Support for the development efforts that improve employment prospects for low/mod income individuals is ongoing.  Additionally, conversations are ongoing with the St. Joseph County Commissioners.
People returning to the community from prison often need assistance in securing jobs and affordable housing.  A movement to "Ban the Box" in South Bend may open up more employment opportunities for those re-entering the community from incarceration.
The Residential Tax Abatement program is available to potential homeowners for consideration when thinking about homeownership. This allows a phasing in the costs that can lessen the immediate financial burden and, coupled with the legislative property tax cap, could be critical to new homeowners.
The City of South Bend will continue its Housing Counseling and Homebuyer Education programs. Although not a financial mechanism, being better educated and understanding the costs and risks of homeownership can direct individuals where their situation best suits them. Understanding if and when a home purchase is a viable option is most critical.
Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs.  91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Allocations aligned with the High Priorities listed in the 2010-2014 HCD Plan and emphasized homeownership, public facility improvements, public improvements and technical assistance.  These remained the broader community priorities in 2014 based upon a number of issues:
  * Community need exceeded available resources
  * Slow economy / high unemployment depleted existing resources, while reducing donations
  * High rate of underemployment meant homeowners lacked income to maintain housing
  * High foreclosure rate was still a relevant issue
  * Large elderly population living in homes they could not maintain
  * Many issues including slow economy, unemployment, foreclosures can take a toll on a person's emotional and mental health.  These types of issues could be a contributing factor to abuse, addiction and homelessness.
South Bend's neighborhood revitalization focus became more urgent in recent years with the onset of the national housing crisis and the resulting number of vacant and abandoned homes.  This situation, coupled with an aging housing stock, created a challenging environment for neighborhoods and the community.  Complementary responses including public facility improvements, acquisition / rehabilitation, and demolition were seen as necessary and critical to achieving revitalization and assuring other investment, therefore resources were directed toward programs that addressed those activities. 
Another significant obstacle was the reduction of State funding and the lack of availability of State ESG funding to agencies serving the most vulnerable in St. Joseph County. There are no other resources to counter the reduction of these previously available funds. This can result in a reduction of staff which hampers the ability to provide service at the level anticipated and/or desired. The limitation of short term rental assistance dollars in the community as compared to the need was also a major obstacle. The economy and state of unemployment created a greater challenge as services were sought by even more individuals and families.
Members of the St. Joseph County Continuum of Care (CoC) attended meetings held by the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority (IHCDA) and voiced concerns about the reduction of funding from the State of Indiana. Written concerns were also submitted to IHCDA. In addition, CoC members meet with legislators to discuss the negative impact of funding cuts.
 Actions taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
In 2012, the HASB, in partnership with the County Health Department and with financial support from the City, County Commissioners, County Health Department, the Community Foundation of St. Joseph County, South Bend Medical Foundation, and Residence Inn by Marriot received a Lead Hazard Control Grant for the second time. This grant brings $3.48 Million in resources to the County to combat the relentless poisoning of children by lead hazards. As part of these resources, $180,000 is being used to focus on a physical and holistic approach to several additional home toxins and safety hazards in what HUD refers to as a Health Homes initiative. Over 140 homes are expected to have work done with 56 currently completed via the grant. Outreach and training have created more jobs by increasing the capacity of the certified contractors in the County by over three times the current level.  Over 120 personnel including 75 that qualify as Section 3 eligible (low income) have received training and certifications in Lead Hazard Abatement. The HASB partnered with local institutions and companies to access funds from other programs in order to assist families by completing much needed repairs in addition to the Lead Hazard Work.  The HASB will continue to accept applications and complete assessments in order to identify properties for the next LHCG Grant application.
The HASB maintains a Section 8 Landlord Assistance Program whereby any resident living in a Section 8 unit that is lead contaminated and the owner refuses to bring the home into a lead safe status, is given preference on the Public Housing waiting list for the first available unit.  With 2,124 Section 8 vouchers and a Housing Authority property 99.5% occupancy rate, these policies are seen to significantly increase the number of affordable housing units that are lead-safe in the City.  The HASB also maintains a listing of previous lead safe addresses at http://www.hasbonline.com/docs/safe.pdf.
Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty-level families. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Examples of the variety of mechanisms the community has employed to address poverty included the Center for Homeless STAR (Skilled, Trained, Able, and Ready) program which incorporated job readiness, externships, job retention, and job search assistance.   Another program that assists poverty-level families is Bridges Out of Poverty.  Bridges Out of Poverty is a local program based on a nationally recognized model that serves to educate both the low-income individual and the employer community on how to work together to address issues that prevent people in poverty from becoming employed. 
In 2014, the City of South Bend, in conjunction with the City of Mishawaka, the St. Joseph County Chamber of Commerce, IVY Tech Community College, WorkOne Development, and a number of local businesses launched a new workforce training initiative, "Supporting Manufacturers and Regional Talent" (SMART). SMART assists residents in obtaining the necessary skills to participate in a wider range of employment opportunities.  Participants are trained through IVY Tech as skilled workers in manufacturing.  Smart also merges various local employer advisory boards into one council to provide a unified local effort in job creation.  The program helps develop a skilled workforce to meet the needs of local manufacturers.
The St. Joseph County community was further committed to implementation of the low income employment provisions at 24CFR, Part 135 in the use of federal funds covered by Section 3.  To that end, the Section 3 clause was incorporated into each contract.  All public works construction contracts using such funds included Section 3 language as well.  In addition, Section 3 requirements were outlined during the pre-construction meeting for those projects. 
Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
Any targeted approach to a geography meshes the efforts of South Bend City departments, the CDCs, and other nonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity to broadly plan and advance the effort.  The CDBG, HOME and NSP funds targeted to the Near Westside, Near Northwest, and Northeast Neighborhood offered an opportunity for all of these entities to work together using their areas of expertise and educate each other on opportunities and challenges that will support the successful conclusion of the plan.  South Bend utilized a team approach to working with its partners in implementing the programs/projects funded through the various federal sources. The Community Development staff regularly communicated with all sub-grantees, and met with those entities involved in the targeted areas.  Regularly scheduled meetings with CDCs occurred due to the nature of work and amount of funds allocated.
Staff met with an entity upon approval of a project and prior to contracting.  In addition, desktop and on-site monitoring occurred regularly throughout the year.
St. Joseph County Housing Consortium members were continually informed of project/program status at their meetings throughout the year.  Scheduled early in the year, sub-grantees were aware and planned for visual and verbal updates to the Consortium.
The Continuum of Care, which includes the Cities of South Bend and Mishawaka, continued to meet monthly to discuss program status and funding opportunities, and to address the broader issues of homelessness and service in the community.
Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j)
1. Efforts to formalize the structure of the Continuum of Care, Board and membership are ongoing.  Monthly, as well as special topic CoC meetings, were held throughout the year. The CoC seeks to expand types of members to include developers.
2. The Public Housing Authority is a member of the CoC.
Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the jurisdictions analysis of impediments to fair housing choice.  91.520(a)
The St. Joseph County Housing Consortium prepared an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing (AI) in September 2014.  The following impediments to fair housing were identified in the AI:
  * Racial and Ethnic Minority Concentrations  -  the analysis finds that there is minimal racial and ethnic integration between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics across St. Joseph County and the Cities of South Bend and Mishawaka.  The presence of racial and ethnic segregation can present challenges to fair housing as segregation has been linked to economic and service disparities.
  * Individuals with Limited English Proficiency  -  a review of the languages spoken across the county showed significant diversity.  More than half of non-native English speakers reported speaking English less than very well.  Limited capacity to communicate can hinder an individual's access to housing and public services that promote fair housing.
  * Protected Class Status and Unemployment  -  significant variation was found in the unemployment rate of the county and cities across gender, race, and ethnicity. Unemployment can have severe implications for fair housing as it has real effects on disposable income for household expenses.
  * Housing Rental Costs  -  a disparity was found between the salary earned by minimum wage laborers and the fair market rent (FMR) established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The FMR for a two-bedroom apartment is $714, which would require a minimum wage laborer to work 76 hours a week to afford the rent.

  * Housing Affordability - a disparity also exists in the affordability of housing sales. Median housing values have increased while median income has decreased. This study also shows a disparity in the affordability of a house across race and ethnicity with the housing prices of the area.
  * Protected Class Status and Household Size - the majority of minority families have three or more persons within its household; however, the housing stock of rental units is primarily focused on one and two bedroom units. Lower rates of home ownership among minority households suggests that large minority families may have a more difficult time finding adequate rental housing with a sufficient number of bedrooms, which may result in overcrowding.
  * Opportunities to File Fair Housing Complaints - St. Joseph County and the cities of South Bend and Mishawaka have public ordinances to protect and enforce fair housing for its residents, including the point of contact for filing complaints. A lack of awareness to these contacts and a lack of consistency in the handling of complaints can lead to disparities in treatment across jurisdictions.
  * Unsupported Section 8 Vouchers - both the Housing Authority of Mishawaka and the St. Joseph County Housing Assistance Office (HAO) report waiting lists for Section 8 Housing Voucher assistance. Due to financial constraints the HAO has been unable to support all of the vouchers for which it has been approved.
  * Housing Authority of South Bend - during the study period, the Housing Authority of South Bend (HASB) was not available for interview.  Other interviewees referenced reduced hours of operation and services due to financial constraints and organizational problems. Internal problems within HASB can limit the access of residents to housing services.
  * Public Transit - the cities of South Bend and Mishawaka offer a public transportation service for its residents. Limited nighttime hours may restrict the commuting ability of second and third shift laborers and limited access to public transportation outside of city limits may limit the commute and access to services of low or moderate income populations that reside in the county.
  * Denial of Mortgage Applications - an impediment to fair housing can also be seen in the ability of lower income and minority households to gain home loans. The primary causes of denial were related to the household's income. The rate of denial for Blacks and Asians remains higher than the rate for Whites. Hispanic households were also challenged as their denial rate has increased.
CR-40 - Monitoring 91.220 and 91.230
Describe the standards and procedures used to monitor activities carried out in furtherance of the plan and used to ensure long-term compliance with requirements of the programs involved, including minority business outreach and the comprehensive planning requirements
On-site audits at local agencies receiving CDBG, HOME, ESG and NSP funds are scheduled per the HCD Plan, to ensure compliance.  On-site monitoring visits of sub-grantees are conducted at least every two years to review their internal systems and ensure compliance with applicable requirements.  A minimum of eight (8) on-site audits are completed annually.  The audits are performed by two DCI staff members working together to review accounting procedures and program rules.  These on-site monitoring visits are in addition to the monthly desk audits completed when reviewing subrecipient claims, constant communication on projects via phone and email, and various meetings to discuss program issues.  Each claim for payment submitted by a subrecipient requires a progress report relevant to the goals stated in the Scope of Services.  In 2014 the following on-site monitoring visits were conducted by staff, resulting in four (4) findings, two (2) concerns and two recommendations for follow-up visits:
  * Dismas House (1/17/14) - ESG
  * Center for the Homeless (3/12/14) - ESG
  * Housing Assistance Office (3/12/14) - HOME
  * Youth Service Bureau (4/29/14) - ESG
  * YWCA (4/29/14)  -  ESG
  * Housing Assistance Office (7/31/14) - HOME
  * Housing Assistance Office (11/5/14) - HOME
  * Near Northwest Neighborhood (12/11/2014)  -  CDBG, HOME
  * South Bend Heritage Foundation (12/18/2014) - CDBG
When the City of South Bend contracts with CDBG and HOME subrecipients, a memo is provided detailing the steps to take to engage M/WBEs. In addition, two lists of M/WBEs in St. Joseph County, one from the State of Indiana and one from Dun & Bradstreet, are provided to the subrecipients. During on-site monitoring visits evidence is requested that attempts were made to engage M/WBEs.
Citizen Participation Plan 91.105(d); 91.115(d)
Describe the efforts to provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on performance reports.
In accordance with regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium prepared a draft 2014 Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) describing the Consortium's accomplishments in housing and community development for January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.
The final version of the CAPER was available to the public for review and written comment from March 6 through March 20, 2015 at the following locations: all branches of the St. Joseph County and Mishawaka Public Libraries; the Walkerton Public Library, and New Carlisle/Olive Township Public Library; the City of Mishawaka Department of Community Development office; the City of South Bend Department of Community Investment office; and the City of South Bend City Clerk's Office.  The draft version of the CAPER was also online at www.southbendin.gov/caper.  Notice of the draft CAPER's availability to the public was published in the South Bend Tribune, the local paper of highest circulation, and El Puente, the region's Spanish language newspaper.
No comments were received regarding the 2014 draft version of the CAPER.
After formal submission to HUD on or about March 26, 2015, the final CAPER will be made available for public review at the above locations.  The final CAPER will also be available on the City's website.
CR-45 - CDBG 91.520(c)
Specify the nature of, and reasons for, any changes in the jurisdiction's program objectives and indications of how the jurisdiction would change its programs as a result of its experiences.
The City of South Bend has not made any changes to program objectives.  The goals of all programs still align with the priorities of the 2010-2014 HCD Plan.
 
Does this Jurisdiction have any open Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) grants?
No
[BEDI grantees]  Describe accomplishments and program outcomes during the last year.

CR-50 - HOME 91.520(d)
Include the results of on-site inspections of affordable rental housing assisted under the program to determine compliance with housing codes and other applicable regulations 
Please list those projects that should have been inspected on-site this program year based upon the schedule in Â§92.504(d). Indicate which of these were inspected and a summary of issues that were detected during the inspection. For those that were not inspected, please indicate the reason and how you will remedy the situation.
In 2014 all HOME-assisted affordable rental housing assisted that were scheduled for inspection were inspected.  The following facilities were inspected to confirm compliance with established housing codes:
Prairie Village Apartments (inspected 11/10/14)  -  5 of 25 residential units were inspected (these were the only units available for inspection).  Minor required repairs noted below, but all units passed inspection.
  * Unit 1: Water running in toilet
  * Unit 2: One missing smoke detector; one smoke detector missing battery; missing pantry door knob
  * Unit 3: Bath vent fan not working
  * Unit 4: Smoke detector not working
  * Unit 5: Smoke detector not working
Laurel Street Apartments (inspected 11/13/14)  -  1 of 2 residential units were inspected (the 2nd unit was not accessible for inspection).  Required repairs noted below, but the unit passed inspection.
  * Unit 1: No gas service.  Bonding wire needed on water heater. Cap the gas outlet in dryer area.  All GFI receptacles in kitchen need to operate properly.  Repair toilet second floor.  Check wiring on upstairs receptacles in east bedroom.
Shamrock Estates (inspected 7/01/14) - This is a new construction affordable rental housing development for senior citizens.  All ten units were inspected upon completion of construction.  All units passed inspection.
Provide an assessment of the jurisdiction's affirmative marketing actions for HOME units. 92.351(b)
The following language is included in every HOME contract executed between the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium and a subrecipient:   
"The Developer agrees to carry out the Consortium policy and procedures for affirmative marketing by the use of community-wide publications, approved Equal Housing Opportunity logo type or slogan in any applicable marketing of housing assisted with HOME funds, and by any other procedure delineated in attached Appendix III, "Affirmative Marketing Procedures".
Developers who are not in compliance with the above affirmative marketing will incur corrective actions as described in Appendix III (included as an attachment to this report).
Refer to IDIS reports to describe the amount and use of program income for projects, including the number of projects and owner and tenant characteristics
In 2014 the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium allocated $275,000 in program income to the Near Northwest Neighborhood, Inc. (NNN) and South Bend Heritage Foundation (SBHF).  Both CDCs received PI funds as part of their 2014 HOME contracts for acquisition/rehab/resale activities that will address the City of South Bend's vacant/abandoned housing concerns. The NNN is expected to complete three (3) rehabs; SBHF will complete one (1) rehab.  The rehabbed homes will be sold to buyers with household income at or below 80% AMI for St. Joseph County.  Buyers will complete eight (8) hours of pre-purchase counseling.
HUD did not release 2014 funds until mid-July 2014, therefore the St. Joseph County Housing Consortium was not able to contract with subgrantees until August 2014.  This left insufficient time in which to complete these particular 2014 HOME activities. 
Describe other actions taken to foster and maintain affordable housing.  91.220(k) (STATES ONLY: Including the coordination of LIHTC with the development of affordable housing).  91.320(j)
Activities such as acquisition/rehab, new construction on lots that have been cleared and re-platted, the redevelopment of foreclosed and abandoned homes, and providing tenant-based rental assistance to severely mentally ill individuals serves to foster and maintain affordable housing in the City of South Bend.

11.  Project Outcomes Data measured under the performance standards developed in consultation with the CoC(s) 
Using ESG funds, the City of South Bend and the St. Joseph County Continuum of Care worked to reduce the number of homeless households with children, targeting rapid re-housing and rental assistance dollars for assistance to families. To measure the success of the CoC members' rapid re-housing programs, clients will be contacted six months after their final ESG assistance to assess their housing status. The CoC set a goal that at least 35% of participants assisted remain in permanent housing six months after their final assistance.

Summary of Consultation Process

HUD specifies that this section describe how the recipient consulted with the Continuum(s) of Care on:

â¢
â¢
â¢

Determining how to allocate ESG funds for eligible activities;
Developing the performance standards for activities funded under ESG; and
Developing funding, policies, and procedures for the operation and administration of the HMIS.

The City of Evansville is part of the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care. The Indiana Planning
Council on the Homeless is the governing body for the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care. On
February 15, 2012, the City of Evansville officially attended the Indiana Planning Council meeting as
invited to officially collaborate with the Indiana Balance of State Continuum Care.

The City of Evansville has a strong continuous working partnership within the Indiana Planning Council
through Indiana Housing & Community Development Authority. The regional planning council under
the Indiana Planning Council structure is the Homeless Services Council of Southwest Indiana (HSCSI)
for the City of Evansville. All HSCSI are open to the public. At the January 13, 2012 meeting, HSCSI
recommended unanimously that Aurora Inc. be the subrecipient agency for the second allocation funds
for FY2011 dedicated to rapid re-housing. HSCSI represents homeless shelters and concerned citizens
and agencies interested in homelessness.

The Indiana Planning Council has four primary committees: Data Collection and Evaluation,
Funding and Strategies, Quality and Performance, and Housing and Program Continuum
Development. The City of Evansville ESG program will be part of the work of each committee.
Regionally, HSCSI has four primary committees: Data, Education, Standards of Care formerly
Evaluation, and Steering.
The City of Evansville ESG program will further the goals of Continuum of Care and further the
stateâs efforts to end homelessness by following established common performance goals by the
Indiana Planning Council. The guiding philosophies include a Housing First model for
homelessness solutions, the need for an effective outreach and triage infrastructure to prevent
homelessness and rapidly re-house individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and the
proven efficacy of permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing. The strategic objectives
of the Indiana Planning Council are to:
1

Decrease shelter stays by increasing rapid re-housing to stable housing.

2

Reduce recidivism of households experiencing homelessness.

3

Decrease the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness.

4

Decrease the number of persons experiencing Chronic Homelessness.
â Create new permanent supportive housing beds for chronically homeless persons.
â Increase the percentage of participants remaining in Continuum of Care funded
permanent housing projects for at least six months to 86 percent or more.

5. Decrease the number of homeless households with children.
â Increase the number of rapid re-housing vouchers and services.
â Increase the percentage of participants in Emergency Solutions Grant funded rapid rehousing that move into permanent housing to 82 percent or more.
â Increase the percent ate of participants in Continuum of Care funded transitional
housing that move into permanent housing to 70 percent or more.
1
Increase the percentage of participants in Continuum of Care funded projects that are
employed at exit to 38 percent or higher.
2

Increase persons experiencing homelessness access to mainstream resources.

3
Collaborate with local education agencies to assist in the identification of homeless
families and inform them of their eligibility for McKinney-Vento education services.
4

Improve homeless outreach and triage to housing and services.

5
Improve HMIS data quality and coverage, and use data to develop strategies and policies
to end homelessness.
6
Develop effective discharge plans and programs for individuals leaving State Operated
Facilities at risk of homelessness.

Summarize the public comments or views received; and
Summarize the comments or views not accepted and include the reasons for not accepting those comments or

A public comment period of March 20, 2012-April 20, 2012 was public noticed in the Evansville
Courier and Press and Our Times, as well as noticed with Hola. A public meeting on April 2,
2012 was scheduled at the Central Library that was open to the public. The Citizens Advisory
Committee (CAC) was invited to attend this meeting as CAC will be making recommendations
for FY2012 and FY2013 ESG funding later on this year in 2012.
As IHCDA for the Indiana Planning Council did in their public hearings/webinars, the public
meeting for the City of Evansville began with a video message from HUD Secretary Donovan
about HUDâs priorities for the Round 2 ESG allocation of FY 2011ESG and as follows below:
From HUD: HUD Secretary Donovan recently issued a video message directed to Emergency
Solutions Grants (ESG) recipients and subrecipients, Continuums of Care (CoCs), and other
organizations partnering with HUD to end homelessness. In addition to highlighting your
success in carrying out the Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP), he is
calling on ESG recipients to:

1) Invest an unprecedented percentage of your funding in rapid re-housing: Weâve
learned from HPRP that rapid re-housing programs make the biggest impact on
homelessness and should be given the highest priority under ESG.
2) Collaborate with CoCs: Keep planning smarter. Better coordination creates better
results for homeless families and the American taxpayer.
3) Focus on results and collecting quality data in the Homeless Management Information
System (HMIS): This data is essential to measuring what works and what doesnât.
Accurate HMIS data will also enable us to gain a more informed understanding of the
problems of homelessness in our communities.

Public comments and views received will be summarized here after they are received. The City
of Evansville intends to accept all comments.
This citizen participation process exceeds that required for substantial amendments under the
Stateâs Citizen Participation Plan.
Match

Describe:

â¢
â¢
â¢

Types of cash and/or non-cash resources used as match;
Specific amounts of resources used as match;
Proposed uses of match resources.

The City of Evansville expects to exceed the minimum match requirements for rapid re-housing.
There will be a strong emphasis on leveraging community and mainstream resources far beyond
minimal requirements for match to maximize the benefits to homeless participants. There is
anticipated to be more match and leverage for financial assistance made overall available to
participants long term due to partnering participants with Evansville Housing Authority and
other mainstream resources voucher providers.
Approximately a third of the match is expected to be match provided directly by participants or
on behalf of participants in the form of moving expenses, legal services, and credit repair
services. The second third is expected to be match provided by salaries and inspections. The
last third is expected to be match provided by the use and on-going support of Tyler-Munis
software for administration and property maintenance for the landlord registry, Indiana Housing
Now software provided by IHCDA, and mapping software.
Moving expenses will be tracked by Aurora per participant household and will be either the
actual cost of moving based on receipts or an estimate of volunteersâ hours at the HUD approved
in-kind value of $10 for each volunteer per hour as signed by the participant household. IHCDA
contracts state-wide with Indiana Legal Services, who provides legal services to homeless clients
when needed. Only legal services that are directly needed to house participant households would
be counted as match.
Salaries are expected to come from City of Evansville DMD that is paid out of general city funds
for ESG administration; City of Evansville Building Commission that is paid out of CDBG and
fees for inspections and the landlord registry; and Aurora for financial bookkeeping and outreach
that is not paid for by ESG funds.
The City of Evansville uses Tyler Munis software. The Housing Stabilization specific landlord
registry will be in-built into the Tyler-Munis platform and will be part of the larger Building
Commission landlord registry. All rental units that receive funds through the City of Evansville
must be registered with the City of Evansville landlord registry. Tyler-Munis will provide the
software and on-going support for the Housing Stabilization program. Indiana Housing Now is
an online manned housing locator service provided by IHCDA through a contract with
Socialserve. This also allows participants with special housing needs to receive specific detailed

housing recommendations to better allow scattered site services and give the participants more
and better informed choices for housing location. In addition, GIS based mapping software and
Google Earth will also be used to help participants physically plan their choice of housing based
on their natural resources; including location of housing nearby by workplaces, childcare, and
transportation.
In addition, starting in the fall of 2012, college students and university professors in the local
region will be utilized to help evaluate the rapid re-housing Program and to establish a model for
using local landlord registries for rapid re-housing that could be modeled and implemented in
other locations across the nation.

Proposed Activities and Overall Budget
Proposed activities.

â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢
â¢

All recipients must include the following details for each proposed activity:

corresponding priority needs from recipientâs Annual Action Plan
concise description of the activity, including the number and types of persons to be served
corresponding standard objective and outcome categories
start date and completion date
ESG and other funding amounts

1) Rapid Re-housing - Housing Relocation and Stabilization Services.
a. Corresponds with the following priorities from the 2011 and 2012 State of Indiana Annual
Action Plan:

â Reduce homelessness and increase stability for special needs populations.
â Expand and preserve affordable housing opportunities throughout the housing
continuum.
b. Housing relocation and stabilization services will include payments to housing owners, utility
companies and other third parties for the following costs: rental application fees, security
deposits that equal no more than two monthâs rent, last monthâs rent, utility deposits, utility
payments including up six months of utility arrears to support homeless individuals and families
in moving as quickly as possible into permanent housing and to achieve stability in that housing.
With the allocation amount of $118,314.97 (including $73,238 and $45,076 of FY11 Round one
ESG reprogrammed funds), the City of Evansville anticipates funding subrecipient Aurora as
recommended by the local planning council, HSCSI for rapid re-housing.
c. Corresponding standard objective and outcome categories: Supporting activities that improve
the range of housing options for special needs populations including homeless prevention and
rapid re-housing activities. Five year outcomes: 125 households 00000assisted as indicated on
the Non-Homeless Special Needs households chart from the strategic plan of the City of
Evansville Consolidated Plan 2010-14.
d. The anticipated start date for the rapid re-housing program is early June 2012, completion date
of December 2013. There is two years to spend ESG funds, however since the anticipated start
date is June 2012, the City of Evansville would like to keep the completion date of December
2013. This is consistent with IHCDA. The award term will be 18 months. Beneficiaries of the
program can receive up to 12 months of rental assistance and 18 months of housing relocation
and stabilization services.
e. 100% or $118,314.97 of the second round Emergency Solutions Grant allocation will be used
directly for rapid re-housing activities. This amount includes $45,076 of reprogrammed ESG
funds from FY11 ESG round one. Of that $92,513 will be set aside for housing relocation and
stabilization services.
f. Subrecipient Aurora also anticipates receiving funding from IHCDA for rapid re-housing in
the award amount of $325,000-$400,000. Funds if received from IHCDA would be combined
with $118,314.97 for a local rapid re-housing program called Housing Stabilization. This would
make the entire budget between $443,314.97-$518,314.97.
g. Since IHCDA has a percentage target of 35% for housing relocation and stabilization, the City
of Evansville plans to compensate with a much higher percentage of 78% to even out the
categories between the two funding sources for the local rapid re-housing program. Averaging
the two funding sources together, approximately 45% overall would be spent for housing
relocation and stabilization.
2) Rapid Re-housing â Rental Assistance.
a. Corresponds with the following priorities from the 2011 and 2012 State Annual Action Plan:
â Reduce homelessness and increase stability for special needs populations.

â Expand and preserve affordable housing opportunities throughout the housing
continuum.
b. The activity will include providing tenant based rental assistance to assist homeless
individuals and families to move as quickly as possible into permanent housing and to achieve
stability in that housing. The City of Evansville will develop an outreach and centralized intake
housing in partnership with IHCDA. No specific subpopulations will be targeted.
c. Corresponding standard objective and outcome categories: Provide tenant based rental
assistance to help stabilize 500 households during the 5-year planning period. Work in
partnership with Evansville Housing Authority.
d. The anticipated start date for the rapid re-housing program is early June 2012, completion date
of December 2013. There is two years to spend ESG funds, however since the anticipated start
date is June 2012, the City of Evansville would like to keep the completion date of December
2013. This is consistent with IHCDA. The award term will be 18 months. Beneficiaries of the
program can receive up to 12 months of rental assistance and 18 months of housing relocation
and stabilization services.
f. Subrecipient Aurora also anticipates receiving funding from IHCDA for rapid re-housing in
the award amount of $325,000-$400,000. Funds if received from IHCDA would be combined
with $118,314.97 for a local rapid re-housing program called Housing Stabilization. This would
make the entire budget between $443,314.97-$518,314.97.
g. Since IHCDA has a percentage target of 65% for rental assistance, the City of Evansville plans
to compensate with a much lower percentage of 22% to even out the categories between the two
funding sources for the local rapid re-housing program. Averaging the two funding sources
together, approximately 55% overall would be spent for housing relocation and stabilization.
4) Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS).
HMIS is provided and funded by IHCDA for the Indiana Balance of State and is funded by
IHCDA for the Balance of State.
a. Corresponds with the following priorities from the 2011 and 2012 State Annual Action Plan:
â Reduce homelessness and increase stability for special needs population.
b. Subrecipients are all required to participate in the HMIS system, as provided by Client Track
by DSI. Subrecipients are required to produce regular reports from the HMIS in conjunction with
HUD and IHCDA requirements. The subrecipients agree to enter data into the HMIS program
on a regular and consistent basis. I. IHCDA and the City of Evansville will monitor data entry
and data quality on an ongoing basis. We anticipate an estimated 100 participants will be
entered into HMIS for the ESG Rapid Re-housing program.
c. Corresponding standard objective and outcome categories: Supporting activities that improve
the range of housing options for special needs populations.

d. The anticipated start date for the rapid re-housing program is early June 2012, completion date
of December 2013. There is two years to spend ESG funds, however since the anticipated start
date is June 2012, the City of Evansville would like to keep the completion date of December
2013. This is consistent with IHCDA. The award term will be 18 months. Beneficiaries of the
program can receive up to 12 months of rental assistance and 18 months of housing relocation
and stabilization services.
e. IHCDA will fund the HMIS activity for ESG subrecipients in the Balance of State, including
the City of Evansville.

Discussion of Funding Priorities. Explain

why the recipient chose to fund the proposed activities at the amounts
specified (recommended: if available, use locally relevant data to support the funding priorities, and explain how the
funding priorities will support the national priorities established in Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent
and End Homelessness).Identify any obstacles to addressing underserved needs in the community.
In accordance with HUD, the State of Indiana, the City of Evansville chose to prioritize rapid rehousing activities with its second round of Emergency Solutions Grant funding based on the
experience of HUD administering the Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing program
(HPRP) and the demonstrated effectiveness of rapid re-housing. supports a housing first program
model.
Rapid re-housing was given priority over the homeless prevention activity in an effort to use the
funds as efficiently as possible to create a more impactful reduction in homelessness. It also
infuses the shelter system with additional funds to support more efficient and coordinated central
intake system. The addition of this rapid re-housing component allows shelter systems to work
more efficiently and expediently for those with the most urgent housing crisis. Additionally,
homeless prevention activities are much more difficult to reliably measure outcomes and
effectiveness, as well as to target recipients with the most need. In contrast, by using the HMIS
in conjunction with a rapid re-housing program, itâs possible to measure system wide outcomes
with more reliability.
A lack of short term rental assistance programs and adequate housing available to families
continues to be a major obstacle in addressing underserved needs in many Indiana communities.
The Indiana Permanent Supportive Housing Initiative prioritizes decreasing the number of
homeless households with children. Additionally, by using ESG funds to retool the homeless
response system, homeless services are being transformed to crisis response systems that rapidly
return people who experience homelessness to stable housing.
Detailed Budget

Include detailed budget of planned activities and funding levels accounting for entire second allocation and any
reprogrammed funds from the first allocation (may use Table 3 in the Notice).
See Table 1: Suggested Format for Declaration of FY 2010 Grant Fund Commitments and Table
3 of the Notice FY2011 Detailed Budget Table at the end of the amendment.
Written Standards for Provision of ESG Assistance

If the recipient is a state: include written standards for providing the proposed assistance or describe the requirements
for subrecipients to establish and implement written standards.
The written standards must include:

a) Standard policies and procedures for evaluating individualsâ and familiesâ eligibility for
assistance under ESG.
The City of Evansville is working with IHCDA and HSCSI as part of the Indiana Planning
Council to develop and coordinate regional central intake and triage centers to ensure access to
assistance is driven by the needs of persons experiencing homelessness. The ESG Rapid Rehousing program staff will work with local outreach teams and local homeless shelters to identify
eligible persons who might best benefit from the rapid re-housing assistance. Once a
person/household is identified as homeless, their housing case manager will complete an online
intake and assessment using the web-based Indiana Housing Opportunities Planner and
Evaluator (I-HOPE) triage tool to assist in identifying all housing options most applicable to the
household. Selection for the program will be based on income, employment history, housing
history, homeless status and ability to sustain their housing upon completion of the program.
b) Policies and procedures for coordination among emergency shelter providers,
essential service providers, homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing assistance
providers, other homeless assistance providers, and mainstream service and housing
providers.
Subrecipients will be required to create MOUâs with all shelter providers that receive ESG
shelter, essential services and homeless prevention funds in their proposed service area. In
addition, subrecipients will use a centralized triage intake point for all persons experiencing a
housing crisis in their service area. The I-HOPE tool will assist in providing a comprehensive list
of housing options appropriate for the household based on their responses to questions within the
tool. HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH), VA Homeless Providers Grant
and Per Diem Program, Shelter Plus Care program, Supportive Housing Program and local
shelters and transitional housing providers are all included as housing resources in the IHOPE
tool results.
Additionally, the City of Evansville has built the specific landlord registry for housing
stabilization into the City of Evansville Building Commission partnered with Indiana Housing
Now to develop a program design that is inclusive not only of other targeted homeless services,
but also of other mainstream resources such as public housing programs, programs receiving
project-based or tenant-based Section 8, Supportive Housing for persons with disabilities
(Section 811), HOME Investment Partnerships Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families (TANF), State Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, Head Start, Mental Health and
Substance Abuse Block Grants and services funded under the Workforce Investment Act. The
City of Evansville Building Commission landlord registry will not only be a positive screening
tool for housing stabilization for homeless clients, but also made available to special needs
groups that have specialized housing needs. The compilation of data into the landlord registry
maximizes client choice for homeless clients and special needs population. The Advisory Board
for Disabilities is partnering with the City of Evansville to maximize the information and the
client choice of the landlord registry to help those that have specialized housing needs.
The City of Evansville in partnership with IHCDA encourages subrecipients to be strategic and
comprehensive by requiring subrecipients to include all available resources and to leverage to
the maximum extent practicable.

c) Policies and procedures for determining and prioritizing which eligible families and
individuals will receive homelessness prevention assistance and which eligible families
and individuals will receive rapid re-housing assistance.
Homeless prevention will not be an eligible activity with the second round of ESG funds in fiscal
year 2011. Only those who meet the criteria under paragraph (1) of the âhomelessâ definition in
576.2 or who meet the criteria under paragraph (4) of the âhomelessâ definition and live in an
emergency shelter or other place described in paragraph (1) of the âhomeless â definition are
eligible to receive rapid re-housing assistance. Within this definition, a determination on suitable
participants will be based on factors such as income, employment history, housing history,
homeless status and ability to sustain their housing upon completion of the program.

d) Standards for determining the share of rent and utilities costs that each program
participant must pay, if any, while receiving homelessness prevention or rapid re-housing
assistance.
Rapid re-housing participants are expected to pay 30% of their income for rent and utilities.
IHCDA provides an Excel based worksheet which automatically calculates the tenant rent and
utility portion allowable household income is entered. Subrecipients will be responsible for
ensuring that assisted rental units meet rent reasonable standards, are below fair market rent and
meet habitability standards before any rental payments are approved. The tenantâs portion and
ESG subsidy will be calculated upon acceptance into the program and determination of need for
rental assistance.
The tenantâs portion of rent is calculated on the basis of allowable household income. Tenant
rents are paid directly to the landlord and are subject to the same timeliness requirements as the
overall rent. Any late fees incurred while receiving ESG Rapid Re-housing will be the tenantâs
responsibility to pay.
e) Standards for determining how long a particular program participant will be provided
with rental assistance and whether and how the amount of that assistance will be
adjusted over time.
Participants can receive up to 12 months of rental assistance per award year, and up to a maximum of 24
months of rental assistance in a three year period. The award term will be 18 months. Most participants
are expected to be serviced for six months or less. All funds associated with that award year must be
expended upon completion of the award term. All rapid re-housing participants must be re-evaluated for
eligibility at least once every year. Tenant payments will not be adjusted as income is increased. Payment
of rental arrears consisting of a one-time payment for up to six months of rental arrears, including any late
fees on those arrears is also an eligible expense. All persons assisted with program will qualify for up to
12 months of rental assistance and up to 18 months of services. Case managers, using the Arizona Self
Sufficiency Matrix tool on a regular basis, will work actively with participants to determine if less
assistance is needed or if income no longer qualifies them for program.

f) Standards for determining the type, amount, and duration of housing stabilization
and/or relocation services to provide a program participant, including the limits, if any,
on the homelessness prevention or rapid re-housing assistance that each program
participant may receive, such as the maximum amount of assistance, maximum number
of months the program participants receives assistance; or the maximum number of
times the program participants may receive assistance.
Participants can receive up to 18 months of housing relocation and stabilization services during the award
term. Participants cannot receive more than 24 months of these services within a three year period.
Housing relocation and stabilization services includes financial assistance activities such as moving costs,
rental application fees, security deposits, last monthâs rent, utility deposits and utility payments; and
services such as housing search and placement, housing stability case management, mediation, legal
services, credit repair. No limit will be placed on the amount or type of services provided per participant
as subrecipients are encouraged to spend the funds as needed by the tenant through active engagement
with the participant. The amount and type of services will be determined largely at the time of intake

when the housing case manager completes a housing assessment on the participant. The assessment
largely consists of using the Arizona Self-Sufficiency matrix tool, which uses a vulnerability index to
determine the most urgent needs as it relates to housing. This tool is also built into the HMIS.

Training in âhousing firstâ case management will be provided to housing case managers on determining
appropriate assistance levels and participant engagement. Participants can be assisted with housing stability
case management for up to 30 days during the period the program participant is seeking permanent housing
and cannot exceed 18 months total during the period the program participant is living in permanent housing.
Describe Process for Making Sub-Awards

HSCSI is the local representative voting body under the structure of the Indiana Planning
Council as part of the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care. HSCSI made the official
recommendation for Aurora Inc. to be the subrecipient/subgrantee for FY2011 rapid re-housing
funds. The recommendation is as follows below:
Whereas, the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP) was a one time special
funding made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA aka
federal stimulus funds.)
Whereas, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH
Act), enacted into law on May 20, 2009, consolidates three of the separate homeless assistance programs
administered by HUD under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act into a single grant program,
and revises the Emergency Shelter Grants program and renames it as the Emergency Solutions Grants
program.
Whereas, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implemented HPRP
as a pilot initiative for homeless prevention and rapid re-housing activities planned under the new
Emergency Solutions Grant.
Whereas, HUD has appropriated a separate award of Emergency Solutions Grant funds mandated for use
only as homeless prevention and rapid re-housing.
Whereas, the strict and very specific requirements for homeless prevention and rapid re-housing activities
require an independent and separately program for the City of Evansville and State of Indiana Region 12.
Whereas, Aurora Inc. was the sole subgrantee and provide of homeless prevention and rapid re-housing
funds as part of the HPRP program.
Whereas, there is a benefit of the continuation of experience that has been provided by Aurora Inc.
Whereas, Aurora Inc. is the only local agency with the capacity to carry out the homeless prevention and
rapid re-housing activities under the new Emergency Solutions Grant.
Now, therefore on January 13, 2012, be it recommended by the Homeless Services Council of Southwest
Indiana that Aurora Inc. be the subgrantee and provider of homeless prevention and rapid re-housing
activities under the new Emergency Solutions Grant for the City of Evansville and State of Indiana
Region 12.

Homeless Participation Requirement

For those recipients who cannot meet the participation requirement in Â§ 576.405(a), the substantial amendment must
include a plan that meets the requirements under Â§ 576.405(b).
Local homeless providers make the effort to include homeless participants in their planning and
decision making process. Several local agencies have employed current homeless clients and
previously homeless clients on their staffs.

membership by code includes a previously homeless person on the Commission. The
Commission makes nonbinding recommendations to City and County government, not-forprofits, or interested agencies concerning the 10-year plan to end homelessness in Evansville and
Vanderburgh County and the issues concerning homelessness in Vanderburgh County and the
City of Evansville.
As stated at City Code 2.115.020 Membership.
(A) The commission shall consist of the following members
(9) A person appointed by the Board of Commissioners who was previously a homeless person at

Performance Standards

The recipient must describe the performance standards for evaluating ESG activities, which must be developed in
consultation with the Continuum(s) of Care
The performance standards were developed in conjunction with the governing body for the
Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care, the Indiana Planning Council on the Homeless by
using the national standards outlined in Section 427 of the McKinney-Vento Act, as amended by
the HEARTH Act. Baseline measurements for the system-wide objectives will be developed
upon program inception by IHCDA using the HMIS; however system outcomes. IHCDA has set
for the ESG Rapid Re-housing program a minimum of five program standards. Three of the
standards are specific to the subrecipientâs program performance and the remaining two are
specific to system outcomes. The first standard on housing stability states at least 82% of Rapid
Re-housing participants will discharge to permanent housing. The second standard, centered on
increasing income, states at least 67% of discharged participants will increase or maintain their
employment or income upon exit from the program. The third program standard states that at
least 65% of participants will access mainstream resources while participating in the Rapid Rehousing program. The percentages are based upon the program performance of HPRP
subrecipients and HUD national Supportive Housing Program standards.

The final two standards establish system-wide standards for the Rapid Re-housing program. The
first sets a standard on the length of time that an individual or family remains homeless in the
City of Evansville. The average length of stay of participants in shelters included in the rapid rehousing program should reduce by at least 10%. The second system standard involves the extent
to which individuals and families who leave homelessness experience additional spells of
homelessness. Both of these standards were set based upon HUDâs stated performance targets
for a high performing Continuum of Care. The CoC will use the HMIS system to measure these
outcomes. Beginning on March 1, 2012, IHCDA will use an open HMIS system through the
vendor Client Track, which will allow the Balance of State Continuum of Care to establish a
baseline to track recidivism within ESG and SHP funded programs. During the second year of
the ESG, participants will be required to reduce returns to homelessness to less than 5% over the
previous year.
