right thank  colter   changed since  approval  given   conditions previously  regard  colter well   approval   subdivision   ingress  egress   wanting  know  now  need  take    access  peck road probably  good deal    come  comments  individuals     hard time finding  development  also   say   hard  get people back   show  homes  also  people   starting  buy homes   use  construction entrance   primary means        lot  direct  driving   neighborhoods   imagine   neighborhood like   much either  school gets started   probably count  least four cars   drive   neighborhood  use  construction entrance    people know  use   others  think  habits  already defined either   elementary     thats  way   going instead  coming  direction   probably purposely going toward  high school  middle school   thinking    deny access  peck road    group  people    going back   two  neighborhoods  think  majority   still  can  describe  development   school   traffic using peck road now   school   built    used      designed  load basically  line    buses  line   buses right    cant drive anywhere else   turn  come back  well  happens   improved      one lane  traffic  head back south    high school  thats      well  happened   buses instead  turning left going   way around  school  coming   entrance   come  make  right  baseline   come  peck road   drivers   buses drive back around  school  actually go  baseline   come  peck  know  thats one unintended consequence  occurred thats based  design  forcing traffic  go  peck   school want  begin      times   day   pull  traffic studies  speeds   average  miles  hour   posted mph except  school   session help    time line  condition  put     road  improved   school   sections   improvements    now     pavement   saw   video    guardrails   saw per  video    pretty rough road  wont deny    time   rough     now   pavement  markings  guard rail   addition   effect   road    drivers  narrowing effect  know   hundreds  roads    substandard  literally thousands  cars go  everyday just north  deaconess  neighborhood  just chopped full    basically one lane streets  cars parked   sides   day long  cars come  go   incident   part trying  get    condition got put    subdivision  probably  realistic  expect    school goes    completely expected  locate    peck road    part   improvement  just kind  smacks  something  right     improvements like     still come   around  peck road   buses  wonder     thought  widen peck    totally understand  traffic velocity  get   slow   wondering   school   now just    sheer volume  traffic    now        topic  conversation since researching   goes   way back     initial plat    developed now   completely different development    one   things   brought    time  peck road needed   improved    long     conversation  north high school  middle school ever even     know  two school buses can pass     road  believe   seen concrete trucks   delivery trucks pass     road   going slow     road forces    think   bad thing  think   something  acknowledge   say well everything     geometry  foot wide   bicycle lane  six feet  sidewalk  three feet  easement yeah    great     enough space  easement  county  make  happen anywhere  addition   already granted  front    property   cost two questions first   say   already got people using  construction entrance   unintended consequence yes   ones    winding  way   subdivision going   probably coming   peck  go   high school anyway thats  possibility  guess right   way  southbound exit  entrance  coming  old state   high school      monster truck  jump  curbs even   came   peck  headed south    development   never turn back   high school can      north though  can get   high school   north right  baseline road  can yes thats  point got people   subdivision    cant get    back     old state  baseline  coming  peck anyway right    second question  know    comments  vehicles  everything  developed  big lots      four lots back    currently zoned   just  way    set  right now    referring   three bigger ones  think   start looking  traditional neighborhood planning   approach     master plan    essentially    want     traditional neighborhood design  new urban principles behind   walking community   like  see    neighborhood grows either  shared green space  possibly   come  around  entrance    like commercial retail  mixed use space    getting  lot  positive response    talking  homeowners people buying   community people planning  buy   community   current zoning   right now    entire thing    done  accommodate  subdivision layout   condition stays       allowed  access   point somebody living   subdivision    go    get  old state   can go    peck road  much   want yes    point  still  get   anyway   point       day   got lost since  email came  john saying  peck probably needs   widened  north  baseline   guess  question    commissioner  asked  widen  yet     works   point  supposed      long story   basically   school corporation wanted  build    lobbied  commissioners  use  funds   baseline    went    going  use  funds  thought  peck road well finally  wanted  get  permits    two commissioners decided  go ahead  let    permits     took   money   school corporation  told     least improve  road    entrance   thats   came    money   fund right now    even   drawing board right now        passed  resolution  something     go back     said   widen  road  least  told  needed  go ahead  pave     can  putting  rock   stuff  make  better   people driving        condition   put

conversation  thats   going  happen       asked        try  help area plan  show     concerned  peck road   moved      roads  put    road  help      school kids anyway  basically  tried  work  area plan    get   money   thats  well  able      think  gotta replace  bridge  thats gonna cost   money  just wanted  make sure everybody knew   zoning       just  everyone  clear ms  questions turned    look   tires almost   white line    way  thing can go   gravel inaudible thats  going    ms   really  question     one   things  brought    school buses going side  side  passing   ms  either  can   cant  really  anything      anticipate school buses  come  go   entrance    thats  issue    point  right now   houses   six families living    lots  total traffic count   estimated      ms three
