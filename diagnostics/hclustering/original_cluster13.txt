Veterans Day
On December 7, 1941, tragedy struck our country when Japan bombed
Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

Many people died, were hurt, or were left in utter

despair, with no one to turn to - but the American soldiers were there. When our
country has been threatened with the many casualties of war, men and women
stood up and fought for us. These are the men and women who served in the
military: Army, Navy, Air Force and the Coast Guard. These men and women
are heroes.
When the country has been in its darkest moments, with its people
cowering in fear, American’s strongest and greatest people stood up to fight.
They fought for our rights. They fought against the horrors that others try to inflict
on us. They fought against all who try to put us in danger, and I personally thank
them for that. The honor they received is nothing compared to what they should
have received. You simply came home and then went immediately back to work.
Now, long past its time, we thank you; the citizens who selflessly put down their
lives for the people in our country. A million thanks cannot express the gratitude
our country should show to you.
As a child I was often praised for simple things; saying please and thank
you, getting an A on a test, making friends, etc.

But our heroes outshine

anything and A on a test could show. I’ve never had to fight for my safety. I’ve
never had to put my life out into the unknown. Everyone should strive for victory

and I think you have already achieved that. We need to thank you for all you are.
You are heroes, you are honorable. You are Veterans and I, on behalf of all
America, thank you. Thank you for keeping me and my freedom safe.

COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
(CAP)
Family or Child Sponsorship
Please consider sponsoring a family or child for our Community Assistance Program!
The process is easy!
1) Let us know how many children or families you’d like to sponsor by Friday,
December 2, 2016.
 Leave a message with your info at 317-571-2690, x7000, or
 Fill out our online registration form at http://tinyurl.com/Register-CAP, or
 Email us at CAP@carmel.in.gov
2) CFD match you with in-need children or families in our database who are located in
Clay Township.
3) Shop for your sponsored children or families.
 We hope to supply you with a "wish list" for each child and have it available to
you. If we can't get a list to you, then try to buy an age and gender appropriate
gift.
 There isn't any set dollar amount require; however, $60.00 per child could be a
good amount to consider. This is based on providing a child with an outfit and 2
toys. Spending above or below this amount is still acceptable.
4) Deliver wrapped & tagged gifts to Carmel Fire Department Station #41 Headquarters
prior to Tuesday, December 6, 2016.
 Gifts will be delivered with food for the sponsored families.
 Be sure to tag the gifts so they get to the right child.
 Do you prefer to personally make the gift delivery to the child or family you
sponsored? Just let us know! We will have food ready for you to pick up on
delivery day (Saturday, December 10, 2016 from 9-11am).
Some of the children will have wish lists and some will not. If they do not have a wish list, then
consider calling their parents for gift ideas. You do not have to get everything on the child’s wish
list; however, you can if you want. We ask that you choose gifts that would make opening those
gifts memorable and exciting for your designated child(ren).
Now you can cherish the thought that you helped make it possible to give a child or family a
memorable holiday season!

FINDINGS OF FACT - SPECIAL EXCEPTION

1.

Docket No.:

_______________________________________________

Petitioner:

_______________________________________________

The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community, in relation to
Ordinance, Section 21.3 (1-26) concerning the special exception because:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

2.

The use and value of the area adjacent to the premises under consideration will not be affected in a substantially adverse
manner because:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.

The need for the special exception arises from the applicant’s responsibility to provide public utility service, and not from any
condition peculiar to the premises under consideration because:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.

It will constitute an unnecessary hardship for the applicant if the special exception is denied, in that there are no existing or
approved towers or other structures in the vicinity of the premises under consideration which would be suitable for the collation
of the equipment that the applicant needs to locate in such vicinity, having regard to the following factors
(a) Whether the needed equipment would exceed the structural capacity of such existing or approved towers or
structures, as documents by a qualified professional engineer, and whether such towers or structures could be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the needed or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost
(b) Whether the needed equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of existing or planned
equipment at such existing or approved towers or structures, as documented by a qualified professional
engineer, and whether such interference could be prevented at a reasonable cost (Please attach appropriate
statements)
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.

The approval of the special exception does not interfere substantially with the Comprehensive Plan, in that there are no
alternative sites suitable (having regard to the factors listed above in item 4 for the equipment that the applicant needs to
locate in the vicinity which are located either in Business, Industrial, or Manufacturing Districts, or on property outside of the
jurisdiction or otherwise exempt from the requirements and procedures of the Zoning Ordinance because:
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________

DECISION
____Yes ____No: The Board has reviewed the requirements of Ordinance, Section 21.04.02 as they relate to this Special Exception,
and does not find that those criteria prevent the granting of the Special Exception.
IT IS THEREFORE the decision of the Carmel Board of Zoning Appeals that Special Exception Docket No. ____________________ is
granted, subject to any conditions stated in the minutes of this Board, which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part
hereof.
Adopted this _______ day of _____________________, 20 ____.
