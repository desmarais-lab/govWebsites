City of Carmel: Plan B
Summary of Benefits and Coverage: What this Plan Covers & What it Costs

Coverage Period: 01/01/2017 - 12/31/2017
Coverage for: Individual/Family | Plan Type: PPO

This is only a summary. If you want more detail about your coverage and costs, you can get the complete terms in the policy or plan
document at www.anthem.com or by calling 1-844-453-4508.
Important Questions

What is the overall
deductible?

Are there other
deductibles for specific
services?

Is there an out–of–pocket
limit on my expenses?

What is not included in
the out–of–pocket limit?

Answers
$750 Individual/$1,500 Family for
Preferred Providers.
$1,500 Individual/$3,000 Family
for Non-Preferred Providers.
Preferred Provider and NonPreferred Provider deductibles are
combined. Satisfying one helps satisfy
the other.
No.
Yes. $1,500 Individual/$3,000
Family for Preferred Providers.
$3,000 Individual/$6,000 Family
for Non-Preferred Providers.
Preferred Provider and NonPreferred Provider out-of-pocket are
combined. Satisfying one helps satisfy
the other.
Penalties incurred for failing to obtain
precertification/utilization review,
Premiums, Balance-billed charges and
Health care this plan doesn’t cover.

Why this Matters:
You must pay all the costs up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to
pay for covered services you use. Check your policy or plan document to see when
the deductible starts over (usually, but not always, January 1st). See the chart
starting on page 2 for how much you pay for covered services after you meet the
deductible.
You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see the chart
starting on page 2 for other costs for services this plan covers.

The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay during a coverage period
(usually one year) for your share of the cost of covered services. This limit helps
you plan for health care expenses.

Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out–of–pocket
limit.

Is there an overall annual
limit on what the plan
pays?

No.

The chart starting on page 2 describes any limits on what the plan will pay for
specific covered services, such as office visits.

Does this plan use a
network of providers?

Yes. See www.anthem.com or call
1-844-453-4508 for a list of Preferred
Providers.

If you use an in-network doctor or other health care provider, this plan will pay
some or all of the costs of covered services. Be aware, your in-network doctor or
hospital may use an out-of-network provider for some services. Plans use the
term in-network, preferred, or participating for providers in their network. See
the chart starting on page 2 for how this plan pays different kinds of providers.

Questions: Call 1-844-453-4508 or visit us at www.anthem.com.
If you aren’t clear about any of the underlined terms used in this form, see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary
at www.anthem.com or call 1-844-453-4508 to request a copy.

Do I need a referral to see
a specialist?
Are there services this
plan doesn’t cover?

No. You don’t need a referral to see a
specialist.

You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.

Yes.

Some of the services this plan doesn’t cover are listed on page 7. See your policy
or plan document for additional information about excluded services.

 Copayments are fixed dollar amounts (for example, $15) you pay for covered health care, usually when you receive the service.
 Coinsurance is your share of the costs of a covered service, calculated as a percent of the allowed amount for the service. For example, if

the plan’s allowed amount for an overnight hospital stay is $1,000, your coinsurance payment of 20% would be $200. This may change if
you haven’t met your deductible.
 The amount the plan pays for covered services is based on the allowed amount. If an out-of-network provider charges more than the
allowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. For example, if an out-of-network hospital charges $1,500 for an overnight stay and
the allowed amount is $1,000, you may have to pay the $500 difference. (This is called balance billing.)
 This plan may encourage you to use Preferred providers by charging you lower deductibles, copayments and coinsurance amounts.

Your Rights to Continue Coverage:
If you lose coverage under the plan, then, depending upon the circumstances, Federal and State laws may provide protections that allow you to keep health
coverage. Any such rights may be limited in duration and will require you to pay a premium, which may be significantly higher than the premium you pay
while covered under the plan. Other limitations on your rights to continue coverage may also apply.
For more information on your rights to continue coverage, contact the plan at 1-844-453-4508. You may also contact your state insurance department, the
U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration at 1-866-444-3272 or www.dol.gov/ebsa, or the U.S. Department of Health and

Examples:
These examples show how this plan might cover
medical care in given situations. Use these
examples to see, in general, how much financial
protection a sample patient might get if they are
covered under different plans.

Questions and answers about the Coverage Examples:
What are some of the
assumptions behind the
Coverage Examples?









Costs don’t include premiums.
Sample care costs are based on national
averages supplied by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services, and aren’t specific to a
particular geographic area or health plan.
The patient’s condition was not an
excluded or preexisting condition.
All services and treatments started and
ended in the same coverage period.
There are no other medical expenses for
any member covered under this plan.
Out-of-pocket expenses are based only
on treating the condition in the example.
The patient received all care from innetwork providers. If the patient had
received care from out-of-network
providers, costs would have been higher.

What does a Coverage Example
show?

Can I use Coverage Examples
to compare plans?

For each treatment situation, the Coverage
Example helps you see how deductibles,
copayments, and coinsurance can add up. It
also helps you see what expenses might be left
up to you to pay because the service or
treatment isn’t covered or payment is limited.

Yes. When you look at the Summary of

Does the Coverage Example
predict my own care needs?

 No. Treatments shown are just examples.
The care you would receive for this
condition could be different based on your
doctor’s advice, your age, how serious your
condition is, and many other factors.

Does the Coverage Example
predict my future expenses?

No. Coverage Examples are not cost
estimators. You can’t use the examples to
estimate costs for an actual condition. They
are for comparative purposes only. Your
own costs will be different depending on
the care you receive, the prices your
providers charge, and the reimbursement
your health plan allows.

Benefits and Coverage for other plans,
you’ll find the same Coverage Examples.
When you compare plans, check the
“Patient Pays” box in each example. The
smaller that number, the more coverage
the plan provides.

Are there other costs I should
consider when comparing
plans?

Yes. An important cost is the premium
you pay. Generally, the lower your
premium, the more you’ll pay in out-ofpocket costs, such as copayments,
deductibles, and coinsurance. You
should also consider contributions to
accounts such as health savings accounts
(HSAs), flexible spending arrangements
(FSAs) or health reimbursement accounts
(HRAs) that help you pay out-of-pocket
expenses.

****** REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BY MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, STATE OF THE
CITY ADDRESS ******

March 10, 2015
Washington High School
Thank you Council President Scott. Thank you Pastor Taylor for our invocation.
Thank you to the color guard of the Junior ROTC, and thank you to that
phenomenal band. And thank you, Principal Sanders and Washington High School
for hosting us all this evening.
Members of the Common Council, distinguished guests, city employees, residents,
students, neighbors, friends:
[2015_State_of_the_City_Report]Not long ago, in a quiet moment in my office, I
found myself looking at the seal of the City of South Bend. And for the first
time in a long time, I took a good long look at the imagery it bears. Much like
a tree in your yard, a painting in a church, or a name on a plaque, a City seal
is the sort of thing you can glance at a thousand times without actually
noticing its features. But our seal is worth a good look, because it says a lot
about the thoughts of those who came before us, the people who formed and led
this city long before our time.
In the middle of the seal is the word “PEACE,” which meant a great deal to
a people who had known years of civil war. In the year this city was
established, the very core of our nation had been shaken by a war no less
terrible and defining than what is going on today in Iraq or Ukraine or
Afghanistan.
Also on the seal is an American flag, which also would not have been taken for
granted in 1865. The very survival of that flag and the republic for which it
stands had been doubted, challenged, tested, and had seemed less likely than
not, more than once, right up until that very year. It must have been an act of
great hope, then, for the people of our city to organize themselves into our
present form in that year, looking to the future so soon after the country had
come through a violent test of whether it would exist any longer at all.
And then there is the last feature on the seal, a sun emerging from behind a
bed of clouds, its rays reaching upward and outward. The sun, of course,
represents a new beginning, and it represents hope. It has special meaning in
this time of year, this warm week that came just in time, after one of those
punishing Februaries that make you begin to question whether it is even
possible that spring and summer actually exist. The dependability of the sun,
the knowledge that it will always rise in the morning and will always warm us
in spring and summer, make it the ultimate symbol of faith in the future.
One hundred and fifty years after our City was incorporated, we are living in
that future. And there can be no doubt that the extent of our City, the scale
of our buildings, the productive power of our workers, and the measure of our
learning would amaze the men who drew up papers of incorporation in May of 1865
to make this place officially a city.
They could not have imagined that the community they established would one day
boast a modern skyline and an airport, five institutions of higher learning,
hospitals capable of carrying out such sophisticated and lifesaving operations,
firms producing everything from jetliner brakes to molecular diagnostic
devices.
And yet for all the extraordinary progress of the last 150 years, we have seen
tremendous challenges too, ups and downs that led many to question the very
endurance of our community. In particular, the economic struggle of our city in
the last fifty years led some to ask if the sun was setting on this great
community. The winter of 1963-1964 raised the question of whether we could
withstand the loss of Studebaker. Population loss in almost every decade since
then threw doubt on our city’s ability ever to grow again. Just four years
ago in early 2011, a Newsweek article suggested we were a dying city, and some
here seemed willing to believe it—even though we were designated one of the
country’s ten All-America Cities that very same year.
It was in the midst of that debate that this administration arrived in office,
and began doing everything we could to ensure this decade would be remembered
as one of growth and progress in our hometown. It can be difficult to believe
that we are already in year four of my term—what I hope will come to be known
as my first term—in office.
Yet a tremendous amount has happened, both last year and in the last three
years and three months. Today, thanks to the hard work of this administration
team as well as the groundwork and progress achieved by my predecessors, the
City is already markedly different. Just as each of my predecessors could point
to major progress made compared to the time he took office, in this fourth year
of my administration I feel confident in saying that our city has moved rapidly
forward. We may have a long way to go, but we are headed in the right
direction.
If our first year, 2012, was a year of groundwork, transition, and preparation,
and our second year of 2013 was a year of action, then 2014 ought to be
remembered as a year of results. In last year’s state of the city address, I
concentrated on the way we do business in this administration—a way of doing
business built on partnerships, on customer service, on innovation, inclusion
and transparency, on teamwork, and recognizing community as capacity. This
year, I would like to focus on what that way of doing business has got us, how
it has improved our city. I will focus on results because however much work we
still have ahead of us, the results are telling us what is right about our
approach.
In every major area of policy-—neighborhoods and quality of life, crime and
safety, jobs and economic development—our city is better off than it was even
just one year ago, thanks to a way of doing business that is working for South
Bend. Faster than at any time since this administration arrived, the results
are coming in and they are looking good.
2014: DEPLOYMENT
Before going into detail about these results, I should pause to acknowledge the
peculiar circumstances of 2014, especially the fact that for seven months, I
had to watch these results materialize from far away. My deployment to
Afghanistan made 2014 a highly unusual year for the administration, the city,
and for me personally. I want to offer a personal note of thanks to the city of
South Bend for your extraordinary support in the form of thoughts, prayers,
care packages and well wishes during my time serving overseas. They made a
great difference to me and also to my family who watched and waited here in
South Bend, like everyone else, until I came home to a warm welcome on a cool
night in September.
Before going, I shared my conviction that people join the military and go to
places like Afghanistan in order to protect places like South Bend, and noted
that I expected to come back to South Bend a better man and mayor than I had
left. Admittedly, I did not know then how exactly that would come about, but
now I can report that this indeed happened.
One thing that happened there was that I learned the importance of a city that
works. Part of my service consisted of frequent assignments as an armed driver
or escort on convoys in and around the Afghan capital city of Kabul, seeing
first-hand the challenges faced by residents of a city that could not provide
the basics that we here take for granted. Everything from safe streets to
reliable trash pickup, fire suppression to clean drinking water, is hard to
come by in many other countries. Our mission here in this administration is to
provide it so seamlessly that people can take it for granted, leaving them free
to pursue whatever they most care about in life. The urgency of that mission
has for me become even more vivid after seeing a place where it could not be
counted on.
Also, I must say that serving partly in a staff role as a junior officer, doing
the sorts of things that mayor’s office staff and administration employees do
here at my instructions, reminded me of the enormous value and benefit of
teamwork. The administration faced its share of challenges during my seven
months’ leave, and rose to the occasion in ways that show what this
team—and our whole community—are made of.
A summer storm lay waste to many of our oldest and largest trees, severely
damaging homes and properties in parts of South Bend. The administration and
community came together to ensure cleanup was swift and efficient, and began
work immediately to repair what was damaged and replace what was destroyed.
A terrible underground fire triggered a downtown power blackout that could have
been devastating to our downtown retail economy, coming as it did on the
busiest restaurant reservation weekend of the year. Instead, our city rallied,
with my office working closely with the power company and the unified downtown
restaurants, working together to provide cold storage and set it up right on
the gridiron of the Hall of Fame so that none of them would lose their product
and sales over the weekend.
None of this or anything else we do would have been possible without an
administration full of employees who stepped up to ensure that our city
government continued to serve residents well, not missing a beat. And our
entire city owes a debt of gratitude to Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, Chief of Staff
Kathryn Roos, and all of the department leaders, mayoral staff, and others
whose day-to-day work was affected by the deployment. Before, during, and since
my time away, our hard-working City team kept quality services available
without missing a beat. And the results are clear.
ECONOMY
Perhaps the most remarkable results of 2014 have to do with the impressive and
accelerating comeback we have seen in South Bend’s economy. Our building
department issued permits for 1,408 building projects with a total valuation of
over $84 million, just last year. Last year, our Department of Community
Investment contributed to the creation of some 1,368 new jobs along with over
$180 million in private investment. Of those jobs, at least 405 have already
come into being, with the remainder expected to come online soon. The majority
of these jobs are on the West Side of our city, where economic need has been
especially pressing.
South Bend’s unemployment rate now stands at 7.4 percent, higher than we want
it but dramatically down from the 11.6 percent we saw when I took office in
2012. The job creation achievements of even just the last year are too numerous
to go over in full, but I’d like to mention a few. Lippert Components worked
with our Department of Community Investment to establish a new home in the
former A.J. Wright building, whose persistent vacancy in a large facility on
the West Side has been a struggle for years. The deal will lead to 380 jobs and
$2.3 million in investment.
Nearby, Nello Corporation decided to consolidate its operations in South Bend
from Texas and Bremen into a new $57 million facility that will lead to the
creation of 540 jobs by 2023. Not far from Nello, the city worked with Noble
Americas to reactivate the ethanol plant, restoring 67 jobs for local residents
and resolving a major problem with the surrounding water table that affected
residents in the area.
And even since last year, good news has continued to come in the form of an
announcement that FedEx has chosen South Bend to locate a facility that will
lead to hundreds of jobs on the Northwest side of the city.
South of downtown, work with Union Station Technology Center continues on the
Ivy Tower project, with remediation scheduled to be completed by the end of
this year. Meanwhile, in Ignition Park, where the data hosting firm Data Realty
led the way and a new multi-tenant building is under construction to house more
local startups like F-cubed, a new collaboration will bring another world-class
facility to the heart of our city. Built in partnership with the University of
Notre Dame and General Electric, a new Turbomachinery project called ND Turbo
represents $33 million in investment and at least 57 jobs, with a strong chance
of drawing more companies to locate close to what will be some of the most
advanced testing facilities in the world.
A little further north, a historic comeback is underway in our central business
district. The office, retail, and restaurant scene downtown has grown
dramatically, with 22 new businesses opening last year alone, representing 260
jobs. The total number of restaurants in the downtown area has more than
doubled since 2012, and more are expected this year. Storefront occupancy has
gone over 80 percent for the first time since we started keeping track in 2011.
Just as important as the numbers is the feel of our city, where more people
sense the vibrancy and energy we have been craving for years. The crowds out at
events like DTSB First Fridays, the full tables at our restaurants, even just
the looks on the faces of people visiting the downtown area, show that our
downtown is in the midst of a tremendous comeback.
Not that long ago, our newspaper opinion pages were full of rhetorical
crossfire over whose fault it was that the Indiana Economic Development
Corporation had not done a deal in our county. Some blamed state officials for
neglecting our area; others blamed South Bend for being too Democratic and
business-unfriendly. Moving past the blame game, we have worked across party
lines with our state partners to help deliver business growth and job creation
at a pace not seen in years. IEDC has been involved in 18 economic development
deals in South Bend since 2012, including nine deals just last year, and we
expect the relationship will yield more good jobs in the future.
It has been particularly encouraging to see the IEDC embrace the concept of
city-led regional economic development, through the Regional Cities program to
support Indiana communities working regionally to develop quality of place.
When state officials convened local leaders in each part of the state to
discuss the concept, the meeting held here in South Bend was the single best-
attended anywhere in Indiana. I hope this program receives full funding from
the state legislature in order to help kick-start our economic recovery. To
survive in the economy ahead, our area will need to continue learning to think
as a region, because our most serious economic competition isn’t coming from
places like Mishawaka, it’s coming from places like China.
All across South Bend, the economy is rebounding. But keeping up the pace of
this job growth will not be easy, and the biggest issue we face is the
readiness of our workforce. That’s why we’ve been partnering with our
schools on efforts like Project Lead The Way, which enriches the science,
technology, engineering and math curriculum in local classrooms. It’s why we
are working with Goodwill to ensure adults are able to complete missing high
school education. And it’s why the city has engaged with employers to
establish the SMART workforce program, which provided scholarships and training
for local workers. 
NEIGHBORHOODS
We have also seen results in the neighborhoods of our city, of which the most
remarkable is the impact we have had on vacant and abandoned homes. This was
the number one neighborhood issue that residents spoke about when I reached out
to them during the campaign, and it has become clear that no single issue has
had more effect on the value and viability of our neighborhoods.
This is why we pulled together a diverse coalition of civic, nonprofit,
business, and elected leaders on a task force that spent more than a year
preparing its detailed report on the vacant and abandoned housing issue in
South Bend. And it’s why I announced, two years ago, a bold initiative to
address one thousand houses in one thousand days.
Today we are 742 days into the initiative, and I am pleased to report that 790
houses have been addressed. This means they have either been repaired,
demolished, or put under contract. I am especially pleased to report that of
those 790 houses, 274 have been repaired rather than demolished. In fact, many
were repaired without the use of any taxpayer funds, after we revamped our
approach to code enforcement so that formerly irresponsible landlords stepped
up to do the right thing. Another 62 houses are being addressed through a
creative partnership with the State of Indiana under the Blight Elimination
Program. The remaining houses will be among the toughest to deal with in the
city, but the coalition we have built to address the problem has what it takes
to get the job done. And this year through the Urban Enterprise Association, we
are offering matching grants of up to $10,000 to owners prepared to improve a
vacant and abandoned house in a South Bend neighborhood.
Increasingly, the work will shift from how to address crumbling houses, to how
to find value in the land after some of them are cleared. A promising example
now underway is the South Bend Mutual Homes project, providing low to moderate
income families with newly constructed homes built on lots left vacant after
demolitions, leading to stronger neighborhoods and more affordable family
housing in our city.
Also improving neighborhoods has been an expansion of our city’s program to
improve curbs and sidewalks. South Bend has 3.9 million linear feet of
sidewalk, and about a quarter of that sidewalk needs work. We can’t do it all
at once. But we’ve expanded funds in this year’s budget and invited each
Council member to allocate a share of the funding to an area of demonstrated
need. Meanwhile, the federal Safe Routes to School program is allowing us to
improve sidewalks near Harrison and Coquillard Schools, with hopes for more
improvements around other neighborhood schools in the future.
Meanwhile, our Public Works Department partnered with Council members Tim Scott
and Karen White on a neighborhood program called Light Up South Bend, working
with the power company to deliver more and better street lights to enhance
safety and livability in our neighborhoods. Already we have installed 67 lights
in the West Side neighborhoods of LaSalle Park and Keller Park, with more new
lights coming to the South and Southeast sides this year. Meanwhile, we are
reactivating the lamp post cost-share program which allows residents to install
a lamp post in the front yard at reduced cost, enhancing the quality of life
and safety along the sidewalks. 
SAFETY
Of course, no neighborhood issue is more pressing than ensuring that the
reality and the perception of safety are where they ought to be in every part
of our city. Here, too, we have a long way to go but we are headed in the right
direction.
According to the most recent data in the Uniform Crime Reports database of the
FBI, both violent crime and property crime are at their lowest rate in over
twenty years, even as improved policing technology means that more of the
crimes that do happen are reported than before, which will put upward pressure
on the numbers.
Perhaps the most dramatic results of the past year in public safety have to do
with the outcomes of the Group Violence Initiative. Motivated by a flare-up of
gun violence in the city, in 2012 we began seeking approaches that would move
past the old, failed solutions to crime that make for good headlines but
don’t get real results, and sometimes make the problem worse.
Instead, we went looking for approaches backed up by evidence of success.
Confronting violent crime is a problem as old as civilization itself, but some
communities have done a better job than others, and we wanted to find out how.
We formed a diverse coalition of community leaders to tackle the problem, and
after more than a year of research and preparation, we adopted the National
Network for Safe Communities’ Group Violence Intervention. This strategy,
which presents a clear choice to young people associated with groups or gangs
that cause violence—we’ll help you if you let us, and stop you if you make
us—was launched in May of 2014. Coordinated by the Community Foundation of
St. Joseph County, with involvement that reaches from local, state, and federal
law enforcement to faith leadership, schools, public health and social
services, this is a true community partnership with results.
Since this group kicked off the strategy last May, compared to comparable
periods in the previous year, the number of persons shots in crimes in our city
is down by 39 percent. It is far too soon to rest easy or to get comfortable
with these results, but if we continue to succeed and cement that result, it
will prove to be one of the most powerfully effective public safety
interventions in the history of our city.
Serious concerns remain, including fluctuations in property crime, and a clear
need for new approaches to confront the problem of domestic violence which has
played out for too long in the shadows. But our Police Department and our
community at large are increasingly equipped to deal with these challenges. We
are using technology in new ways, as in the case of the successful deployment
of ShotSpotter technology to aid and automate dispatch. And we have
reconfigured our police beat organization so that captains become experts in an
area instead of working by time of day, which will make it easier to practice
neighborhood and community-oriented policing.
PRESS
As we make these gains, the rest of the world continues to take note. Our work
has earned South Bend more national and international recognition in the past
year. The world’s top business journal, the Harvard Business Review, recently
featured South Bend’s vacant housing work in an article entitled, “What
Business Can Learn from Government,” which is not a phrase you hear every
day. Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government recently honored South
Bend with its “Bright Ideas” award for the Department of Community
Investment’s work with the Drucker Institute. And the recovery of our real
estate market prompted national coverage of our rebounding home values.
One piece of press we could have done without was an academic paper that
suggested the South Bend-Mishawaka statistical area was unusually
“unhappy.” Left out of most of the coverage is the fact that the study
didn’t look at South Bend today, it looked at data from 2005 to 2009.
It’s not hard to imagine why 2009, when unemployment was at 13 percent, was
an unusually unhappy year for our city. 2009 doesn’t sound very long ago. But
think of how much has happened in South Bend just since then. 2009 is before
Eddy Street Commons was fully up and running. Before the South Bend Cubs,
before a round of major improvements to the ballpark. Before the Five Points
was anything but the Five Points, and before it was certain what, if anything
at all, was going to take the place of St. Joseph Hospital downtown.
Culturally, 2009 was before LangLab and the Pool, before South by South Bend
and the Music Village, before nearly a thousand volunteers painted a decrepit
bridge on the northern approach to our city and made it a work of art. It was
before the Liga del Barrio and the Civil Rights Heritage Center and the Kroc
Center on the West Side, before Downtown had a Linden Grill or a Brew Werks or
a Café Navarre or anything like the East Bank Village or the River Race
Townhomes, before there was a single building in Ignition Park. 2009 was before
you started seeing those little “I heart SB” buttons and stickers and
bracelets all around town. We may have a long way to go, but look how far we
have come, and think of how far we could get in another five or 10 years.
And we’re doing everything we can to keep it that way. Not only are there the
major, high-profile efforts I just discussed, there are countless other
initiatives taking place out of the spotlight and under the hood, low-profile
but incredibly important to keeping this city headed in the right direction.
The day-in, day-out work of employees in every department of this city makes it
possible for the growth and resurgence to continue.
Consider bond re-fundings—certainly not the sexiest topic, but our
Administration and Finance department saved taxpayers more than a quarter of a
million dollars just last year, by looking for smarter ways to finance our city
projects. Our bond rating didn’t get much coverage, but we were reaffirmed as
AA, which means that we have been certified as having some of the strongest
city finances in the state. No class-two city in Indiana has a higher bond
rating. It’s taken tough choices to make that happen, and will take more to
keep it that way, but our financial fundamentals are strong.
Chances are no one will write a hot news story about our legal and collections
process, but residents deserve to know that we have completely updated our
approach, more than doubling the city’s success in collections on property
damage and EMS and already saving South Bend taxpayers hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
Most residents will never see it, but the new Luther Taylor Fire Training
Center has elevated the standards of our whole region for fire department
training, so much so that other fire departments are contracting with us to
train their firefighters, and it will make our city a safer place to live.
Without much public fanfare, to date our legal department has handled 1,913
requests for information under the Access to Public Records Act, all without
one violation. So far in this administration there are 6,348 times that a
citizen has gotten information requested, and zero times we have erred on the
side of not sharing what we legally should. Meanwhile, we continue to go above
and beyond the legal minimum by publishing our data—including information
about every city expenditure—to the city’s online Open Data Portal, the
first of its kind in the state of Indiana.
Meanwhile, our efforts on customer service continue. The city’s 311 line,
which didn’t even exist three years ago, recently took its 300,000th call,
and we are field-testing a 311 smartphone app so you can address everything
from a water bill issue to a pothole right from your phone.
Some of our best results are coming not by the workings of government but the
initiative of the community. One more unsung but deeply encouraging development
is the success of the Mentor South Bend initiative, featuring a partnership
between Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Education Foundation. The effort is
well on its way to doubling the number of mentors helping children in our
community, with Big Brothers Big Sisters growing from 200 mentors to 359 in
South Bend in less than two years, and the Education Foundation program growing
from 121 to 184 in an even shorter period of time.
CHALLENGES
These are just a handful of the good things happening across our administration
and our city. I wish I could tell you about every one of them, but we would be
here all night. But as I keep saying, we know we have a long way to go. Every
city has its challenges, and our city has its share. We are challenged by
everything from the fatigue and expense of two harsh winters in a row, to the
budget challenges associated with rising costs and tightly constricted revenue.
Perhaps the most pressing challenge before us is how to take care of our most
vulnerable. There is no reason to ignore the fact that 27.8 percent of our
residents live below the poverty line, and we must do more to confront the
problem. This means continuing to address transportation issues that affect
people’s ability to get and keep good jobs, and ensuring that agencies like
the South Bend Housing Authority are well-positioned to meet the needs of our
low-income residents. The recent decision by United Way to concentrate its
efforts on addressing the needs of those living with low income is another step
in the right direction that our community should rally around—not just to
help those in poverty, but to help those in poverty get out of poverty.
Like the rest of America, we are still struggling to ensure that the economic
recovery reaches everyone in our city. As I mentioned before, most of our
recent job creation has been on the West Side. But we know that many in our
community, including those who live nearest some of these jobs, have not been
able to find work even with the falling unemployment rate. That’s why we must
continue to ensure our workers are equipped for the jobs that are actually
open, gaining both the hard and soft skills needed to succeed in today’s
workplace. The measures we have put in place are a good step; we will continue
to seek out more.
Another enduring challenge for South Bend will be addressing the federally
mandated Long Term Control Plan to bring our sewers into compliance with the
Clean Water Act. Under the terms negotiated with the Department of Justice and
the Environmental Protection Agency in 2011, South Bend is required to complete
over $600 million in upgrades over the next twenty years. The cost is daunting,
but there may be opportunities to use better technological and environmental
approaches to bring the bill down for the benefit of rate payers in our area.
For this reason, our Department of Public Works has initiated a major
engineering study to evaluate the many changes that have taken place in this
space even in those last few years, with a goal of saving at least $100 million
for the people of South Bend. Again, doing so will not be easy, but I have been
in dialog with a coalition of mayors from across the Midwest facing similar
mandates, exchanging ideas and joining forces to seek new answers for our
cities.
Perhaps the most widely discussed challenges our community is facing today have
to do with ensuring that this truly feels like one city, belonging to all. As a
city we are unquestionably better off because of the diversity of our people,
giving us a rich heritage and much to learn from one another. But we are also
struggling, like all of America, to overcome centuries of division, a legacy of
prejudice and segregation and separation that casts its shadow to this day.
The long shadow of that problem is reflected in the fact that everywhere from
corporate boardrooms to college classrooms to our city workforce itself, not
all parts of our communities are represented.
To be sure, we have made strides that are significant and important. The
mayor’s office staff is a case in point. My staff consists of more African-
American and Latino employees than white employees, has ideological diversity,
members of diverse orientations and a female majority—perhaps the first time
that all that diversity has been present all at once in a South Bend mayor’s
office. We do this not because it helps us check a box, but because it helps us
make better decisions and serve our city more effectively.
We have also moved intentionally to ensure that our many boards and commissions
are made even more diverse than I found them, with more female and more ethnic
minority appointees to key boards across our administration.
Our department of law is led by the first African-American corporation counsel
in our city’s history, and the team she is building is a great example of how
to establish the very highest standards both of professional accomplishment and
of diverse backgrounds on a single local government team.
On the other hand, our workforce as a whole does not yet fully represent the
city it serves. We may be ahead of some communities in the region, but we have
a long way to go. And even when the face of the community is truly reflected in
the work forces, faculties, boardrooms, and committees of our city, there will
be more work to do. Experience has taught us that there is more to inclusion
than just who is in the room. It is a matter of the way we do business, how we
ensure more voices are heard. Getting this right is crucial to how we establish
more widespread trust in the community.
Once again, this is not only a challenge for South Bend but for all of America.
The last year has thrown our whole country into a needed but often painful
dialogue about how we can live together as one, especially when it comes to the
relationship between communities of color and law enforcement. This past
weekend’s 50th anniversary of the Selma march was a powerful reminder of how
far we have come, but also of just how much we have to overcome. There is no
escaping the fact that the most grievous injustices experienced by minorities
in American history were often served at the hands of police officers. And
every police officer today, even the most forward-thinking among them, even
police officers who are themselves African-American, is forced to deal with the
fact that even if they had nothing personally to do with those injustices, the
uniform did. And so for all the good reasons that our men and women have to be
proud of that uniform and the service and sacrifice it represents, it also
remains the case that the uniform has a lot to overcome.
That’s why such bitter disagreements have arisen over something as seemingly
minor and symbolic as T-shirts. And that, let’s face it, is why there will be
divisions in our community related to the controversy over police department
tape recordings, no matter what the courts decide, and no matter what anyone
does or does not get to hear from the conversations of others. This is not
about T-shirts and it is not about tapes. This is about trust. And we won’t
get anywhere as a community until we learn how to build trust, the hard
way—by taking on the roots of this challenge directly, by resisting the urge
to go back to what divides us, by coming together to make this a better place.
Building a more diverse police department is one step, and it’s a step
we’re taking. That’s part of why new recruitment incentives went into our
budget for this year. And it’s why I have publicly committed to engaging
services of professionals with a proven track record of helping American cities
improve diversity and inclusion in their hiring in public safety and beyond.
It’s why we are exploring new ways of elevating the voice of the community in
the practice of law enforcement in South Bend. But the biggest steps will have
to draw on our community as a whole.
It’s time for South Bend to begin talking about racial reconciliation. That
means honest, frank discussions that allow city leaders, law enforcement, and
community members to face the mistakes of the past and establish shared ground
for the future. We cannot reach our full potential for community-oriented
policing until we have made it the norm that all residents feel and know that
we have every reason to be both pro-minority and pro-police, at the same time.
There is no contradiction between respecting the risks that police officers
take every day in order to protect this community, and recognizing the need to
overcome the biases implicit in a justice system that treats people from
different backgrounds differently, even when they are accused of the same
offenses. We need to take both those things seriously, for the simple and
profound reason that all lives matter.
2015: THE YEAR AHEAD
Our challenges our great, but our opportunities are greater. The results we
have seen in the last year and the last few years leave no doubt that that sun
emerging on our city seal is still a rising sun for South Bend. And the year
ahead promises to be another one of good results for our neighborhoods,
residents, families and businesses.
More business growth is coming to our city, from repair and renovation underway
in buildings like the LaSalle Hotel and Hoffman Hotel downtown, to over a
million square feet of new commercial space under construction this year.
We will also be continuing the work of the Smart Streets program, with most of
2015’s work concentrated on Western Avenue and Lincoln Way West Corridors as
well as preparing roundabouts to better distribute traffic downtown. The effort
will continue into 2016, when the bulk of the two-way conversion downtown will
take place. This initiative is the result of more than two dozen public
meetings and three major public debates and votes with strong supporting
majorities on the Common Council. It gives us the chance to make our city
streets safer, more attractive, and more economically productive, all by going
back to principles that served South Bend well in the past and serve other
American cities well today.
Our growth in the use of technology will continue, with our new Office of
Innovation, led by our new Chief Innovation Officer Santiago Garces, hard at
work improving city processes and management while we bring on a Chief
Technology Officer to drive the future IT strategy of the City. In this
century, municipal IT can and must go far beyond the traditional “help
desk” functions of the early 1990s, and we will continue to expand our vision
for how technology can deliver cost savings for taxpayers and better services
for residents.
2015 will also see the beginning of a number of upgrades to Parks and
Recreation facilities, using a $5 million bond recently authorized by the
Council. These funds will allow us to address deferred maintenance while
expanding gymnasium space and recreational resources, and also providing a
large number of small enhancements to parks throughout the City. Based on what
we learn with this effort, we will pursue further investments in the future,
with a goal of making sure we offer access to good parks and programs for every
resident and child in every neighborhood, while establishing some truly
distinctive parks that benefit the whole city. A great parks and recreation
system creates memorable places, supports public health, spurs economic
development, preserves green space, and helps build community and neighborhood
identity. To make our network of parks and recreation programming all that it
can be for the next fifty years, we will need to make additions and
subtractions, always with input from the community.
And as I never tire of reminding people, this year South Bend is celebrating
her 150th anniversary of incorporation. The celebrations are already underway
and will last throughout the year, with educational, promotional, and community
activities taking place in every part of our City. Countless local leaders and
volunteers have been collaborating on planning the events and activities, with
a major celebration planned on the weekend of our official May 22nd birthday.
The heart of our city will come alive with concerts, fireworks, exhibits, and
even zip lines, all to bring South Bend residents of all ages together. During
the festivities, we will dedicate a light sculpture on the river that will
serve for years as a commemoration of this special year.
FUTURE
The 150th anniversary is about more than just how we celebrate this year.
It’s about putting this year, and the times we are living in, into context.
Every day I work in this job increases my conviction that we are living in one
of the most pivotal and transformational moments in our city’s history. This
is not only the city’s 150th year, it is a hinge point in our city’s
trajectory. And we would do well to think of this year as the first year of the
next 50 years. The other day in Selma, President Obama quoted Langston
Hughes’ moving line: “We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know
how.”
My hope and expectation is to be on hand for the city’s bicentennial—50
years from now in 2065—83 years old and a happily retired former mayor. I
often think about how our city will look then. Undoubtedly it will be different
in many respects. If demographic trends hold, it will be even more diverse, and
so will its leadership. The buildings will look different; the streets and ways
of getting around will have shifted with the times. We will, if only from
necessity, have developed more sustainable ways of living, just as our patterns
of life have now become more sustainable than they were even one or two
generations ago. Many here will work in industries that you and I cannot even
conceive.
But some things will be the same. Our winters will be cold and our summers hot.
Our magnificent river will continue to flow through the heart of our city, a
great resource and a natural treasure. Our community will continue to respond
to ups and downs by looking out for each other and pulling together in tough
times. Our people will still be strong in faith, work ethic, community spirit
and generosity. And they will take that spirit into their lives as they pursue
the things that matter to them: family and friends, ideas and enterprise,
scholarship and music and sports.
And the people of this city, 50 or 150 years from now, will continue to find
that their well-being is closely tied to the well-being of their city. Their
freedom to pursue the good life will depend in part on how well their city
takes care of the basics of support so they don’t have to, and how well the
city creates a set of places where their lives can play out better than if they
lived somewhere else. Just like today. And all that will depend on the choices
we make, for ourselves and for the future. If we can continue to make our city
more perfect each passing year, to take risks and even make mistakes but always
to take more steps forward than backward, to do what is right for this city
even when it is not easy, then we will give them every reason to look at that
city seal and continue to agree that what they see is a rising sun.
Our work matters because in a well-run city, people are at greater liberty to
live well. And it matters because the choices we make now telescope through
time into the future. So we build our city for tomorrow, strong as we know how.
And each passing year, our know-how grows greater, so long as we are not afraid
to learn. We learn from our past, we learn from each other, we learn from ideas
that we seek out, close to home and far away. And we learn from our mistakes.
We learn, we grow, we build, we make choice after choice to move ourselves and
our community forward, and when the time for speeches is over, the results will
speak for themselves.

MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS COMMITTEE
The Municipal Corporations Committee of the City-County Council met on Monday, March 19,
2007. Chairman Ron Gibson called the meeting to order at 4:36 p.m. with the following
members present: Vernon Brown, Lonnell Conley, Sherron Franklin, Scott Keller, and Earl
Salisbury. Isaac Randolph was absent. Council President Monroe Gray was also in
attendance.
PROPOSAL NO. 105, 2007 - reappoints Monroe Gray to the Capital Improvement Board of
Managers.
Chairman Gibson stated that Councillor Gray is ending a meeting and would be here as soon as
possible. He said that Councillor Gray has served the Council well on the board and asked for
any comments, none were offered.
Councillor Conley moved, seconded by Councillor Franklin, to send Proposal No. 105, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Chair Gibson stated that he would interrupt the presentation when Councillor Gray arrived.
Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library Update Presentations:
Laura Bramble, Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) Interim Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) distributed a packet (Exhibit A) containing the 2007 IMCPL operating budget,
annual report, and photos of the central library branch. [Clerk’s Note: Exhibit A is on file in the
Clerk’s Office with an original copy of the minutes.]
Chairman Gibson congratulated Ms. Bramble on her position as interim CEO. He said that he is
sure she has been hard at work to meet the needs of the library and its patrons.
Louis Mahern, Library Board President, stated that circulation and door count is up, while
continuing to operate within budget constraints yet still providing superior services.
Chairman Gibson stated that Councillor Gray had arrived. He said that the appointment had
been approved and asked for any comments regarding the Capital Improvement Board.
Councillor Gray thanked the committee for the opportunity to serve and said this is a very
interesting board. He said that he believes that they are doing great things for the city. Some of
the projects, such as the convention center and stadium, have been a challenge, but the
finished product is something to make the city proud.
Councillor Keller stated that the vote to appoint Councillor Gray was unanimous.
Ms. Bramble stated that 2006 was a great year. The library set a circulation record of 13.7
million items checked out. The library also set a visitation record of 5.4 million visits. She
highlighted some of the new services for 2006:
• Live homework help – 4,100 students in grades 4 – 12 have used this online service.
The questions are answered by teachers and there has been lots of good feedback for
this service.

24-hour reference service on the web – This is a service the library purchases and
provides free to patrons.
Downloadable audio books – patrons can download an audio book from the website for
their Mp3 player for 15 days. The book disappears after the time expiration.
Books for Daycare – Central Indiana Community Fund helped the library purchase a
small van to deliver books to licensed daycare facilities.
Bunny Book Bag Program – This is a cloth bag of 20 pre-selected books available for
checkout for mothers, children, and day care providers who do not have enough time to
pick out books.

Ms. Bramble stated that the existing programs have also been extremely successful. The
November 2006 read-a-loud program featured Curious George. This was so popular that many
of the branches were inundated with visitors when Curious George was scheduled to visit. She
added that the 2006 summer reading program had 58,000 participants. She said that the
Central Library construction is going well. Substantial completion should be achieved this
summer. A library mover has been hired to move all the books from the interim location to the
central location this year. An opening date has not yet been set, but they are hoping that it will
be in the fall of 2007.
Ms. Bramble stated that the committee is welcome to take another tour of the building. The
mechanical work, access flooring, tile, carpet, and drywall are complete in most areas of the
building. However, the analysis and design of the garage repairs are still ongoing. Litigation
and mediation regarding the garage work is continuing. The new library will include several
new areas, such as: an Indianapolis special collections room, a language lab, a children and
family area, an adaptive technologies lab, event space, an auditorium, three public meeting
rooms, and a café.
Chairman Gibson said that the committee would like to visit again and asked for a good time to
schedule the visit. Mr. Mahern said that construction is scheduled to be finished in June and the
books will be moved after that. Visiting before the books are moved in would allow the
committee to see all of the finished construction without obstruction. Chairman Gibson agreed
and said that they would plan to visit around that time. Mr. Mahern said that that the old central
library had about 2,000 visitors per day. It is anticipated that the new location will draw about
5,000 visitors per day at the start, and then drop down to an average of 4,000 visitors per day.
He added that this will be the first time that the entire library collection will be on display and
available for visitors.
Chairman Gibson asked for clarification regarding construction finances. Mr. Mahern stated that
there are two funds. Fund 40 is the fund that the money went into for construction. Fund 41 is
the account where the money from the garage problems were deposited. This allowed the
library to keep a completely separate accounting of the garage problems and the costs
associated with it for the public and the courts to see. Fund 40 has $1.9 million left for a
contingency fund, and the construction has gone very well, excluding any costs associated with
the garage.
Chairman Gibson asked if the majority of the construction is complete. Mr. Mahern said that
most of the major construction, except for the auditorium, is complete. The work being done is
mostly finishing work. The building has a concrete floor with another floor 24 inches above it.
This is the access floor; the HVAC ductwork, electrical, and computer cabling is located under

Municipal Corporations Committee
March 19, 2007
Page 3
the floor for repairs. He added that the critical repairs in the garage are complete; the current
garage work is not building critical.
Mr. Mahern stated that the current balance in Fund 41 is $52 million. $45 million has been
issued in bonds. The remaining $7 million results from not building branches at Lawrence or
Flanner House and foregoing some exotic technology.
Chairman Gibson asked for clarification regarding the library’s finances for operations. Becky
Dixon, IMCPL Chief Financial Officer, stated that utilities were budgeted for six months, and
staffing was budgeted for three months for 2007. For 2008, IMCPL will be asking for a budget
for a full year of staffing and operations. She said that they tried to staff most of the positions in
the central library internally, but some specialty positions, such as special needs and technical
positions, need to be hired from outside. Based on the reductions that have been made for the
past two years, they believe there is sufficient funding for the opening and operation of the
central branch.
Ms. Dixon said that they are hoping to move forward with the capital projects fund. This fund is
used to maintain lighting, HVAC, roofing, and paving at the other branches. Their goal is to
keep the fund at the 2006 levels. She said they will be selling the last of the bonds in April 2007
and will be doing a refinancing of old debt. The lower interest rates will allow them to save $1.4
million for the life of the debt.
Chairman Gibson asked for clarification that the 2008 request will remain flat from 2007. Mr.
Mahern stated that this assumes that the library will be able to keep the savings from the debt
refinancing. Chairman Gibson asked by whom that decision is made. Mr. Mahern stated that
the library will propose it, but the Council must approve it.
Councillor Franklin asked in the event that the library is able to keep the refund, if a tax increase
will not then be requested. Mr. Mahern confirmed that this is correct. Ms. Dixon stated that they
will not request any additional money in 2008.
Councillor Keller stated that the annual report states that the library received $84,000 from the
Gates Foundation for 56 additional computers. He said that 41% of households in Marion
County do not have computers at home, and he believes that number is even higher for his
district, so he thinks this is a great thing. He asked what the library is planning for the
Ambassador building. Mr. Mahern stated that they put out a request for proposals. Those that
were returned did not seem to address the issue in a comprehensive way, so they were
rejected. The library owns property east of the library, which is where the staff currently parks.
He said they plan to ask for proposals that deal with the Ambassador and the parking issue.
The proposals will be comprehensive plans for the building, parking, and neighborhood
revitalization.
Councillor Brown asked if both the new central library and the interim central library will be
closed during the transition. Ms. Bramble stated that both will be closed for two to three
months. Councillor Brown asked if the branch will be closed at the end of summer and if
patrons will be notified. Ms. Bramble answered in the affirmative and stated that this will be the
same procedure used when the central branch was moved to the interim location.
[Clerk’s Note: Councillor Franklin left at 5:09 p.m.]

Municipal Corporations Committee

Councillor Brown asked if the library is currently searching for a permanent CEO. Mr. Mahern
stated that the board has decided to keep an interim director until the new building is finished.
The board believes that the building is too much to add to a new CEO, who will have enough on
their plate trying to become acclimated. Councillor Brown stated that he believes that
employee-management relations have been poor in the past. He asked if having an interim
CEO, rather than a permanent CEO, lowers staff morale. Mr. Mahern stated that employee
relations have suffered over the last two or three years, but he believes that those relations
have improved significantly. He does not believe that the lack of a permanent CEO will have an
adverse affect on employees. Councillor Brown stated that the employees are important
because they are the public face of the library. He asked for an update on the process of union
recognition. Mr. Mahern stated that the board passed a resolution last week authorizing Ms.
Bramble and the attorney to conduct an election through the Indiana Department of Labor. Ms.
Bramble has been charged by the board to work out the details of the election process with the
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).
Councillor Conley asked if Ms. Bramble was being considered for the CEO position, especially
since employee morale has improved under her tenure. Mr. Mahern said that he has not
discussed it with her or anyone and does not know if she is interested in the position. Councillor
Conley asked if the $1.4 million in savings can be placed into interest bearing accounts. Mr.
Mahern stated that Ms. Dixon is an asset to IMCPL. Since she has become CFO, banks have
started competitively bidding for library business, and every dime of library money is invested
somewhere. Ms. Dixon stated that there is no idle cash, all of the funds are earning some kind
of interest. She said that the $1.4 million is an amount that will be saved over time because of
refinancing to a lower interest rate. The goal is to make more efficient decisions in the
accounting department. The library is now asking for tax advances from the county, rather than
using tax warrants. Investment earnings have risen from $155,000 in 2005 to $300,000 in 2006
in the operating funds alone. The construction fund has doubled in the last year and a half.
She said they are trying to make wise investments and be accountable as stewards of tax
dollars.
Chairman Gibson said that this is the most positive fiscal outlook from the library in a long time.
The committee is concerned about all of the government entities, but the library branches are
very important to communities. He said that he hopes the good work continues. Mr. Mahern
stated that it is true that employee relations with the library management have not always been
the best, but some of that is attributable to difficult decisions the board has had to make for the
past few years. Those decisions are a large part of why the library is able to report a positive
financial situation today. He said that he wants to make sure that credit is given to Linda Mielke
for making those tough, unpopular decisions during her tenure as CEO. He said that Ms. Mielke
may not have had the best bedside manner during some of these problems, but she is one of
the reasons that the library has been able to improve financially.
Chairman Gibson asked for an update on Glendale library. Mr. Mahern stated that as a result of
negotiations with Kite construction, the library will save $216,000 over three years because of
two key items. The library was due to have a rent increase in 2006, and Kite agreed to not
increase the rent. As part of the mall, the library is charged a common charge for heating and
cooling. Glendale did not bill the library for five years, and then sent a $140,000 bill for the
entire time period. The library asked Kite to forego the bill, and they agreed . He said that once
the construction at Glendale is complete, the board felt that the library space will be less

Municipal Corporations Committee
March 19, 2007
Page 5
favorable than before. When closing the branch became something the board was considering,
Kite became more amenable to negotiation. The lease for Glendale comes up for renewal in
2010, and the board will consider its options at that time. He stated that sooner or later, the
library will have to deal with the mis-distribution of resources in the county. In Perry Township,
there is 15,000 square feet of library space. In Warren Township, there is about 27,000, Pike
Township has 15,000, and Washington Township has 62,500 square feet of library space. He
believes that the library has a responsibility to make sure that everyone in Marion County has a
more even shot at receiving library services. Chairman Gibson stated that he agrees and is
glad that the board is looking at long-term solutions for that problem. He said that he is also
pleased that the library and Kite reached an amicable resolution.
Councillor Brown said that he is pleased that the board is making sure that everyone has
adequate library services. He asked if the library can conduct a survey to find out how people
arrive at the library. In Warren Township, there are many apartment buildings and people who
walk to the library. Other townships may have more people who drive to the library and have an
easier time getting to a library that is farther away. This may help determine where to put
resources. Mr. Mahern stated that Ms. Bramble and the board have discussed forming a longterm plan for the library, including facilities. He said that in the next year, that type of planning
will begin. He added that the last plan was a ten-year plan, and the library is currently at the
end of that cycle.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Municipal Corporations
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:23 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Ron Gibson, Chair
Municipal Corporations Committee

**** Checklist for Violence Prevention
 ****
*** Do my family and I... ***
    * Understand the dangers of weapons, especially firearms, and how to
      prevent accidents?
    * Talk about the costs ? personal and financial ? of violence?
    * Think carefully about the kinds of entertainment we watch and hear?
    * Know and practice ways to settle disputes without violence?
    * Understand and practice basic self-protection strategies?
*** Do my neighbors and I... ***
    * Know each other reasonably well?
    * Work together to make our neighborhoods safe for children?
    * Agree on how and when to step in to prevent childrens' quarrels from
      becoming violent?
    * Discuss how we feel about weapons, including firearms, and what rules and
      standards we agree on?
    * Help each other by joining and taking an active role in Block Clubs and
      Neighborhood Watch?
    * Know that there are positive ways for our children to spend their time
      and energy after school?
    * Identify, discuss, and solve (or get help to solve) troubling conditions
      in our area?
    * Work with police, school officials, civic groups, and others to address
      larger issues for the community?
*** Does my community... ***
    * Have and enforce sound laws and regulations for secure weapons storage
      and against weapons violence?
    * Provide safe ways for residents to dispose of unwanted weapons?
    * Actively provide resources and know-how to help residents learn how to

    * Provide mentoring and other outreach services to troubled youth and
      families?
    * Enlist young people in addressing violence problems?

      strategies and plans?
    * Offer an attractive array of both family-oriented and youth-focused
      events?
    * Have clear standards that reject violence as a presence in the community?
**** Crime Prevention for People with Disabilities
 ****
A physical disability ? impaired vision, hearing, or mobility ? doesn't prevent
you from being a victim of crime. Common sense actions can reduce your risk.

    * Stay alert and tuned in to your surroundings, whether on the street, in
      an office building or shopping mall, driving, or waiting for the bus or
      subway.
    * Send a message that you're calm, confident, and know where you're going.
    * Be realistic about your limitations. Avoid places or situations that put
      you at risk.
    * Know the neighborhood where you live and work. Check out the locations of
      police and fire stations, public telephones, hospitals, restaurants, or
      stores that are open and accessible.
    * Avoid establishing predictable activity patterns. Most of us have daily
      routines, but never varying them may increase your vulnerability to
      crime.
*** At Home
 ***
    * Put good locks on all your doors. Police recommend double-cylinder,
      deadbolt locks, but make sure you can easily use the locks you install.
    * Install peepholes on front and back doors at your eye level. This is
      especially important if you use a wheelchair.
    * Get to know your neighbors. Watchful neighbors who look out for you as
      well as themselves are a frontline defense against crime.
    * If you have difficulty speaking, have a friend record a message ? giving
      your name, address, and type of disability to use in emergencies. Keep
      the tape in a recorder next to your phone.
    * Ask your police department to conduct a free home security survey to help
      identify your individual needs.
*** Out and About
 ***
    * If possible, go with a friend.
    * Stick to well-lighted, well-traveled streets. Avoid shortcuts through
      vacant lots, wooded areas, parking lots, or alleys.
    * Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return.
    * Carry a purse close to your body, not dangling by the straps. Put a
      wallet in an inside coat or front pants pocket. If you use a wheelchair,
      keep your purse or wallet tucked snugly between you and the inside of the
      chair.
    * If you use a knapsack, make sure it is securely shut.
    * Always carry your medical information in case of an emergency.
    * Consider keeping a cellular phone or installing a CB radio in your
      vehicle. On Public Transportation
    * Use well-lighted, busy stops. Stay near other passengers.
    * Stay alert. Don't doze or daydream.
    * If someone harasses you, make a loud noise or say "Leave me alone." If
      that doesn't work, hit the emergency signal on the bus or train.
*** Take a Stand! ***
    * Join, or help organize, a Neighborhood Watch group. Make sure their
      meetings are accessible to people with disabilities. For example, do they
      need a sign language interpreter? Can individuals who use walkers,
      crutches, or wheelchairs enter the meeting place?
    * Work with local law enforcement to improve responses to all victims or
      witnesses of crime. Role-play how people with disabilities can handle
      threatening situations.
    * Work with a rehabilitation center or advocacy groups to offer a
      presentation to schools and other community organizations on the needs
      and concerns of individuals with disabilities.
**** Don't Leave Your Street Sense at Home When You Travel
 ****
    * Use traveler's checks and credit cards instead of cash whenever possible.
      Take only those credit cards you need.
    * Carry a purse close to your body, not dangling by the straps. Carry a
      wallet in an inside coat or from trouser pocket. Better still, wear a
      money pouch underneath your clothing.
    * Be alert for pickpockets in crowded areas like airline, bus and train
      terminals, major tourist attractions and public transportation.
    * Don't look distracted or lost. Walk confidently and stay alert to what's
      happening around you.
    * Stay alert for staged mishaps, like someone bumping into you or spilling
      a drink, a stranger offering to snap a family photo or a pedestrian
      jumping in front of the car and falling so you leap out to investigate.
*** Before You Go
 ***
    * Plan ahead. If you're traveling by car, get maps and plan your route.
      Have the car and tires checked out before you leave.
    * Leave copies of the numbers of your passport, driver's license, credit
      cards and traveler's checks with a friend in case you need to replace
      them.
    * Put lights and a radio on timers to create the illusion that someone is
      at home when you go away. Leave shades, blinds and curtains in normal
      positions. Stop the mail and newspapers or ask a neighbor to take them
      in.
*** Once You're There
 ***
    * When you check into a hotel or motel, check out the locks. Look for
      deadbolts or solid doors with peepholes. FYI... the new coded electronic
      cards are safer than ordinary key locks.
    * Be sure your luggage is locked. Keep it close to you at ? all times.
    * Keep valuable in a hotel safe or safe deposit box. Better still, leave
      them at home.
    * Ask the hotel staff or police about the neighborhood's safety and what
      areas to avoid.
    * Lock belongings in your suitcase or keep them out of sight.
    * Don't display guest room keys in public or carelessly leave them on
      restaurant tables, at the swimming pool, or other places where they can
      be easily stolen.
    * Immediately report any crime to the police.
**** Don't Let Your Guard Down Just Because You Live in the Country
 ****
Rural communities have their own unique crime problems - like theft of crops,
timber, livestock, and expensive farm equipment. Vandals do more than break
mailboxes, they can destroy crops and fields. Alcohol and drug abuse problems
plague rural youth as well as those in the suburbs and cities. And of course,
crimes like burglary, rape, assault, and auto theft happen in rural areas, but
less frequently than in cities.

Invest some time and money in prevention now. What's the payoff? Better
security around your property, less worry about crime and your family's safety.

Be a good neighbor - when you're out and about, keep an eye on neighbors'
homes, livestock, and equipment. Tell them and the sheriff or police about
anything that makes you uneasy or suspicious.
*** Check the Doors and Locks
 ***
    * Make sure outside doors - in your home and outbuildings - are solid wood
      or metal and have dead bolt locks.
    * Use the locks!
    * Secure sliding glass doors with commercially available locks or with a
      broomstick or wooden dowel in the track to jam the door in case someone
      tries to pry it open. Insert screws in the upper track going into the
      fixed frame, to prevent anyone from lifting the door from its track.
    * Secure double-hung windows by sliding bolt or nail through a hole drilled
      at a downward angle in each top corner of the inside sash and part way
      through the outside sash. Secure basement windows well.
*** Check the Outside
 ***
    * Keep your house, driveway, barns, and other buildings well-lighted at
      night. Use timers that automatically turn on outside lights when it gets
      dark.
    * Consider motion sensors that set off lights or alarms.
    * Prune back shrubbery that hides doors, windows, lights, and would-be
      burglars.
    * Keep your fences in good repair. Secure all access roads with gates or
      cables stretched between posts cemented in the ground. Make them visible
      with flags or streamers.
    * Warn thieves that you're on the alert with "No Trespassing," "No
      Hunting," and other signs around your property.
*** Mark Equipment and Livestock
 ***
    * Operation Identification - marking tools, guns, and equipment with a
      permanent identification number such as driver's license or Social
      Security - has helped reduce theft in many rural areas. Work with law
      enforcement to determine the best methods, and make it a community
      project.
    * To help stop modern rustlers, tattoo all livestock (usually on the ears).
      Although it's easier to use eartags or neck chains, these can be removed.
      Mark young stock soon after birth.
    * Take regular counts of all livestock.
*** Protect Your Equipment
 ***
    * Secure gas pumps, gas tanks, storage bins, and grain elevators with
      sturdy padlocks or dead bolts. Keep small equipment - like mowers, bikes,
      snowmobiles - locked in a barn or garage. Keep guns locked and unloaded
      in a secure place away from curious children and would-be thieves.
    * Never leave keys in vehicles or farm equipment.
    * Always lock your trucks and other vehicles when they're not in use. And
      don't leave tools in the open back of a pick-up truck or in an unsecured
      truck bed toolbox.
    * Don't leave major equipment in a field overnight. Lock it in a barn or
      shed near the house, or park where it can be seen from your house or a
      neighbor's.
    * If machines must be left out for long periods of time, disable them by
      removing the rotor, distributor, or battery.
*** Guard Your Crops
 ***
    * Store harvested crops in protected and locked locations.
    * Consider marking grain, hay, or similar crops with nontoxic confetti that
      is easily removed by storage or processing facilities.
    * Keep a record of your valuable timber. Mark each with a paint stripe.
    * Keep storage areas neat and well-organized so that any theft will be
      noticed immediately. This also warns potential thieves that the owner is
      watchful.
    * Check employees' references. Before they start, talk about your crime
      prevention measures.
*** Help Your Neighbors
 ***
    * Get together with others in the community to start a Neighborhood or Farm
      Watch group. Involve all ages, and work with law enforcement. Recruit
      from churches and civic groups. Use CB radios or cellular phones to
      patrol and report suspicious activities to the sheriff or police.
    * When you go away, stop delivery of your mail or newspapers or ask a
      neighbor to pick them up. You want to create the illusion that someone's
      at home and following everyday routines. Have neighbors check your
      property, and return the favor when they leave on business or vacation
      trips.
*** Take a Stand
 ***
    * Ask equipment dealers and farm suppliers to display crime prevention
      information.
    * If your school district doesn't have an alcohol, drug, and crime
      prevention curriculum in place, help start one.
    * Check out recreational opportunities for teens - work with schools, 4-H,
      or Future Farmers to fill the gaps, both after school and on weekends.
    * Educate young people about the hazards of operating farm machinery and
      being around livestock. For example, tractors are involved in 69 percent
      of farm machinery deaths, and young people raised on farms often operate
      these machines at early ages.
**** Don't Make It Easy For a Thief To Steal Your Wheels
 ****
One vehicle is stolen every 20 seconds in the United States. Stolen cars, vans,
trucks, and motorcycles cost victims time and money - and increase everyone's
insurance premiums. They're also often used to commit other crimes.
*** The Basic Prevention Policy
 ***
    * Never leave your car running or the keys in the ignition when you're away
      from it, even for "just a minute".
    * Always roll up the windows and lock the car, even if it's in front of
      your home.
    * Never leave valuables in plain view, even if your car is locked. Put them
      in the trunk or at least out of sight. Buy radios, tape and CD players
      that can be removed and locked in the trunk.
    * Park in busy, well-lighted areas.
    * Carry the registration and insurance card with you. Don't leave personal
      identification documents or credit cards in your vehicle.
    * When you pay to park in a lot or garage, leave just the ignition key with
      the attendant. Make sure no personal information is attached. Do the same
      when you take your car for repairs.
*** Add Extra Protection
 ***
    * Each the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the windows, doors,
      fenders, and trunk lid. This helps discourage professional thieves who
      have to either remove or replace etched parts before selling the car.
      Copy the VIN and your tag number on a card and keep it in a safe place.
      If your vehicle is stolen, the police need this information.
    * Install a mechanical locking device - commonly called clubs, collars, or
      j-bars - that locks to the steering wheel, column, or brake to prevent
      the wheel from being turned more than a few degrees.
    * Investigate security systems if you live in a high-theft area or drive an
      automobile that's an attractive target for thieves. You may get a
      discount on your auto insurance.
    * Look into CAT (Combat Auto Theft) and HEAT (Help Eliminate Auto Theft)
      partnership programs where individuals voluntarily register their cars
      with the police, and allow the police to stop by during certain hours
      when they normally would not be driving (such as midnight to 5a.m.). All
      participants display decals in a designated area on their vehicles.
*** What About Carjacking? ***
Carjacking - stealing a car by force - has captured headlines in the last few
years. Statistically, your chances of being a carjacking victim are very slim
and preventative actions can reduce the risk even more.
    * Approach your car with the key in hand. Look around and inside before
      getting in.
    * When driving, keep your car doors locked and windows rolled up at all
      times.
    * Be especially alert at intersections, gas stations, ATMs, shopping malls,
      convenience and grocery stores - all are windows of opportunity for
      carjackers.
    * Park in well-lighted areas with good visibility, close to walkways,
      stores, and people.
    * If the carjacker has a weapon, give up the car with no questions asked.
      Your life is worth more than a car.
*** Beware of The "Bump and Rob" ***
It works like this. A car, usually with a driver and at least one passenger,
rear-ends or "bumps" you in traffic. You get out to check the damage. The
driver or one of the passengers jumps in your car and drives off.

If you're bumped by another car, look around before you get out. Make sure
there are other cars around, check out the car that's rear-ended you and who's
in it. If the situation makes you uneasy, stay in the car and insist on moving
to a police station or busy, well-lighted area to exchange information.
*** Be on the Lookout
 ***
    * If your car's stolen, report it to the police immediately. Also, report
      abandoned cars to the local agency that handles their removal.
    * When buying a used car from an individual or a dealer, make sure you have
      the proper titles, that the VIN number is intact, and the "federal
      sticker" is on the inside of the driver's door. That sticker should match
      the VIN.
    * Suggest that any dealer, rental car agency, or auto repair shop you use
      offer auto theft prevention information in the waiting rooms.
    * If joy riding is a problem in your community, work to improve
      recreational programs and job opportunities for young people.
**** Family Vacation Fun and Safety
 ****
Planning a family vacation? Whether your destination is Disney World, Denver,
or Denmark, there are certain things you need to keep in mind. Making the trip
fun and enjoyable for everyone is key; that's what it's all about. But just as
important to the success of your trip will be steps you take to make it a safe
one.
*** Before You Leave
 ***
Preventing crime during family travel starts with making sure your home is
protected while you're away. The key is to make it look like you never left:
    * Keep shades and blinds in their normal position.
    * Don't stop mail and newspapers, ask a neighbor to pick them up every day.
    * Put timers on several household lights so they turn on and off at
      appropriate times.
    * Arrange to have grass mowed while you're gone.
    * Make sure all your door and window locks are in working order - and use
      them. Activate your home alarm (if you have one).
    * You might even leave a radio on - or put it on a timer. Ask a neighbor to
      park in your driveway overnight - anything that might suggest someone's
      home. And don't forget to lock all doors and windows when you leave.
*** Packing for Prevention
 ***
Preparing for a family trip requires a lot of planning. You need to decide
where you're going, where you'll stay and how you'll get from one place to
another. You also need to decide what to take with you. Planning can decrease
the chances of crime joining you on your journey. Some tips on what to take:
    * Clean out your wallet or purse before you go; take only essential credit
      cards. Plan to use credit cards or traveler's checks instead of cash
      wherever possible.
    * Carry your purse close to your body, or your wallet in an inside front
      pocket. Better yet, take "fanny packs" or wear a money pouch under your
      clothes.
    * Pack as lightly as possible. Lots of heavy, cumbersome bags will slow you
      down and make you more vulnerable to getting robbed.
    * Expensive designer luggage can draw unneeded attention to your
      belongings. Pack your things in inconspicuous bags.
    * Keep a separate record of the contents of checked luggage. And keep
      anything of value such as medicine and jewelry in a carry-on that stays
      with you.
    * If you are going on an extended vacation, consider shipping large bags to
      your destination in advance. For the return trip, mail bulky new
      purchases home, or ask merchants to do it for you.
*** Out and About
 ***
Your home is secured and you're packed. Now it's time to go. While you and your
family are traveling, it's important to remember that tourists make tempting
targets for thieves. Often lost or distracted, weighed down with bags, and
carrying cameras, tickets and money, unsuspecting travelers attract crime like
a magnet.

The best advise for you and your family is to do all you can to blend in with
the crowd.
    * Don't display expensive jewelry, cameras, bags, and other items that
      might draw attention.
    * Check maps before you go out so you can tour confidently.
    * Stick to well-lighted, well-traveled streets at all times - no shortcuts.
    * Always lock your car when it's parked, even if the stop is brief. Keep
      valuables out of sight, preferably locked in the trunk. Don't advertise
      that you're a tourist by leaving maps and guidebooks on the seat or
      dashboard - keep them in the glove compartment.
    * Traveling safely with your family also means sticking together and
      keeping an eye on your children at all times. Make sure they know where
      you are staying (name and address), and teach them what to do if they get
      lost or separated. You might want to agree on a meeting place, just in
      case. And by all means, make sure your kids know not to accept rides or
      favors from strangers.
Make your family vacation a memorable one for all the right reasons.
**** Home Security: Invest In It Now ****
If you were locked out of your house, would you still be able to get in? Maybe
you keep an unlocked window in the back, or a hidden key in your mailbox or on
top of a window ledge?

You may think this is a good idea, but guess what? If you can break in, so can
a burglar!

One out of ten homes will be burglarized this year. For a small amount of time
and money you can make your home more secure and reduce your chances of being a
victim.

Many burglars will spend no longer than 60 seconds trying to break into a home.
Good locks - and good neighbors who watch out for each other - can be big
deterrents to burglars.
*** Check The Locks
 ***
Did you know that in almost half of all completed residential burglaries,
thieves simply breezed in through unlocked doors or crawled through unlocked
windows?
    * Make sure every external door has a sturdy, well-installed dead bolt
      lock. Key-in-the-knob locks alone are not enough.
    * Sliding glass doors can offer easy access if they are not properly
      secured. You can secure them by installing commercially available locks
      or putting a broomstick or dowel in the inside track to jam the door. To
      prevent the door being lifted off the track, drill a hole through the
      slide door frame and the fixed frame. Then insert a pin in the hole.
    * Lock double-hung windows with key locks or "pin" your windows by drilling
      a small hole into a 45 degree angle between the inner and outer frames,
      then insert a nail that can be removed. Secure basement windows with
      grilles or grates.
    * Instead of hiding keys around the outside of your home, give an extra key
      to a neighbor you trust.
    * When you move into a new house or apartment, re-key the locks.
*** Check The Doors
 ***
A lock on a flimsy door is about as effective as locking your car door but
leaving the window down.
    * All outside doors should be metal or solid wood.
    * If your doors don't fit tightly in their frames, install weather
      stripping around them.
    * Install a peephole or wide angle viewer in all entry doors so you can see
      who is outside without opening the door. Door chains break easily and
      don't keep out intruders.
*** Check The Outside
 ***
Look at your house from the outside. Make sure you know the following tips:
    * Thieves hate bright lights. Install outside lights and keep them on at
      night.
    * Keep your yard clean. Prune back shrubbery so it doesn't hide doors or
      windows. Cut back tree limbs that a thief could use to climb to an upper-
      level window.
    * If you travel, create the illusion that you're at home by getting some
      timers that will turn lights on and off in different areas of your house
      throughout the evening. Lights burning 24 hours a day signal an empty
      house.
    * Leave shades, blinds, and curtains in normal positions. And don't let
      your mail pile up! Call the post office to stop delivery or have a
      neighbor pick it up.
    * Make a list of your valuables - VCRs, stereos, computers, jewelry. Take
      photos of the items, list their serial numbers and description. Check
      with law enforcement about engraving your valuables through Operation
      Identification.
    * Ask local law enforcement for a free home security survey.
*** Consider an Alarm
 ***
Alarms can be a good investment, especially if you have many valuables in your
home, or live in an isolated area or one with a history of break-ins.
    * Check with several companies before you buy so you can decide what level
      of security fits your needs. Do business with an established company and
      check references before signing a contract.
    * Learn how to use your system properly! Don't "cry wolf" by setting off
      false alarms. People will stop paying attention and you'll probably be
      fined.
    * Some less expensive options... a sound-detecting socket that plugs into a
      light fixture and makes the light flash when it detects certain noises,
      motion sensing outdoor lights that turn on when someone approaches, or
      lights with photo cells that turn on when it's dark and off when it's
      light.
*** Burglars Do More Than Steal
 ***
Burglars can commit rape, robbery, and assault if they are surprised by someone
coming home or pick a home that is occupied.
    * If something looks questionable - a slit screen, a broken window or an
      open door - don't go in. Call the police from a neighbor's house or a
      public phone.
    * At night, if you think you hear someone breaking in, leave safely if you
      can, then call the police. If you can't leave, lock yourself in a room
      with a phone and call the police.
    * If an intruder is in your room, pretend you are asleep.
    * Gun are responsible for many accidental deaths in the home every year. If
      you choose to own a gun, learn how to store it and use it safely.
There's More You Can Do

Join a Neighborhood Watch group. If one doesn't exist, you can start one with
help from local law enforcement.
Never leave a message on your answering machine that indicates you may be away
from home now, say "I'm not available right now."
Work with neighbors and local government to organize community clean-ups. The
cleaner your neighborhood, the less attractive it is to crime.
**** Lock Crime Out of Your Home
 ****
Making your home safer from crime doesn't always mean having to install
expensive alarms ? effective home security starts with properly locked doors
and windows and visible, well- lighted entryways.
*** Exterior Doors
 ***
All exterior doors should be either metal or solid wood. For added security,
use strong door hinges on the inside of the door, with non-removable or hidden
pins. Every entry door should be well lighted and have a wide-angle door viewer
so you can see who is outside without opening the door.
*** Locks ***
Strong, reliable locks are essential to effective home security. Always keep
doors and windows locked ? even a five-minute trip to the store is long enough
for a burglar to enter your home.

Use quality keyed knobs as well as deadbolts ? deadbolts can withstand the
twisting, turning, prying, and pounding that regular keyed knobs can't.

When choosing a deadbolt, look for such features as a bolt that extends at
least one inch when in the locked position, to resist ramming and kicking;
hardened steel inserts to prevent the bolt from being sawed off, and a
reinforced strike plate with extra long mounting screws to anchor the lock
effectively.

Most deadbolts are single-cylinder; they operate from the outside with a key
and from the inside with a thumb latches. Double-cylinder deadbolts require a
key to open the lock from both outside and inside your home. These locks are
especially effective for doors with glass within 40 inches of the lock ? an
intruder cannot break the glass and unlock the door by reaching through.

Some jurisdictions do not allow these locks, check with your local law
enforcement or building code authorities before installing a double cylinder
deadbolt. As one alternative, security glazing can be applied to glass panels
in or near the door, or shatterproof glass can be installed, though these
options can be expensive.
*** Sliding Glass Doors
 ***
Sliding glass doors can offer easy entry into your home.To improve security on
existing sliding glass doors, you can install keyed locking devices that secure
the door to the frame; adjust the track clearances on the doors so they can't
be pushed out of their tracks; or put a piece of wood or a metal bar in the
track of the closed door to prevent the door from opening even if the lock is
jimmied or removed.
*** Windows ***
Most standard double-hung windows have thumb turn locks between the two window
panels. Don't rely on these ? they can be pried open or easily reached through
a broken pane. Instead, install keyed locking devices to prevent the window
from being raised from the outside, but make sure everyone in the house knows
where to find the keys in case of an emergency. Some jurisdictions have
restrictions on this type of lock ? check with your local law enforcement
before you install them.

An easy, inexpensive way to secure your windows is to use the "pin" trick.
Drill an angled hole through the top frame of the lower window partially into
the frame of the upper window.Then insert a nail or eyebolt.The window can't be
opened until you remove the nail. Make a second set of holes with the windows
partly opened so you can have ventilation without intruders.
*** Lighting ***
Lighting is one of the most cost-effective deterrents to burglary. Indoor
lighting gives the impression that a home is occupied. If you are going to be
away from your home, consider using automatic timers to switch interior lights
on and off at preset times.

Outdoor lighting can eliminate hiding places. Install exterior lighting near
porches, rear and side doorways, garage doors, and all other points of entry.
Entryways to your home always should be well lighted. Place lights out of reach
from the ground so the bulbs cannot be removed or broken.Aim some lights away
from the house so you can see if anyone is approaching, or install motion-
sensing lights, which turn on automatically as someone approaches.
*** Shrubs and Landscaping
 ***
Your home's walkways and landscaping should direct visitors to the main
entrance and away from private areas.The landscaping should provide maximum
visibility to and from your house.Trim shrubbery that could conceal criminal
activity near doors and windows. Provide light on areas of dense shrubs and
trees that could serve as hiding places. Cut back tree limbs that could help
thieves climb into windows, and keep yard fencing low enough too avoid giving
criminals places to hide.
**** Safety Checklist for Apartments
 ****
*** Check Out Your Apartment ***
Does Your...
    * Entry door have a deadbolt lock and peephole?
    * Sliding glass door have a wooden rod in the track so it can't be opened
      and pins in the overhead frame so it can't be lifted out?
    * Landlord or building manager tightly control all keys?
    * For extra security, leave a radio playing or a light on while you are
      gone. Always tell neighbors and the building manager when you leave for a
      business trip or vacation.
*** Check Out Your Building
 ***
    * Is there some kind of control over who enters and leaves the building?
    * Are walkways, entrances, parking areas, elevators, hallways, stairways,
      laundry rooms, and storage areas well-lighted, 24 hours a day?
    * Are fire stairs locked from the stairwell side about the ground floor, so
      you can exit but no one can enter?
    * Are mailboxes in a well-traveled, well-lighted area and do they have good
      locks?
    * Are things well maintained--are burnt-out lights fixed properly, shrubs
      trimmed, trash and snow removed?
*** Check Out the Neighbors
 ***
    * Get to know your neighbors. Join or organize an Apartment Watch group so
      neighbors can look out for and help each other.
    * If you live in a large building or complex, think about a tenant patrol
      that watches for crime around the building, provides escort services for
      the elderly and handicapped, and monitors coming and going in the lobby.
    * Work with landlords to sponsor social events for tenants--a Sunday
      breakfast, a picnic, a Halloween Party.
    * Look beyond problems to root causes--does your building need a better
      playground, a social evening for teens, a tenant association, need
      landscaping, a basketball hoop?
    * Work with the landlord for changes that make everyone proud of where they
      live.
**** Street Sense: It's Common Sense
 ****
*** Basic Street Sense ***
Wherever you are - on the street, in an office building or shopping mall,
driving, waiting for a bus or subway - stay alert and tuned in to your
surroundings.

Send the message that you're calm, confident, and know where you're going.

Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, avoid the
person or leave.

Know the neighborhoods where you live and work. Check out the locations of
police and fire stations, public telephones, hospitals, and restaurants, or
stores that are open late.
*** On Foot - Day and Night
 ***
    * Stick to well-traveled streets. Avoid shortcuts through wooded areas,
      parking lots, or alleys.
    * Don't flash large amounts of cash or other tempting targets like
      expensive jewelry or clothing.
    * Carry a purse close to your body, not dangling by the straps. Put a
      wallet in an inside coat or front pants pocket, not a back pocket.
    * Try to use automated teller machines in the daytime. Have your card in
      hand and don't approach the machine if you're uneasy about people nearby.
    * Don't wear shoes or clothing that restrict your movements.
    * Have your car or house key in hand before you reach the door.
    * If you think someone is following you, switch direction or cross the
      street. Walk toward an open store, restaurant, or lighted house. If
      you're scared, yell for help.
    * Have to work late? Make sure there are others in the building, and ask
      someone - a colleague or security guard - to walk you to your car or
      transit stop.
*** On Wheels
 ***
    * Keep your car in good running condition. Make sure there's enough gas to
      get where you're going and back.
    * Always roll up the windows and lock car doors, even if you're coming
      right back. Check inside and out before getting in.
    * Avoid parking in isolated areas. Be especially alert in lots and
      underground parking garages.
    * If you think someone is following you, don't head home. Drive to the
      nearest police or fire station, gas station, or other open business to
      get help.
    * Don't pick up hitchhikers. Don't hitchhike.
    * Leave enough space to pull around the vehicle in front of you when you're
      stopped at a light or stop sign. If anyone approaches your vehicle in a
      threatening manner, pull away.
    * Beware of the "bump and rob." It works like this: A car rear ends or
      bumps you in traffic. You get out to check the damage and the driver or
      one of the passengers jumps into your car and drives off. Look around
      before you get out; make sure other cars or around. If you are uneasy,
      stay in the car and insist on moving to a busy place or police station.
*** On Buses and Subways
 ***
    * Use well-lighted, busy stops.
    * Stay alert! Don't doze or daydream.
    * If someone harasses you, don't be embarrassed. Loudly say "Leave me
      alone!" If that doesn't work, hit the emergency device.
    * Watch who gets off with you. If you feel uneasy, walk directly to a place
      where there are other people.
*** Road Rage
 ***
People are losing their lives on the highway every day because of "road rage."
A majority of drivers get angry when someone cuts them off or tailgates them.
About 70 percent of drivers get angry at slow drivers. Violent incidents on the
road recorded by police have increased 51 percent over the last five years.
    * Don't allow someone to draw you into a test of wills on the highway. If
      someone is tailgating you, pull into the slow lane and let them pass.
      Don't take traffic problems personally.
    * Avoid eye contact with an aggressive driver.
    * Don't make obscene gestures. Use your horn sparingly, as a warning, not
      an outburst.
    * Reduce stress by allowing ample time for your trip and creating a
      relaxing environment in your car.
    * Driving is a cooperative activity. If you're aggressive, you may find
      other drivers trying to slow you down or get in your way.
    * If you witness aggressive driving, stay out of the way and contact
      authorities when you can. Consider carrying a cellular phone in your car
      to contact police in the event of an encounter with an aggressive driver.
*** If Someone Tries To Rob You or Take Your Car ***
    * Don't resist. Give up your property, don't give up your life.
    * Report the crime to the police. Try to describe the attacker accurately.
      Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims.
**** The Hidden Crime: Domestic Violence
 ****
One out of every four women in this country will suffer some kind of violence
at the hands of her husband or boyfriend.

Very few will tell anyone--not a friend, a relative, a neighbor, or the police.

Victims of domestic violence come from all walks of life--all cultures, all
income groups, all ages, all religions. They share feelings of helplessness,
isolation, guilt, fear, and shame.

All hope it won't happen again, but often it does.
*** Are You Abused? Does the Person You Love... ***
    * "Track" all of your time?
    * Constantly accuse you of being unfaithful?
    * Discourage your relationships with family and friends?
    * Prevent you from working or attending school?
    * Criticize you for little things?
    * Anger easily when drinking or on drugs?
    * Control all finances and force you to account in detail for what you
      spend?
    * Humiliate you in front of others?
    * Destroy personal property or sentimental items?
    * Hit, punch, slap, kick, or bite you or the children?
    * Use or threaten to use a weapon against you?
    * Threaten to hurt you or the children?
    * Force you to have sex against your will?
If you find yourself saying yes, it's time to get help.
*** If You Are Hurt, What Can You Do? ***
There are no easy answers, but there are things you can do to protect yourself.
    * Call the police or sheriff. Assault, even by family members, is a crime.
      The police often have information about shelters and other agencies that
      help victims of domestic violence.
    * Leave, or have someone come and stay with you. Go to a battered women's
      shelter--call a crisis hotline in your community or a health center to
      locate a shelter. If you believe that you and your children are in
      danger, leave immediately.
    * Get medical attention from your doctor or a hospital emergency room. Ask
      the staff to photograph your injuries and keep detailed records in case
      you decide to take legal action.
    * Contact your family court for information about a civil protection order
      that does not involve criminal charges or penalties.
*** Don't Ignore The Problem
 ***
    * Talk to someone. Part of the abuser's power comes from secrecy. Victims
      are often ashamed to let anyone know about intimate family problems. Go
      to a friend or neighbor, or call a domestic violence hotline to talk to a
      counselor.
    * Plan ahead and know what you will do if you are attacked again. If you
      decide to leave, choose a place to go; set aside some money. Put
      important papers together--marriage license, birth certificates, check
      books--in a place where you can get them quickly.
    * Learn to think independently. Try to plan for the future and set goals
      for yourself.
*** Have You Hurt Someone In Your Family?
 ***
    * Accept the fact that you violent behavior will destroy you family. Be
      aware that you break the law when you physically hurt someone.
    * Take responsibility for you actions and get help.
    * When you feel tension building, get away. Work off the angry energy
      through a walk, a project, or a sport.
    * Call a domestic violence hotline or health center and ask about
      counseling and support groups for people who batter.
*** The High Costs of Domestic Violence
 ***
    * Men and women who follow their parents' example and use violence to solve
      conflicts are teaching the same destructive behavior to their children.
    * Jobs can be lost or careers stalled because of injuries, arrests, or
      harassments.
    * Lives are lost when violence results in death.
*** Take a Stand! ***
    * Reach out to someone you believe is a victim of family violence, or to
      someone you think is being abusive. Don't give up easily--change takes
      time. Ending the family's isolation is a critical first step.
    * Urge organizations and businesses to raise community awareness by hosting
      speakers on domestic violence, launching public education campaigns, and
      raising funds for shelters and hotlines.
    * Ask the local newspaper, radio station, or television station to examine
      the problem and publicize resources in the community through special
      features and forums.
    * Most communities offer resources for victims of family violence. Check
      your telephone directory or ask a law enforcement agency.
**** Use Common Sense to Spot a Con
 ****
It's not always easy to spot con artists. They're smart, extremely persuasive,
and aggressive.They invade your home through the telephone, computer, and the
mail; advertise in well-known newspapers and magazines; and come to your door.
They're well mannered, friendly, and helpful, at first. Most people think
they're too smart to fall for a scam. But con artists rob all kinds of people,
from investment counselors and doctors to teenagers and senior citizens, of
billions of dollars every year. Cons, scams, and frauds disproportionately
victimize seniors with false promises of miracle cures, financial security, and
luxury prizes. One easy rule to remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it
probably is.
*** You Can Protect Yourself ***
    * Never give a caller your credit card, phone card, Social Security number,
      or bank account number over the phone. It's illegal for telemarketers to
      ask for these numbers to verify a prize or gift.
    * Beware of 900 numbers. Remember, if you call a 900 number to claim a
      "prize," you end up paying for the call. Make sure you understand all
      charges before making the call.
    * Take your time and shop around. Don't let an aggressive con artist
      pressure you into making a decision. Demand information in writing by
      mail. Get a second opinion.Ask your family, friends, and neighbors what
      they think about certain offers.
    * Stay informed about current scams in your area. Contact your attorney
      general's office, district attorney's office, the Better Business Bureau,
      or local consumer affairs office for more information.
    * Remember, you have the right, the ability, and the power to say no! If
      the caller on the other end of the phone makes you wary, be assertive and
      end the conversation. Cons know that the longer they keep you on the
      phone, the higher their chance of success.They often prey on the
      trusting, polite nature of many people or on their excitement over
      getting a supposed prize or bargain. By saying no and hanging up the
      phone, you can prevent a crime from taking place.
*** Be a Wise Consumer
 ***
    * Don't buy health products or treatments that include a promise for a
      quick and dramatic cure, testimonials, imprecise and nonmedical language,
      appeals to emotion instead of reason, or a single product that cures many
      ills.
    * Look closely at offers that come in the mail. Con artists often use
      official-looking forms and language and bold graphics to lure victims. If
      you receive items in the mail that you didn't order, you are under no
      obligation to pay for them.You are free to throw them out, return them,
      or keep them.
    * Beware of cheap home repair work that would otherwise be expensive.The
      con artist may do only part of the work, use shoddy materials and
      untrained workers, or simply take your deposit and never return. Never
      pay with cash. Never accept offers from drive-up workers who "just
      happen" to be in the neighborhood. If they're reliable, they'll come back
      after you check them out.
*** If Someone Rips You Off
 ***
    * Report con games to the police, your city or state consumer protection
      office, district attorney's office, or a consumer advocacy group. Don't
      be embarrassed. Some very, very astute people have been taken in by these
      pros!
    * Call the National Fraud Information Center at 800-876-7060, or visit
      their Web site at www.fraud.org for current fraud alerts.
    * Some Typical Cons Targeted at Older People
Many cons choose to victimize older people. Con artists devise complex offers
that confuse their targets and eventually persuade them to take up these
offers.
*** Don't let this happen to you: ***
The phone rings and the caller tells you that you've won a new car. In order to
claim the prize you need to mail a check to cover the taxes and delivery of the
car. Weeks later, the phone rings again. You learn that the original prize
company has gone out of business. But the caller tells you not to worry because
his/her company has purchased the assets of the defunct company. All you need
to do now is send another check to the new company to cover the costs of the
legal transactions and for immediate delivery of the car. The check gets
mailed, but the prize never arrives.
A mail offer, newspaper, magazine, or television ad catches your eye. It
promises a quick cure for cancer, arthritis, memory loss, back pain, or other
ailments. "It's an absolute miracle," one testimony reads. "I feel a million
times better." You mail your check for a six-week supply of this miracle cure
and wind up with a jar of Vitamin C, placebos, or even worse, pills or tonics
that have not been medically tested and could worsen your condition or react
negatively with the prescription medication you regularly take.
**** Vehicle Burglary - A Crime of Opportunity
 ****
Vehicle Burglary is most often a crime of opportunity. Our own carelessness is
often causing our vehicles to be broken into as well as stolen; however, you
can minimize your chances of being a victim by taking away the opportunity.
*** Here are some tips to remember: ***
    * LOCK your vehicle and take the keys
    * PARK carefully in well lighted areas
    * USE anti-theft devices
    * CLEAN it out; do not leave anything in it
    * REMOVE the garage door opener
    * UTILIZE your garage to park in, if possible
    * MARK it; use an engraver to mark property
    * REPORT suspicious activity or persons to the Sheriff?s Department at 874-
      5115, for crimes in progress call 9-1-1.
*** Lock Up: ***
    * An unlocked car is an open invitation to a car thief. Lock up when you
      leave your car, and take the keys with you.
    * Lock the trunk or tailgate.
    * Close all windows ? professional thieves have tools that unlock cars
      through the smallest openings.
    * Be sure vent or wind-wing windows are shut tight and locked.
    * Lock your car even if you are making a quick stop at the gas station,
      convenience store or mini-mall.
    * At night, park in well-lit areas with lots of people around when out
      running errands.
    * Turn wheels sharply toward the curb when parking, this makes it extra
      difficult for thieves to tow your car.
*** Items to Avoid Leaving in Your Vehicle and/or View: ***
    * Cellular phones and chargers
    * Pagers
    * Cd's
    * Purses/briefcases
    * Wallets
    * Back packs
    * Clothing
    * Laptops/cameras
    * Sports equipment/tools
    * Removable stereos including the removable face plates
*** Operation I.D.: ***
    * With an electric engraver, etch your driver?s license number (preceded by
      the letters ?CA?) on stereo equipment and other valuable items.
    * Record your vehicle identification number (located on a small metal plate
      on the dashboard of newer cars) and store it in a safe place.
    * Keep the vehicle registration in your wallet or purse, not in your car.
    * Use anti-theft devices
    * Consider the purchase and installation of security devices, such as:
    * Interior hood lock release.
    * Second ignition switch or ?kill switch? to prevent electrical current
      from reaching the coil distributor.
    * Fuel switch to prevent fuel from reaching the carburetor.
    * Locking devices for batteries, wheels, decks, etc.
    * Alarm device to activate a siren, horn or lights ? or all three ? to
      frighten the thief away.
    * Device that attaches to the steering wheel or brake pedal.
**** Working Safely at Home
 ****
Increasingly, businesses are allowing their employees to telecommute and
entrepreneurs are running businesses from their homes. Offices are standard in
many homes today and are equipped with the latest in computers, scanners,
printers, faxes, and other expensive equipment. Remember, it is important to
secure yourself and your equipment when you're working from home.
    * Install solid doors and good deadbolt locks on all exterior doors and use
      them.
    * Hang window treatments that obstruct the view into your office. You don't
      want to advertise what equipment you have.
    * Consider installing motion-sensored lighting that will come on if someone
      is walking around your yard.
    * Keep bushes and trees trimmed so that you can see into your yard and
      neighbors can see your house.
    * Install a wide-angle viewer in the door of your home office if it is
      detached from the main house.
    * Look into an alarm system. A basic system can be purchased for less than
      $100, plus a monthly monitoring fee.
    * Keep a cellular phone handy.
    * When meeting a client for the first time, arrange to meet in a public
      place, such as a coffee shop or the library ? not your home.
    * Let someone know when and with whom you have appointments.
    * Review your insurance policy ? almost all policies require an extra rider
      to cover a home office. In the event something does happen, you want to
      be covered.
    * Mark your equipment with identification numbers and keep an updated
      inventory list (with photos, if possible) in a home safe or a bank safe
      deposit box. It's a good idea to keep back-ups of your work in a secure,
      separate location as well.
    * Use the same caution with deliveries as businesses do. Anyone making a
      delivery to your home office should be properly identified before you
      open the door. Do not let the person enter your home.

FORT WAYNE POLICE DEPARTMENT

MISSION STATEMENT
The Fort Wayne Police Department, in partnership with our community, will strive to protect the life, property, and
personal liberties of all individuals. We believe that the overall quality of life for all residents will improve through the
deterrence of criminal activity and an understanding of the diversity of cultures within this community. Furthermore, we
recognize the need for fair and impartial enforcement of the law with attention given the highest possible quality of service
delivery to the community.
For Fiscal Year 2009, the Police Department will seek to replace approximately twelve (12) officers who have been lost
through normal attrition. We also anticipate requesting permission to begin the hiring process for thirty (30) new officers.
This request is driven by and would be contingent on the approval of the proposed “North IV-West” and “North IV-East
annexations, which include neighborhoods in Perry, Cedar Creek, and St. Joseph Townships. If approved, this would result
in the department having an authorized strength of 490 sworn officers.
The department’s sworn and civilian personnel serve in a variety of ways. In addition to our highly visible uniformed first
responders, other employees serve as detectives, lab technicians, undercover investigators, crime scene specialist, academy
staff and administrative support. In addition to their regular duties, many officers also serve on specialized “call-out”
teams.
The department’s main headquarters is at the Police Operations Center located at 1320 East Creighton Avenue. We also
utilize three division outposts. The outposts are located at Fire Station-17 (Getz Road); Fire Station-15 (Lima at Northland);
and the Radio Repair Shop (Coliseum at Parnell). Additionally, we occupy offices at 1900 St. Mary’s Avenue (old academy
building) and the new Public Safety Academy, at Southtown Square.
The following is a brief description of the responsibilities unique to each division. Although they all have their individual
characteristics and issues, they all share the common goal of improving the quality of life in the city of Fort Wayne.
NORTHWEST UNIFORM DIVISION
The Northwest Division provides uniform patrol services to all citizens and businesses within the northwest quadrant of the
city. This division patrols approximately thirty-three square miles and serves a population nearing 64,000 residents. In
addition to a wide range of neighborhoods and small businesses, there are a significant number of industrial parks and large
shopping centers. This quadrant is also home to the Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo and the Memorial Coliseum. Interstate
Highway I-69 traverses the quadrant generating a variety of traffic and visitor safety issues. This division’s Deputy Chief is
also responsible for the Emergency Services Team (SWAT), the Critical Response Team (Hostage Negotiators) and the
Bomb Squad. This D/C also serves as the department’s special events coordinator and vehicle fleet manager.
2009 Priorities: Partner with Narcotics officers to increase highway drug interdiction efforts in an attempt to reduce the
availability of illegal substances moving through our community via our major traffic corridors. This
project will be initiated on a trial basis to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, with the possibility of
developing a more-permanent team if successful.
The Northwest quadrant realized several significant scrap metal thefts in 2008 and is anxious to reduce
future occurrences; however, the ever-increasing value of scrap metals suggests that this type of crime
will continue to rise. The Northwest Division would support the formation of a full-time unit tasked
solely to deal with these types of thefts, as they normally require more surveillance and follow-up than a
typical uniform officer can provide.
NORTHEAST UNIFORM DIVISION
The officers assigned to the Northeast Division patrol nearly twenty-six square miles and serve over 72,000 residents.
Although this quadrant has the largest population in the city, it continues to enjoy the lowest Uniform Crime Report
statistics. Although criminal activity has been traditionally low, new retail development and population changes have
resulted in an increase of criminal activity throughout the quadrant. The Northeast Deputy Chief oversees the three Uniform
Shift Commanders, and is the department’s liaison to the PAL program. The current Northeast Deputy Chief also manages
the department’s team of certified Voice Stress (Truth Detection) operators.
POLICE 1

2009 Priorities: The highest reported crime in the Northeast quadrant is thefts from vehicles. Although the department has
produced public service announcements regarding this problem, too many residents fail to take these
precautionary warnings seriously. Vehicles are left unlocked, with valuable items left in plan view,
making them easy targets for the opportunist. We will continue to analyze these occurrences and attempt
to accurately deploy focused-patrols with the expectation of identifying the perpetrators.
Another Northeast issue is the increasing number of vacant/abandoned properties within the Northside
Neighborhood Association. These properties often suffer from trespassing and vandalism problems
which further escalate their rate of deterioration. Criminal activity tends to follow negligence. We will
increase our interaction with Neighborhood Code Enforcement to address these problems by utilizing
those ordinances designed to encourage property owners to make the necessary improvements.
SOUTHWEST UNIFORM DIVISION
The Southwest Division serves a diversified population of over 70,000 people. The older sections of the quadrant include
portions of the downtown business district, as well as the Historic West-Central Neighborhood, the Fairfield/Creighton area
and the Broadway corridor. The southern sectors of this quadrant include the neighborhoods of Foster Park, Indian Village,
Elmhurst and Waynedale. Two years ago, the Aboite annexation significantly increased the total number square miles to be
patrolled and also resulted in the inclusion of several miles of Interstate-69. The Lutheran Hospital complex, the Fort
Wayne International Airport, the Grand Wayne Center, the Embassy Theater and the Allen County Public Library all result
in a significant draw of non-residents into the quadrant. The Southwest Division Deputy Chief also manages the Fort
Wayne Police Reserve Program and the K9 Program.
2009 Priorities: The Harrison Square project will result in some new public safety challenges for the Southwest Division.
Although some of these “downtown” issues will be shared with the Southeast Division, we anticipate a
significant increase in vehicle and pedestrian traffic during baseball games and other special events. If
these downtown enhancements are to realize their intended success, there will be the need for increased
public safety vigilance to prevent the criminal element from targeting visitors to this area.
The Southwest Division would also like to provide more attention and service to various neighborhood
associations, specifically the combined efforts of the Packard Area Planning Alliance.
SOUTHEAST UNIFORM DIVISION
The officers assigned to the Southeast quadrant provide service to approximately 50,000 residents who live within its 16.5
square miles. The Southeast quadrant encompasses that area of the city that lies south of the Maumee River and east of
Calhoun Street. The northern end of this quadrant includes Headwaters Park and many downtown businesses, and the
south end stretches to the city limits and includes the new Public Safety Academy at Southtown Square. Although the
population and square miles patrolled by this division are the smallest of the other quadrants, their calls-for-service load is
the highest. This quadrant has the largest population of residents who rent, rather than own their home. The Southeast
Division Deputy Chief also oversees the personnel assigned to the Gang Unit and the Crime Prevention program.
2009 Priorities: A continued focus on reducing gang/youth violence. This includes assaults, illegal drug activity and
illegal weapon possession. The officers of the Southeast Division continue work with the Gang Unit to
identify and interact with individuals who are routinely found in the company of suspected gang
members. By staying cognizant of who they are, what they drive, and where they live, we may be
fortunate to prevent some criminal activity, or more-quickly identify and apprehend those who are not
deterred by our intervention efforts.
Continue to improve preliminary investigative efforts to reduce residential burglary occurrences. Assist
the Southwest Division in the analysis, development, and implementation of public safety measures
unique to the new Harrison Square development.
INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT DIVISION
The Investigative Support Division (ISD) provides investigative support to all FWPD officers. ISD is staffed by detectives,
technicians, and civilian personnel who provide long-term follow-up assistance to matters that can’t be handled by the
department’s uniformed first-responders. This division is sub-divided into the Detective Bureau, the Juvenile Aid Section
(and Missing Persons), the Vice and Narcotics Section, the Victim’s Assistance Program, the Evidence and Property
Section, the Crime Analysis Unit, the Police Laboratory, Crime Scene Management, and the Crime Stoppers Office. ISD
personnel routinely interact with the Allen County Prosecutor, Child Protective Services, the Allen County Coroner, and
other regional and federal law enforcement agencies to address the many varied complaints brought by the citizenry and the
business community.
POLICE 2

2009 Priorities: Increase the number of investigators available for complaint follow-up. Recent changes to Indiana
Criminal Code has resulted in the need to re-assign existing personnel to properly address and manage
our Domestic Violence caseload. Domestic related calls for service are the second highest type of
complaint received by the Fort Wayne Police Department, amounting to thousands of calls per year.
Although many of these calls are resolved by our first-responders, a significant number require additional
follow-up to insure proper resolution.
Several technology improvements are also being considered and requested by the Investigative Support
Division. 1.) Increase the number of computers available for their investigators. 2.) Purchase new digital
mapping equipment to produce better detailed crime scene diagrams. 3.) Research available grants and
long-term budgeting strategies for the purchase of a new palm print module for the Automated
Fingerprint Identification System.
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT DIVISION
The Administrative Support Division’s primary responsibilities are those matters that encompass employee and community
education. The Administrative Deputy Chief oversees the recruitment and testing process for new officers, and serves as
the department’s liaison the Indiana Law Enforcement Training Academy and the Public Safety Academy for Northeast
Indiana. Other duties include management of the Crisis Intervention Team (C.I.T) to ensure effective interaction with the
community’s mental health providers. On average, FWPD officers respond to over 900 C.I.T calls per year, with
approximately 400 of them involving the threat or attempt of suicide. The Administrative Support Division also manages
the School Resource Officer Program, the School Child Safety (Safety Village) Program, the Student Police Program, the
Quartermaster/Property Management Officer, and the Hispanic Liaison Program.
2009 Priorities: The Fort Wayne Police Training Center will initiate and complete training for the 16th Lateral Class
comprised of approximately twelve officers. Additionally, four quarterly firearms qualifications, and additional in-service
training will be presented to meet the increased State mandate of 24 hours of on-going education for our 460 officers. A
first-line supervisor course is being developed and will be provided to all sergeants and lieutenants.
CHIEF’S ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF
The Chief’s administrative staff consists of sworn and civilian personnel who assist with the business, property
management and human resource issues inherent to an organization that employs over five hundred people.
The various groups that are part of the Chief’s staff include:
Fiscal Affairs Director/ Payroll
Grants and Research
Neighborhood Response Team
Office of Professional Standards / Internal Affairs
Public Information Officer
Information Systems and Technology Unit (Mobil Data Computers and all PD networks, links, programs, and hardware)
The Chief of Police also oversees the operation of Animal Control and the Communications/Information Systems
Division. Although each group has a separate budget, the Director of each section is answerable to the Chief of Police who
also serves as the co-director of Public Safety. Because of this arraignment, there is additional cost related to the Chief’s
(and his staff’s) time to attend meetings, prepare reports or participate in the hiring, disciplining, and termination of these
non-police employees. These two groups are responsible for a combined total of approximately 130 additional employees.
The Communications/Information Systems Division consists of the 911 Communications Center, the Police Information
Desk/ Records Section, and the Radio Repair Shop.

2013

The Fort Wayne Police Department continues to be committed to the philosophy of partnering with the community to reduce crime and improve the quality of life in our
neighborhoods.
Vehicles continue to be the largest acquisition request of the Fort Wayne Police Department. With the unknown tax situation, we have scaled back our purchases for this 5
year CIP cycle. It is unknown how the increased mileage on vehicles will impact our nontarge budget costs. In years 2009 and 2010, we add additional vehicles for the new
classes hired in 2007 who are eligible for take home vehicles. All other vehicles being requested are for replacement and have exceeded the indicators for replacement.
Computer crimes have become one of the fastest growing crimes. In order to investigate these crimes it will require additional specialty computers and software.
The department’s need for miscellaneous equipment continues each year with requests for additional and/or replacement equipment. All requests are for items that will assist
the department in deterring and solving crimes, and providing safety for our employees and citizens we serve.

pp
,
o the name and address of each parcel and
owner of land within the proposed district and
a description
p
of the current zoning
g and land
use classification for each parcel,

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.
o a detailed description of the economic
improvement projects to be carried out within
the district and the estimated cost of the
projects and the benefits to accrue to the
property owners within the district, a plan for
the application of assessment revenue to the
cost of the projects, a proposed formula for
determining the percentage of total benefit to
be received by each parcel of property within
the district,
district
o the number of years in which assessments will
be levied, and
proposed
p
list of members for the EID Board
oap

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.

•

•

Petition must be signed by a majority of the
owners of real property within the proposed
district and must be signed by the owners of real
property constituting more than fifty percent
(50%) off the
h assessed
d valuation
l
i
in
i the
h proposed
d
district
After receiving a petition, the City-County Council
publishes
bli h notice
ti off a public
bli h
hearing
i
on the
th
proposed EID and mails a copy of the notice to
each owner of real property within the proposed
EID
City-County Council Conducts Public Hearing

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.

•

After the public hearing the City-County Council
may adopt an ordinance establishing the EID if it
determines that:
o the requirements of the petition have been
met,
o the projects to be undertaken will provide
special benefits to property owners and the
projects are of public utility and benefit,
o the benefits provided will be new benefits and
do not replace benefits already existing in the
district before the establishment of the EID,
and

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.
o the formula to be used for the assessment of
benefits is appropriate
o An ordinance must also establish an economic
improvement board (the “Board”) appointed by the
legislative body with at least three members, a
majority of whom must own property within the
EID; after February 28, 2010, an EID must have at
l
least
t one (1) parcell off reall property
t that
th t is
i nott
owned by an owner of other parcels of real property
in the EID

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.
o Method of Assessment
• Basis for Apportionment: The benefits accruing to
property within the EID may be apportioned on
any basis reasonably representative of the
diffusion of the benefits from the projects within
the district, including:
o the proximity of the parcel to the projects,
o the accessibility of the parcel to the projects,
o the true cash value of the parcel,

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.

•

•

o the true cash value of any improvement on
the
h parcel,
l
o the age of any improvement on the parcel,
and
o any other
th similar
i il ffactors
t
The assessments may be adjusted according to
the zoning classification of the property, and up
to three (3) distinct apportionment zones may be
established within an EID if the benefit of the
projects to the properties varies between areas of
the district
The EID ordinance must approve the proposed
apportionment formula

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.

•
•
•

After approval of the ordinance, the Board must,
using
i
the
h approvall apportionment
i
formula,
f
l
determine the percentage of benefits to be
received by each parcel within the district
The Board then applies this percentage to the
total amount that is to be defrayed by special
assessment within the district to determine the
special assessment for each parcel
Upon making this determination, the Board must
mail notice to each owner of property within the
district stating:
o the
th amountt off the
th proposed
d special
i l
assessment,

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.
o that the proposed special assessment on each
parcell off property within
i hi the
h district
di i is
i on file
fil
and available for inspection in the Board’s
office,
o the time and place where written
remonstrances against the special assessment
may be filed,
o the time and p
place where the Board will hear
any owner who has filed a written
remonstrance, and
o that the Board may, after hearing evidence,
i
increase,
d
decrease or leave
l
unchanged
h
d the
th
amount of special assessment

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.

•

After hearing all remonstrances,
remonstrances the Board must
make a determination on each assessment by
increasing, decreasing or confirming each special
assessment
• The EID assessments are liens on the real
property that is assessed in the EID, second only
to ad valorem property taxes
o Action Contesting Validity: Any owner of real
property in an EID may file an action contesting the
validity of an adopted ordinance establishing an EID
or the special assessment schedule; such action
must be filed within thirty (30) days after adoption
of the ordinance or special assessment schedule and
must be filed in the circuit or superior court of the
county in
i which
hi h the
h EID is
i llocated
d

Economic Improvement Districts, con’t.
o Practical Use of EID Funds
• All assessments collected are paid to the Board
and deposited in an economic improvement fund,
which may only be used for the purposes
specified in the ordinance creating the EID
• By November 1 of each year, the Board must
prepare and submit an annual budget to the CityCounty Council for approval, modification or
rejection; any expenditure by the Board must be
included in the approved budget or otherwise
approved
db
by the
th City-County

Why do communities want
“economic development” ???
Jobs, wages, increased local spending,
economic diversification & build tax base

Why is economic development
important for schools and local
go ernment?
government?
• Property tax caps limit property taxes paid by taxpayers
and limit property tax revenues available to fund local
services.
• Property tax revenues decreased over $500 million statewide due to tax
caps
• Once the tax limit is reached,
reached increases in property tax rates are no longer
funded, except certain obligations approved through local referenda

• Decline in state income tax collections over the last
three years
• Reduced revenues for operating, infrastructure and property tax relief

• Increasingg costs
• 2007 – 2011 increases: gas 18%, electricity 19%, medical 15%
•36

Short and Long term solutions
• Cut costs and improve operational efficiencies
• Grow property tax base and income tax base
– Growing property tax base at or above growth in property tax
levies will stabilize, or reduce, property tax rates and property
tax revenues lost to the property tax caps
– Growing income tax base at or above the rate of inflation will
provide a reliable revenue source to pay competitive wages and
meet the growing needs of constituents

• Leverage private investment
• Find and leverage additional sources of funds
37

Why do we offer incentives for economic
development?
•

Encourage new business investment to increase
our local and state tax base, reduce tax burden,
reduce property taxes lost due to tax caps

•

Encourage job creation or retention

•

Target: specific industries or market segments,
geographic areas, low‐income

•

Competition among alternative sites

p ope ty owners
o
e s pay
additional tax; can make property more
expensive and less competitive;

•

Must establish Board,, annual budgets
g

•

Require petition of majority of property owners
to establish EID; hearing, etc.

•

Apportionment formula; on
on-going
going
administration

•

May not be economically feasible

•

Limited revenue makes bonds difficult to
market; may need credit enhancement or other
sources of revenue

1. Vaccine package inserts and the full ACIP recommendations for these vaccines should be consulted for additional information on vaccine-related contraindications and precautions and for more information on
vaccine excipients. Events or conditions listed as precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and risks for administering a specific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should be considered. If the
risk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vaccine should not be administered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the risk, the vaccine should be administered. A contraindication
is a condition in a recipient that increases the chance of a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, a vaccine should not be administered when a contraindication is present.
2. For more information on use of influenza vaccines among persons with egg allergies and a complete list of conditions that CDC considers to be reasons to avoid receiving LAIV, see CDC. Prevention and control of
seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — United States, 2014–15 Influenza Season. MMWR 2014;63(32):691–97.
3. LAIV, MMR, varicella, or zoster vaccines can be administered on the same day. If not administered on the same day, live vaccines should be separated by at least 28 days.
4. Immunosuppressive steroid dose is considered to be >2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg of prednisone or the equivalent. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 1 month after discontinuation of such therapy.
Providers should consult ACIP recommendations for complete information on the use of specific live vaccines among persons on immune-suppressing medications or with immune suppression because of other
reasons.
5. Vaccine should be deferred for the appropriate interval if replacement immune globulin products are being administered. See CDC. General recommendations on immunization: recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR 2011;60(No. RR-2). Available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html.
6. Measles vaccination might suppress tuberculin reactivity temporarily. Measles-containing vaccine may be administered on the same day as tuberculin skin testing. If testing cannot be performed until after the day
of MMR vaccination, the test should be postponed for at least 4 weeks after the vaccination. If an urgent need exists to skin test, do so with the understanding that reactivity might be reduced by the vaccine.
* Adapted from CDC. Table 6. Contraindications and precautions to commonly used vaccines. General recommendations on immunization: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices. MMWR 2011;60(No. RR-2):40–41 and from Atkinson W, Wolfe S, Hamborsky J, eds. Appendix A. Epidemiology and prevention of vaccine preventable diseases. 12th ed. Washington, DC: Public Health

technology trend that we hope to be able to provide is patron access to their accounts and
catalog access through the library website Our website is currently blocked by our firewall and we
have plans to correct that We also plan to work with Brett Stowell to help us manage and update our
website Once that is done we can purchase software that will allow patrons access to our catalog

community There is a lack of space now to offer anything other than programs for
children but in the future the library would like to bring in authors and guest speakers on a variety of

personnel and community members developed a School
Improvement Plan that was presented to the Board However there is no
money from the State that helps the school to implement any programs to
address ideas in the

plan

Improvement

Plan calls for additional

help for those
danger of not

students who did not pass the exit exam or who are in
passing the exam Specifically the plan calls for 2 additional

instructional aides

for 1 calendar year to help with
remediation efforts Due to the cuts at the state level and the number of

The Board has taken steps and is in the process of taking other steps

and the county to allow some
flexibility to the Endowment Board to make some decisions in regard to
funding possible programs at the school We are not asking the Councils

we are

asking

possible solution

is to allow the Endowment Board the flexibility to

within the School Corporation The Endowment Board could then make

regarding school grants The majority of the money would
still be applied towards debt and scholarships A report could also be
made at this time of the year to the joint boards regarding what special
projects were funded during the past year
