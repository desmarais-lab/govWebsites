ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Economic Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Wednesday,
February 1, 2006. Chair Jackie Nytes called the meeting to order at 5:05 p.m. with the
following members present: Patrice Abduallah, Lonnell Conley, Marilyn Pfisterer, Isaac
Randolph, Jr., and Joanne Sanders. Absent was Virginia Cain. Representing Council
staff was Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer.
PROPOSAL NO. 32, 2006 – reappoints George Pillow to the Indianapolis Economic
Development Commission
Chair Nytes said that Mr. Pillow could not attend the meeting tonight due to a previously
scheduled meeting.
Councillor Conley moved, seconded by Councillor Sanders, to “Postpone” Proposal No.
32, 2006 until March 22, 2006. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
Discussion regarding the impact of the end of the Inventory Tax – presentation and
testimonies will be heard
Chair Nytes said that this is the first of a series of discussions about how to deal with the
impact of the end of the Inventory Tax. She said that the Committee was very interested
in having this happen because it was a good thing to help businesses, especially as efforts
are made to develop Indianapolis in the logistics industry. However, like all good things,
there are consequences that require decisions on how to deal with them. She distributed a
packet to the Committee (Exhibit A) of articles and research materials from the Internet
that review why Inventory Tax was ended in Indiana and what was to be accomplished.
She said that it was a notion of trying to create a more competitive business climate. But
now the Council has a couple of options of how to deal with the impact of the loss in
assessed valuation on the tax base.
Mr. Brown distributed a handout to be presented by himself and Bob Clifford, Controller.
Mr. Brown’s presentation highlighted the following keypoints:
• Total Assessed Valuation (AV) of the Indianapolis Police Service District
represented by the shaded area of slide 1 and the Inventory AV for 2004 payable
in 2005
o 6.7% of all AV reported last year was inventory
• Total AV of the Indianapolis Fire Service District represented by the shaded area
of slide 2 and the Inventory AV for 2004 payable in 2005
o 5.5% of all AV reported last year was inventory
• Total AV for Solid Waste District, which is almost the entire county minus
excluded cities and other conservatory districts, is displayed in slide 3
o 4.9% of all AV reported last year was inventory
• Total AV for the Consolidated City, which is the entire county minus excluded
cities and towns, is displayed in slide 4
o 4.9% of all AV reported last year was inventory

•

Total AV, broken down by townships, is represented in slide 5
o The two with the highest Inventory AV for last year were Warren at 8.4%
and Pike at 6.3%; the trend shall continue in 2006.

Councillor Randolph asked what is in Warren Township that would warrant the 8.4%.
Mr. Brown said that he talked with Councillor Vernon Brown regarding this issue and
was informed that there are quite a few dealerships along Shadeland Avenue; Visteon is
in that district, the old GP plant that has a lot of warehousing, and a couple of malls.
Although Eastgate is closed, they were still included in 2004 and 2005.
Councillor Nytes asked Mr. Brown to explain some of the townships and what is going
on in their areas. Mr. Brown said that he is unsure of how all the Inventory is accounted
for, but Wayne Township has Rolls Royce in its district, and Eli Lilly is in Center
Township.
Councillor Pfisterer commented that she thinks that the AV for Wayne Township would
be higher if the non-airline related businesses were put back on the tax role as they should
be. Mr. Brown said that is a case throughout the county, as every county has non-taxable,
tax exempt property, and he believes that Center Township and Wayne Township have
the highest proportion on those with the Airport and Government buildings. Councillor
Pfisterer said that her point is that there are a number of non-airline related businesses,
such as fast food restaurants, car dealerships, daycare centers, etc., that are tax exempt
because they happen to be on the property.
Chair Nytes said that it is interesting that non-airline related businesses enjoy the tax
exempt status because of the land on which they are located. Councillor Pfisterer said
that there have been a number of developments that have been built on airport designated
land and are leasing to other companies. Even the leases are lower because of not being
taxed. Chair Nytes asked if this is to stimulate development around the airport or because
the airport wanted to have something happen on the land to hold it until they needed it.
Mr. Clifford said that there has been quite a bit of time spent looking into that. He said
that in the last ten years, the airport has purchased about $24 million worth of property.
He said that he is unaware of any car dealers that benefit from the tax exempt status, but
there is a fast food restaurant in question because it is on airport property. He said that he
does not know of any businesses that are non-airport related that are inventory based.
Councillor Conley asked if the leases for five or ten years are a one shot deal or if
continuations are allowed. Mr. Clifford said that they vary. The airport purchases land
because of Noise Abatement and Federal law and the airport does not allow housing back
on the land. The airport maintains the land to protect itself against possible future
violations of Noise Abatements. He said that Garland Graves, Director of
Administration, could probably better answer any questions regarding these issues.
Councillor Randolph asked how Inventory would be classified for the sake of this
discussion. Mr. Clifford answered that it is finished goods. He said that in 2003 raw
materials were rolled off of the assessed valuations as part of the restructuring. The

Economic Development
February 1, 2006
Page 4

Legislature wanted to transition this, so it left finished goods AV to transition off in
assessed 2006, pay 2007. Chair Nytes asked if this has been phased in its
implementation. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative.
Mr. Clifford referenced Exhibit B, also distributed by Mr. Brown, and stated that the first
page explains how much of the countywide levy is affected by the loss of AV. He said
that it is currently a levy of about $61 million and how much it will affect the tax rate
depends on which district and which taxing entity it is. [Clerk’s note: A full printout of
Exhibit B is on file in the Council office with the original set of minutes.] Mr. Clifford
said that the second page of Exhibit B is a calculation of the Economic Development
Income Tax (EDIT) rate that will be required to replace the increase in levy for
homesteaders. He said that the loss of AV will essentially cause tax rates to increase for
everyone else and, under existing State law, the Council is allowed to adopt this special
EDIT rate to offset the impact of the shift of inventory and decrease the income tax to
give a credit to homeowners. He said that it is estimated that the amount of the credit in
will be about $16.7 million in 2006, which reflects a new income tax of about one-tenth
of a percent. Mr. Clifford said that last year the County Option Income Tax (COIT) was
allowed to increase to .8%.
Councillor Sanders asked if the tax rate applies to both businesses and individuals. Mr.
Clifford answered that it is only individual income tax.
Chair Nytes asked if the point of the EDIT is to create a homestead credit to offset the
amount of the increase that homeowners would have picked up, which would be the $16
million. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative. Mr. Clifford referenced the third
column of Exhibit B, page 2, that has a box around it. He said that it is Inventory tax
dollars and totals $53 million, of which tax payers actually pay for levy. He said that the
difference between this $53.3 million and the $61.4 million on the first page is what the
State pays to property tax replacement credits.
Chair Nytes asked if a community chose to deal with the change by simply letting the
levy spread over the rest of the property tax base, if the State would still be responsible
for paying its share. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Sanders asked what the one-tenth of a percent of the EDIT generates. Mr.
Clifford answered that it generates about $17 million.
Mr. Clifford said that the remainder of Exhibit B is a summary of the estimated tax rate
that will be required from each of the taxing districts in the county. It essentially shows
that there is between 2.9% to 8.9% increase in tax rates because of the loss of finished
goods inventory as part of the AV. The numbers are based on the 2004 levy paid in
2005. Mr. Clifford said that House Bill (HB) 1001 of the Legislature will restrict an
increase in residential tax rates to 3% except for debt service and construction.
Therefore, some of the taxing districts may be restricted from going beyond 3%, which
would have a detrimental impact to the City and the County. HB 1204 now has a

Economic Development
February 1, 2006
Page 5

provision that would create a homestead credit for renters. There is not a good estimate
of how many renters there are.
Chair Nytes asked if there is anything in place to help offset businesses. Mr. Clifford
answered that he is not aware of anything.
Kelly Bentley, Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) Board, discussed information in Exhibit
C (attached). She said that there are five property tax funds for Indianapolis Public
Schools, but transportation operating is broken out from school replacement because one
has a fixed rate and the other one does not. She said that the school pension debt service
is also listed separately. Ms. Bentley said that Exhibit C illustrates the 2005 Calendar tax
rate for each fund, the estimated AV loss, and the estimated levy loss. She said that the
fifth column indicates whether or not IPS is able to raise the rate to recover the specific
funds. However, the school funding formula for the General Fund will shift the
responsibility to the State; as the AV goes down, the State portion goes up. Ms. Bentley
said that the only two funds in which the rates can be raised are the debt service and
school bus replacement, and the remainder reflects money that will be lost due to fixed
rates.
Chair Nytes asked if this model would apply to all public school districts in Marion
County. Ms. Bentley answered in the affirmative but stated that township schools
probably will not have as much of an impact because they will experience a lower
percent loss of AV. However, Pike and Warren may be impacted on a higher level due to
their percent loss of AV.
Chair Nytes asked if there is anything about the distribution of the EDIT to assist schools.
Mr. Brown answered that there is nothing to help replace what is lost.
Jeff Conrad, Indy Partnership, said that it was discovered that the Inventory Tax was
considered an archaic type of technique, as many states had wiped out the technique and
some replaced it with more diverse techniques. He said that as Indy Partnership visited
400-500 of the existing businesses, they asked how the businesses would be impacted by
the Inventory Tax. He said that concern depended on the industry cluster and industry
structure of the company. For example, in 2002 Reebok bought out Athletic Indy
Partnership and met with the new company to retain the business. The buyers were
looking to move the company to Nashville, Tennessee as part of their strategy. He said
that there were two key factors: one was the discussion of eliminating Inventory Tax,
which would make a huge impact on the company’s ability to do business in Indiana and
compete with other markets; second was the company’s workforce. There were 500-550
trained employees on the Eastside of Indianapolis, which helped influence the company
to stay in the original location, and it is prospering at about 900 full-time employees.
Mr. Conrad said that when Indy Partnership talks to site consultants, there will be
requests for certain types of opportunities, and some of the consultants indicate that the
end of Inventory Tax is a key factor. The site consultants are very influential in the way
that opportunities are assessed for clients. Mr. Conrad said that many companies wanted

Economic Development
February 1, 2006
Page 6

to know what needed to be done with regard to the end of Inventory Tax in Indianapolis.
These companies were concerned about what their state and local tax liability will be
regarding operating costs. He said that it may not have a huge impact on all industries,
but the non-retail driven companies will be impacted. Indy Partnership believes that it
will be a positive venture with respect to the thrust on motorsports. He said that although
the inventory on motorsport equipment is not usually vast, it is extremely expensive and
highly assessed because the value associated with the items is unique. Therefore, the end
of Inventory Tax can be used as a sales tool and will hopefully create new investment due
to liability not being placed directly upon companies. Some existing businesses, if in
growth or potential relocation mode, must be considering the end of Inventory Tax in
their overall operating costs. Mr. Conrad said that Indy Partnership visited about 50
companies in three days at the end of 2004, and the companies that had a large capacity
of inventory were excited about the end of Inventory Tax. Companies that were more on
the technology or Information Technology and Life Sciences side were more interested in
the time zone issue.
Councillor Abduallah asked what incentives or tools may attract other businesses while
also returning dividends to Indianapolis. Mr. Conrad said that the goal is to look at the
overall economic impact; direct, what the company will create by the opportunity of
purchasing additional goods and services; indirect, what a business benefits from buying
from another business; and consumer related, the benefit of a company hiring 100 people
resulting in disposable income for consumers to go back and spent. Mr. Conrad said that
another incentive reflects if there is an opportunity for a company’s business to grow,
retain, and expand.
CONCLUSION
With no further business, and upon motion duly made, the Economic Development
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:49 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE
The Public Safety Committee of the City-County Council met on Wednesday, June 15, 2011. Chair
Benjamin Hunter called the meeting to order at 5:33 p.m. with the following members present: Vernon
Brown, Aaron Freeman, Mary Moriarty Adams, William Oliver, Christine Scales and Ryan Vaughn.
Absent was Marilyn Pfisterer. Representing Council staff was Robert Elrod, General Counsel.
Chair Hunter asked all members to introduce themselves and state which district they represent.
PROPOSAL NO. 158, 2011 - appoints Maggie Lewis to the Early Intervention Planning Council
Chair Hunter said that Councillor Pfisterer wholeheartedly endorses and supports Councillor Lewis’
appointment to this board. He said that both Councillors have had a long history with the Planning
Council.
Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to forward Proposal No. 158, 2011 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 299, 2010 - amends the Code to add a new Chapter 986 to establish standards for
security companies doing business in Marion County, including licensing by the Office of Finance and
Management to include criminal background checks and experience requirements
Chair Hunter said that the digest is incorrect, and he did speak to Councillor Joanne Sanders, but he
asked Councillor Vaughn to explain her request.
Councillor Vaughn said that he talked to Councillor Sanders, who has been working on a proposed
amendment with Councillor Jack Sandlin. He said they both wanted the amendment to be available
tonight, but they are both out of town. He said he believes they relatively agree on the amendment
language, and Councillor Sanders asked that the proposal be passed to the full Council, with
amendments offered on the floor by Councillor Sandlin.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Oliver, to forward Proposal No. 299, 2010
to the full Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-1,
with Councillor Freeman casting the negative vote.
PROPOSAL NO. 84, 2011 - amends certain provisions of the current merit system respecting the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and the Indianapolis Fire Department
Councillor Brown said that this proposal expands the Merit Board, making it compliant with State Code.
He said it also makes some changes to the hiring and promotional processes in the police and fire
departments. He said this proposal is non-political and Councillor Vaughn has tremendously helped
with some of the language. He said some concerns were expressed from the Indianapolis Professional
Firefighters Union Local 416, and he agrees with their suggested changes. Councillor Brown said he has
also heard that some Councillors have concerns and questions about the proposal, but he has not been
approached by anyone; although he has expressed his willingness to work with any Councillor on the

Members of the Public Safety Committee
June 15, 2011
Page 2
process. He said that this proposal was going to be amended on the Council floor, but they decided not
to do so, and he thought that other amendments would be offered today.
Councillor Brown said that the fire union suggested removing the language “shall belong to the same
political party” in Section 252-201 (a)(4), because they elect their membership, and political party is not
a factor in that election process. He said, with respect to Section 252-202 (4) (c) (i), his intent was to
give people who live in Marion County or have five years of contiguous residency status points in the
application process, because they have a commitment and ties to the community and because they are
familiar with the community. He said Bruce Henry, Human Resources (HR) Director, and his
consultants decided to do an applicant candidate profile that included some things that they felt would be
good qualities (as listed in this section). The fire union feels that a few things should be added and
removed from this list, including:

• Striking the certification from the National Fire Academy, as very few civilians go to the
Academy, because it is for incumbent firefighters.
• Striking the five years creditable service.
Councillor Brown said that Chair Hunter suggested, and he agrees, that instead of striking these things
completely, maybe they can be included elsewhere. Councillor Brown said that he proposes that
language be added in this particular section saying that the final candidate profile could be expanded
based upon the recommendations of the department and the consultant, and signed off on or approved by
the respective merit board. He said the promotional process changes depending on what the consultant
and the Merit Board indicate are the needs of the department. He said they have several firefighters that
speak and write Spanish fluently, because they are Hispanic, but they do not get credit. This is not fair,
when a certified bi-lingual translator can receive credit.

Councillor Vaughn asked if Councillor Brown wants to amend Sec. 252-202 (4)(c) to state that the
applicant candidate profile “may include, but is not limited to,” and then list some of the criteria.
Councillor Brown answered in the affirmative. Councillor Vaughn asked if he then wants it to state that
the Merit Board will make the final decision as to what criteria will be used to give someone preference.
Councillor Brown answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Brown said the fire union also suggested that instead of giving a maximum of five points,
they should give the points in percentage form, with a maximum of five percent. He said that it has
historically been a 100-point process, but that could change. Councillor Brown said that this is simple
language change and could be offered on the Council floor if everyone is in agreement.

Councillor Vaughn asked Bill Owensby, President, Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), if changing the
number of maximum points from five to five percent makes sense on the police merit side as well. Mr.
Owensby said that this is more of a question for Mr. Henry in HR.
Ron Kautsky, Vice President, Local 416, said that Councillor Brown hit on most of their concerns, which
are technical in nature. He said that tracking the maximum points in percentage form keeps it more inline with the merit process. He said they do not have a problem with listing the other things, such as
residency and language, as additional criteria outside of the initial preferences, but those things would be
up to HR and the Merit Board.

Members of the Public Safety Committee
June 15, 2011

Councillor Oliver said that there is some consistency in the language with respect to residency, as this is
done in many aspects and areas. He said incentives are often offered to those who live in a community
because they bear the burden of supporting the structures in that community. For example, students are
given tax breaks or tuition credits for attending a college or university in their home state. He said he
hopes this proposal is supported in totality.
Councillor Scales said that this proposal has evolved quite a bit since it was first introduced. She said
she spoke with some stakeholders that she thought would be impacted by this proposal, such as the
Local 416 and the FOP. The impression that she has received was that most of those stakeholders do not
feel that the system is broken or needs to be changed. She said that she is not sure if she could vote for
it since there does not seem to be a significant need for the change. Councillor Brown said that he has
had many conversations with some of the firefighters and they seem to be okay with the ordinance, and
he has not gotten any opposition. He said that most of the concern that he has received has been from
other Councillors.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked if the current ordinance is in compliance with the State Statute.
Councillor Brown answered in the negative. Councillor Vaughn said that this is unclear, as state law
requires that the FOP and the local have a third of the votes, which is not currently the case. He said
they are not sure how the City got to this point and if the City is legal, based upon how it reached this
status. He said Mr. Elrod has done some research on the issue, and in essence there was a statute that
stated that a city could adopt a merit board that looked like “a” or it could re-adopt the current merit
board that looks like “b” by a certain date. Marion County adopted its current merit board, and over the
course of time, the City sought to amend the configuration of that Merit Board. He said there was then a
question of whether or not “b” had been amended so much that that the City was in violation of it, and
were now required to adopt “a.” Simultaneously, there was legislation that stated that the City “shall”
amend the board, so that the locals have a third of the vote. Councillor Vaughn said that he, Councillor
Brown, Mr. Elrod and others discussed this, and have determined that they will likely not know with
certainty which one is legal until there is some sort of suit, binding opinion or clarifying legislation.
Councillor Moriarty Adams asked if the Council is close to being in compliance. Councillor Vaughn
answered that this proposal would bring the City closer to being in compliance, because it clearly meets
the definition of the locals having a third of the vote. He said another issue that has not been discussed
in committee is whether or not the locals are compelled to ratify the proposal by their own vote. Mr.
Elrod said that the original statute said that a city could either go under the statutory system or keep the
one they had, and Indianapolis kept the one they had. When the City attempted to expand it, the
Attorney General’s Office and a court case concluded that if the City kept the old one, it could not be
changed. He said then some changes were made, and it is questionable as to whether the City had the
authority to do so. Mr. Elrod said with the police merger, a new merit system was adopted that is not
anywhere close to any of the others. He said the statute states that if the City adopts a new system, it has
to be the statutory system, which is not like anything the City has ever had. In addition, it states that if a
new system is adopted, the departments have a right to have a referendum on that new system.
Therefore, if this is merely a correction of keeping the historical system, which the City is permitted to
do, then the City is okay. If not, it most likely has to go to the referendum of the departments. Mr.
Elrod said that the good thing with this proposal is that it keeps the current boards in place until
December 31, 2011. Therefore, if it passes, and there is opposition, those people have six months to
question the legality of the new system before the boards change.

Members of the Public Safety Committee

Councillor Vaughn said they do not have the amendment in draft form tonight, and the Public Safety
Director has quite a bit of technical changes to suggest. He apologized to Councillor Brown for not
discussing some of these issues with him, and said that he thinks it makes sense to incorporate the
changes in an amendment to be entertained in committee. He said it may also make sense to include that
it takes effect upon ratification of the locals. This would avoid the legal question altogether.
Councillor Scales asked Councillor Brown how he feels about this. Councillor Brown answered that he
does not have any issues with this. He said that he has not seen any proposed changes by the Public
Safety Director and he has also been told that the attorney for Mayor Greg Ballard would like to speak
with him, but he has not heard from him either. He said he would be happy to speak with anyone about
the proposal. He said with respect to the ratification, he and some of the fire union people do not feel
that it is necessary. Councillor Vaughn said that it is a possibility that it is not necessary, but his thought
was that it would be easier to put in the stipulation as opposed to having someone in the Court of
Appeals make the decision.

Councillor Vaughn moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 84, 2011 until
June 29, 2011. Councillor Brown asked that if there are any persons that have questions about the
proposal, that they please contact one of the five sponsors of the proposal. The motion to postpone
carried by a vote of 7-0.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety Committee of the CityCounty Council was adjourned at 6:09 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
November 27, 2007. Chair Joanne Sanders called the meeting to order at 5:07 p.m. with the
following members present: Paul Bateman, Vernon Brown, Lynn McWhirter, and Jackie Nytes.
Lincoln Plowman arrived shortly thereafter. Absent was Lance Langsford.
PROPOSAL NO. 425, 2007 - urges the Council to consider a reduction in the amount of the
property tax levy needed to generate the tax increment replacement amount as determined
pursuant to I.C. 6-1.1-21-11(b) in certain tax districts
Chair Sanders asked the Committee to postpone the proposal to the next meeting. Councillor
Brown moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 425, 2007 until
December 11, 2007. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
[Clerk’s note: Councillor Plowman arrived at 5:08 p.m.]
PROPOSAL NO. 498, 2007 - appropriates $30,000 in the 2007 Budget of the Perry Township
Assessor (County General Fund) due to errors in correctly calculating personal services
appropriations
Kathy Price, Perry Township Assessor, distributed a handout (attached as Exhibit A), which illustrates
the reasons why the Perry Township Assessor is short in their Character 01 budget. She said that they
will not be able to meet payroll until the end of 2007. Ms. Price discussed the points in Exhibit A, and
stated that the reference to no surprises refers to not having employees leaving or any additional
payouts. She said that she that she will be about $25,801.08 short for payroll, but she is asking for
$30,000 as a cushion to cover any unforeseen surprises. She said that if there are any additional funds
left over, they will go back into the budget.
Chair Sanders asked if the new payment amounts indicated in Exhibit A for health insurance will
make up the difference. Ms. Price answered in the affirmative. Jerry Roseberry, Chief Deputy, Perry
Township Assessor’s Office, said that the insurance amount given was in case of any changes in
familial status due to plan changes for the new benefit year.
Councillor Nytes stated that there are several references in Exhibit A to a third pay period, and she
asked if knowledge of a third pay is something that can be identified in advance. Bob Clifford, City
Controller, said that there is a third pay in November this year. He said that he believes that the
budget may have essentially been put together without including the third pay in November. He said
that Hope Tribble, Budget Manager, Office of Finance and Management (OFM), has looked over the
Perry Township Assessor’s budget, and it does appear to be about $30,000 short. Councillor Nytes
asked if the requested amount will cover the third pay. Ms. Price answered in the affirmative. Mr.
Clifford said in reference to whether people terminate between now and the end of the year, if
someone terminates after December 16, 2007, it would not affect this year’s cash budget, because it
would be a January 3, 2008 payroll issue.

Administration and Finance Committee

Chair Sanders said that Exhibit A states that there have been no amounts allotted to give additional
payments to employees, and she asked if that suggests that there will not be any bonus payouts given.
Ms. Price answered in the affirmative.
Councillor Brown asked Mr. Price how many Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) she has in her office.
Ms. Price answered that she has 12 FTEs. Councillor Brown asked if she did not initially budget
enough money in her Character 01 to pay her employees for the full year. Ms. Price answered that
she did budget enough to pay them. Councillor Brown asked what has caused the shortfall that will
also require Ms. Price to return for an additional appropriation in 2008. Mr. Clifford re-stated
Councillor Brown’s question and stated that there is wage control in which insurance, benefits, and
salaries for each employee are anticipated. Mr. Roseberry answered that their office gave $110,800 of
their Character 01 funds back to help other townships and to cover budget shortfalls in County
Reassessment funds for 2007. He said that during that time they had two employees that began
working at the end of 2006, and they were trying to calculate their budget to cover those costs, but
there was honestly not enough to cover the expenses. Mr. Roseberry said that they tried to request the
funds for 2008, but they were told that it was too late to correct it, and they would have to come
before the Committee to request an appropriation. Councillor Brown said that he understands that
sometimes the Controller’s Office operates the budget to average out if a department’s staff fluctuates,
but the Perry Township Assessor’s office was under-funded this year and will have the same 12
employees next year. Mr. Clifford said that at this point there is nothing that can be done for the 2008
Budget, except to put it on the “To Do” list for corrections in 2008. He added that it is always easier
for a larger department or agency to manage the departure and arrival of new employees, and it is
always the smaller departments or agencies that have a problem managing a budget that is contracted
the way they are for all smaller agencies, as they tend to run short when there are no vacancies or
turnovers during the year.
Councillor Nytes asked if the Perry Township Assessor’s Office examined their Characters 02, 03,
and 04 to ensure that there are no funds available to transfer to their Character 01. Mr. Clifford
answered that there is not much available in any other Character of any of the agencies or
departments. He said that there may be some under-spending from other township assessors, but it is
easier at this point to appropriate out of fund balance than to take the funds from another agency.
Councillor Nytes asked if the other eight township assessor’s offices will make it through the
remainder of the year with their budgets. Ms. Tribble answered in the affirmative, and stated that
some other offices anticipated shortages, but those offices lost staff persons and are therefore all right
through the end of the year.
Chair Sanders asked Ms. Price if her Characters 02, 03, and 04 will be all right through the end of the
year. Ms. Price answered in the affirmative.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the available fund balance is included in the ordinance. Chair Sanders
answered in the affirmative, and stated that the ordinance is simply formatted differently. Ms. Tribble
commented that the ordinance indicates that the Fund Balance is $2.9 million, but that is the projected
balance to December 31, 2008. She stated that the projected balance for 2007 is $6.4 million.

Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to forward Proposal No. 498, 2007 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
End of the Quarter Report on City and County budgets – presented by Robert Clifford, City
Controller
Mr. Clifford distributed a handout (attached as Exhibit B) and stated that OFM is working on
October’s update, but the September End of Quarter report is relevant. He said that Exhibit B is a
copy of the spreadsheets that were attached to the report he previously submitted to the Council in
October. He said that the most critical information is the 2007 revenues compared to the Budget
which indicates that the City was at 62% of its realized revenue at the end of September. Mr.
Clifford said that the major shortfall was due to property tax and tax increment financing (TIF),
which were significantly short due to the failure of the assessment process. He said that he recently
met with the Treasurer and Auditor and it is believed that almost 90% of the 2007 city and county
levy will be collected, which will result in the City being significantly short. Chair Sanders added
that historically, the City is more toward 95% to 98%. Mr. Clifford said that 90% is still a very
rough estimate, and that is high at this point. Councillor McWhirter asked if the 90% is through the
end of December or when everything is finally completed. Mr. Clifford answered that it is 85% to
90% through the end of December and approximately 95% to 98% when everything is completed.
He said that the 2008 Budget was put together at the 95% realization, as some shortfall was
anticipated. Chair Sanders asked what the completion represents. Mr. Clifford answered that
everything will be complete once the third reconciliation payment is received. He said that the Tax
Anticipation Warrants that are issued will be extended to the anticipated collection date in late
April, 2008 when the third reconciliation collection will be received. Mr. Clifford added that he
anticipates a significant shortfall in cash flows in 2008 as well, because as the Assessors finish their
2006 pay 2007 work, they will have to immediately complete their 2007 pay 2008 work. Therefore,
it is likely that it will be delayed and that tax bills will not be put out on time next year. He said that
there will be a proposal before the Council at the next meeting that will discuss the extension of the
Tax Anticipation Notes through 2008.
Councillor Nytes asked if there will have to be an additional appropriation for interest payments on
the Tax Anticipation Notes. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative, and stated that the cost of
interest will be the biggest cost. He said that there will also be an ordinance introduced at the next
Council meeting to pick up the additional interest that occurred in 2007 because of the delayed
cycles that were a result of the property tax issues. Mr. Clifford stated that he believes that these
types of problems will be present for approximately 12 to 18 months. Mr. Clifford said that the
City actually received more pension relief than anticipated and the courts are doing an excellent job
of collecting their fees and fines with their new collection agency. He added that County Option
Income Taxes are also being collected as anticipated.
Mr. Clifford said with respect to expenditures in the September quarter, he noted that about 68% of
the budget had been spent and another 11% has been reserved for payment of contracts that have
already been allowed. He said that he put a comment in the Financial Report was that he felt that
the budget looked robust and the City would under-spend the budget. He said that Mayor Peterson
asked for significant reductions in spending, and there are reserves in place that have not been

Administration and Finance Committee

released and the hiring freeze is still in effect. Mr. Clifford said that approximately 100 people have
been hired since September, of which 60 to 70 of them were police officers for the new recruit
class, 20 for Public Works to help keep the city clean and operational, and a few seasonal or parttime employees were hired for the Parks Department.
Mr. Clifford stated that he previously mentioned that Fleet Services will return to the Council for
another appropriation for fuel and it continues to be the bane of the Controller’s Office. He said
that this factor does positively affect the 2008 Budget or the remainder of the 2007 Budget. Mr.
Clifford said that the Police Department will also be coming before the Council for an additional
appropriation. Ms. Tribble said that a proposal was submitted for $7.1 million for the Police
Department, of which $2.5 million will be to cover the new police contract, $2 million will be to
cover overtime expenses, and the remainder is related to supplies and equipment for the new recruit
class. She stated that it is proposed that $2.5 million will come from the Sheriff’s budget, so part of
the appropriation is an adjustment of the amount that was left in the Sheriff’s budget when the two
departments were merged.
Chair Sanders asked if adding additional police officers through the recruit class has an immediate
impact on the amount of overtime or is overtime something that is rarely eliminated despite the
number of staff. Mr. Clifford said that overtime has been at a higher level for at least the last year
or two to combat some of the spikes in crime, and it was anticipated that it would not continue at
that level but there has been some mandatory overtime that Chief Spears could better explain. Chair
Sanders said that more information may be given at the Public Safety meeting. Mr. Clifford said
that the new police officers coming from the academy do not do their own shift duty for at least six
months. Therefore it takes approximately one year before those officers are on their own and
assigned to their own beat.
Councillor Nytes asked if the additional appropriation that is going to be introduced would have
been anticipated when there were talks about why the public safety income tax is needed. Mr.
Clifford answered in the affirmative, and stated that the Controller’s Office has been working with
Doug King, the Sheriff’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), on the budget. He said that it was not clear
how the administrative functions would be aligned or who was going to control them when the
budget was divided between the Sheriff and the Police Department. Originally one recruit class was
anticipated in 2007 and that the administrative functions would all go over to the Sheriff’s
Department, but the Sheriff did that incrementally. Mr. Clifford said that he is referring to
Information Technology, Finance, and Purchasing when referencing administrative functions.
He said that more expenses were left in the Police Department than anticipated due to those
functions being transferred incrementally, and therefore, some of the money is coming out of the
Sheriff’s Office’s budget. Mr. Clifford said that raises were not included in the 2007 Budget and
the second recruit class was not anticipated. He said that both recruit classes are relatively large
consisting of approximately 76 people, and there typically are about 35 to 50 people. Mr. Clifford
said that it was very difficult to break down the Sheriff’s Budget, as it had traditionally been
managed on a macro level and the City budget is managed on a micro level. He said that trying to
identify the specific charges between the Sheriff’s Office and the Police Department was difficult.
However, he said that he believes that the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department’s (IMPD)
budget will be in pretty good shape going into the 2008 budget.

Administration and Finance Committee
November 27, 2007

Mr. Clifford said with respect to the County, he believes that a significant amount of underspending for 2008 will occur and a $6 million fund balance is projected. He said that there are
some additional revenues from the Public Safety Answering Point, the Clerk’s Miscellaneous Fees,
and the Coroner have contributed $500,000 in revenues for charges to outside counties for
performing autopsies. He said that this was not included in the previous agreement with the
coroner. Mr. Clifford said that he does not suspect that his October report will have any
significantly different numbers. He said that he hopes to have that report available to the
Committee next week, and he believes that significant under-spending will occur throughout the
year. As part of the transition, he said that the Controller’s Office is being very restrictive on any
new contracts or hires at this point. Mr. Clifford said that there could be some Character 01
problems associated with turnovers in various departments, as there are some departments in which
people have served in their positions for many years. Chair Sanders asked if the problems with
turnovers would be due to accrued benefits. Mr. Clifford answered that prior to 1995, employees
who had accrued vacation and sick time could carry over that time. Then the Accrued Benefit leave
was initiated, and it stated that the maximum amount of accrued vacation or sick time that could be
carried over is 176 hours. Mr. Clifford said that there are a number of people that would have
significant payouts, such as police officers, firefighters, and some people in the administrative
offices. Chair Sanders asked where the Coroner’s revenue shows up in the budget. Mr. Clifford
answered that it appears in the County General Fund.
Councillor Nytes said that there was an earlier discussion with the Treasurer about how the rebate
would be handled, and that it would be costly if they had to mail out those rebates. She asked
where those expenses would be in the budget. Mr. Clifford said that the Treasurer recently
informed him that a bill was introduced in the Senate to allow Marion County to give that rebate as
a reduction in the third payment in 2007, and that all Democrats and Republicans in Marion County
and the Senate had sponsored that bill, so the Treasurer is hoping to get that authorized. Mr.
Clifford said that currently state law requires the Treasurer to do the rebate checks, which he
believes the estimated cost to mail those would be $1 million. He said that whether the checks will
have to be mailed or not may not be known until sometime in January.
Mr. Clifford distributed a copy of the Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) report (attached
as Exhibit C). He stated that for the last two years the City has been on a negative outlook because
of its imbalance in the revenues and expenses. Shortly after the budget was passed, he and Katie
Aeschliman from the Bond Bank traveled to Chicago and met with all three rating agencies. He
said that Moody’s and Fitch will likely not update the City’s rating anytime soon, but S&P affirmed
the City’s AAA rating, which is the highest potential rating for any city. Mr. Clifford said that there
are only five major cities in the United States that carry an AAA rating, and the City should be very
proud of this accomplishment. He said that S&P also removed the City’s negative outlook because
of a passed budget that contained balanced revenues and expenses. Mr. Clifford said that the
Controller’s Office is very proud, as the City inherited an AAA rating eight years ago, and it has
been a significant effort to manage and maintain the rating. He said that it is very important for the
City to continue with the AAA rating with respect to being able to perform major projects such as
the Convention Center expansion, the Circle City Mall, the Anthem development, the Emmis
development, or Tax Warrants.

Administration and Finance Committee
November 27, 2007
Page 7
Chair Sanders asked Mr. Clifford if he knows the identity of the other AAA rated cities. Mr.
Clifford answered that they are Dallas, Minneapolis, Charlotte, and Columbus. Chair Sanders said
that it would be interesting to see the combined tax rates that helped to determine their funding
sources and revenue for those cities. She said that maybe the Star can be convinced to do another
comparison. Mr. Clifford said that two of them are fast-growing southern cities, and Minneapolis
has always been known as a fairly high tax rate state. He said that he believes that Columbus is
very similar to Indianapolis in its competitive nature and how it goes about doing business.
Councillor Nytes said that it would be beneficial to attach this report to everyone’s minutes, as she
believes that it is really important that everyone has a chance to see this document.
Councillor Brown asked Mr. Clifford what the City’s AAA rating means to the citizens. Mr.
Clifford said that it means that the City’s financial situation, reserves, or fund balances are healthy
and that City is viable as far as going forward in doing business, and that the budget is balanced.
He said that a balanced budget means that the City has properly matched revenues and expenses,
has a low unemployment rate, has a good economic environment, and has a good overall outlook.
Councillor Brown said what it would mean if the City had an A rating or an AA rating. Mr.
Clifford answered that lower ratings would mean that the City has budgetary problems, would be
faced with cutting services out of city government, would have a lower employment rate, and the
opportunities in the City would not be as good. Chair Sanders asked if the City had previously
dropped from an AAA rating to an AA rating. Mr. Clifford answered that the City’s rating dropped
with Mooney’s and there was a threat the City’s rating would also drop with S&P, but S&P put the
City on negative outlook first. He said that they have now revised their outlook and given the City
an AAA rating. Mr. Clifford said that the report outlines some ongoing issues that the City is still
facing with respect to changes in the State Legislation, property taxes, circuit breaker, and other
matters such as these.
Councillor Bateman asked what the difference was between last year’s budget and this year’s
budget that allowed the City to receive the AAA rating. Mr. Clifford answered that last year’s
budget required the City to spend down approximately $70 million in fund balances and to borrow
money to get through the year. The 2008 budget paid back the debt from the previous year and
increased the fund balances. Mr. Clifford added that the City has fund balances because it allows
the City to pay bills timely and to perform necessary services. This year would have been a
catastrophe if the strong fund balances were not available. He said that not all of the fund balances
are flush, but because there are other fund balances, the city is able to do inter-fund loans during the
year to prop up the ones that do not have available balances. He said this year would have been
catastrophic, as the City went all the way to September before receiving any distributions on
property taxes. Mr. Clifford said that the city was also able to have inter-fund loans with the county
to sustain their budgets as well, so it is very important to maintain that going forward into 2008. As
the city becomes more reliant on income taxes, those fund balances are needed to sustain the
fluctuations that happen with income. He said that property taxes are a fixed amount that comes in
each year, with a 95% to 100% collected each year, but there are wild fluctuations with income
taxes.

Administration and Finance Committee

Councillor McWhirter asked if it is easier for the city to borrow money with lower interest rates
when the city has a higher rating. Mr. Clifford answered in the affirmative. Councillor McWhirter
stated that that information is good for the constituents to understand. Mr. Clifford said that the city
seldom borrows money, except for the Tax Warrants or County Option Income Tax (COIT) notes,
with the General Obligation that carries the AAA rating. He said that when a project is done such
as the Circle Centre Mall or the Anthem project, the TIF District supports itself. However, it is
important to have the backing of the city and the ability to put a moral obligation on one of the TIF
bonds provides a huge monetary advantage to the city.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and Finance
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:44 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Joanne Sanders, Chair

Information on the distribution of raises for the civilian employees of the City of Indianapolis –

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Administration and Finance Committee of the City-County Council met on Tuesday,
February 7, 2007. Chair Joanne Sanders called the meeting to order at 5:08 p.m. with the
following members present: Vernon Brown, Jackie Nytes, and Lincoln Plowman. Paul Bateman
arrived shortly thereafter. Absent were Becky Langsford and Lynn McWhirter.
PROPOSAL NO. 8, 2007 - reappoints Sheriff Frank Anderson to the Information Technology
Board
Sheriff Anderson said that he believes that with the consolidation, his department possibly has
the largest usage of Information Technology (IT) in the City and the County. He said that it is
important that the best service is available and that users are familiar with the processes, which is
why he feels that it is essential that he or his proxy are involved with the IT Board. He said that
he chose his proxy, Ron Meadows, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD),
because Mr. Meadows is very knowledgeable, has been trained, and has educational background
in IT.
Chair Sanders said that the ordinance states that, among other elected officials, the Sheriff is to
be one of the appointments to the IT Board. She stated that according to the attendance record,
the Sheriff has been represented at 12 out of 13 meetings. Sheriff Anderson said that he
apologizes for the missed attendance at the last meeting, as the absence was due to a
communication problem.
Councillor Brown asked Sheriff Anderson if Mr. Meadows is a sworn officer. Sheriff Anderson
answered that Mr. Meadows was a sworn officer, but is now a civilian employee.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to forward Proposal No. 8, 2007 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0. .
Mr. Meadows commented that he appreciates the Council’s support. He said that he
communicates with the Sheriff on a regular basis regarding the IT Board’s meetings, as he has
served as the proxy for the last five Sheriffs. He said that there is a lot to do, and he believes that
the IT Board is headed in the right direction for doing business differently than in the past.
Working with Northup Gruman has resulted in great strides; however, there are additional items
that can be done to improve services and reduce expenses.
PROPOSAL NO. 11, 2007 - reappoints Marion County Treasurer Michael Rodman to the
Information Technology Board
Mr. Rodman said that he has some IT background in his previous banking career, as the whole
banking industry depends on computers and software, as well as the many changes that are
included. He said though public service is different, the Treasurer’s Office cannot function
without good computers and software. He said that he has learned a lot from the other members
of the IT Board, and they have tried to set a goal of having the best IT service that can be
obtained. Mr. Rodman said that he is looking forward to a new property system this year after

Administration and Finance Committee
February 6, 2007
Page 3
JUSTIS is completed for the Public Safety area. He said that a new property system is needed to
help the Treasurer’s Office, as well as many other agencies, such as Public Safety.
Councillor Nytes said that she believes that the new property system is critical to the City’s
ability to make necessary adjustments and share information. She asked if Mr. Rodman can keep
a high level of communication with the Council as the new property system project progresses.
Mr. Rodman answered that the Treasurer’s Office would gladly keep the Council informed.
Chair Sanders said that the attendance records indicate that Mr. Rodman or his proxy, Chief
Deputy Treasurer Thomas Creasser, have attended over 90% of the meetings. She said that Mr.
Rodman has personally attended over two-thirds. Mr. Rodman stated that he was not aware of
any missed meetings. Shital Patel, Chief Financial Officer, Information Services Officer (ISA),
stated that Mr. Rodman was not appointed until after the second meeting.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to forward Proposal No. 11, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 15, 2007 - reappoints Councillor Marilyn Pfisterer to the City-County
Internal Audit Committee
Chair Sanders stated that Councillor Pfisterer is out of town, and consequently, cannot attend the
meeting.
Councillor Brown asked, since this is a reappointment, if the Committee could move forward
with this proposal. Chair Sanders answered that other reappointments have not been treated in
the same manner; therefore, she would prefer to maintain consistency and postpone the proposal
until the next meeting. Chair Sanders said that Councillor Pfisterer is at a training session in
another city.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 15, 2007
until February 20, 2007. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 57, 2007 - appoints Gregory H. Coleman to the Indianapolis Marion County
Building Authority Board of Trustees
Chair Sanders stated that Mr. Coleman is out of town and unable to attend the meeting.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 57, 2007
until February 20, 2007. The motion carried by a vote of 4-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 58, 2007 - appoints Robert Lutz to the Equal Opportunity Advisory Board
Chair Sanders said that Mr. Lutz is unable to attend the meeting due to the weather, as he was on
the other side of town.

[Clerk’s note: Councillor Bateman arrived at this time, 5:25 p.m.]
PROPOSAL NO. 59, 2007 - determines the need to lease approximately 50,000 square feet of
space at 151 North Delaware for use by the Marion County Public Defender Agency
David Cook, Marion County Public Defender, stated that Proposal No. 59, 2007 deals with the
need for the Marion County Public Defender’s Agency (MCPDA) to have additional space to
accommodate existing and new staff created by the Executive Committee’s note in 2006, as well
as budgeting for additional courts and other needs in 2007. Mr. Cook distributed a fact sheet
about the Public Defender’s Agency (attached as Exhibit A) that included the following
highlights:
•

Brief History
o MCPDA was created in 1994, and in 1995 there were approximately 30 FullTime employees

Chair Sanders asked Mr. Cook to explain the existence of the Office of the Public Defender prior
to 1994. Mr. Cook said that prior to 1993, Public Defenders were out-of-court services and were
appointments and employees of the individual judges of the Superior Courts. He said that there
wasn’t any type of support for things such as costs of litigation; the only thing that appeared in
court services were the salaries attributed to having Public Defenders. There were ethical
concerns with the Public Defender’s position as an employee of the Judge and there was no
organized approach to providing appropriate funding for the service. Chair Sanders asked if the
funding in the courts budget transferred with the inception of the Public Defender Agency. Mr.
Cook answered that he is unsure, as he was not the first Chief Public Defender. He said,
however, that particular funding only provided for part-time, contract lawyer salaries. Mr. Cook
said that when he took over the agency, the funding was approximately $3 to $4 million. Chair
Sanders stated that she was not suggesting that it was enough to make the transfer. She was
simply inquiring as to whether the funding became a portion of the budget.

Brief History (continued)
o 2007 Full-Time Equivilency is 218.87
o Over the last ten years movement toward having full-time representation, along
with a contingent of part-time lawyers providing indigent services, has been the
goal.
o Juvenile Division will remain at the 46th Street location
Present Locations Effected by Proposed Move
o City-County Building (CCB)
 5th Floor – 10,550 square feet (sq. ft.)
 11th Floor – 1,198 sq. ft.
 12th Floor – 6,278 sq. ft.
 Total
26, 786 sq. ft.

In 1995, MCPDA was originally alloted space to provide services
for indigent legal services on the 12th Floor
• Judge Payne also provided three or four offices at the Juvenile
Division in 1995
• In 2000, MCPDA expanded to the 5th Floor after the Prosecutor’s
Office moved to the Market Square Building
o 1219 East Market Street
 7th Floor – additional 4,380 sq. ft.
• Lease in effect until 2009
• Currently accomodates 25 or 28 individuals
Reasons for additional space
o Most attorneys do not have private offices
 Two-to-three attorneys in single office
 As many as four paralegals in one office space
o Executive Committee’s note created additional staff in 2006
o 2007 Budget approved additional staff in 2007
 Communications with City Controller, Bob Clifford, regarding the
possibility of additional space for 2007
o No room for additional staff – CCB unable to accommodate needs
o MCPDA volunteered to leave CCB if appropriate space found
 Mr. Clifford took on responsibility of finding additional space for
MCPDA
 Determined that MCPDA would be best suited by moving out of the CCB
to obtain additional space
 Mr. Clifford requested that Paul Smith, Real Estate Manager, Department
of Parks and Recreation, help find outside space in the downtown area for
MCPDA
o Space calculated to meet present needs – 50,000 sq. ft.
 Approximately 200 individuals will be involved in the move.
 Negotiations began with the Gold Building and the Disciples of Christ
building
 Mr. Smith was involved in the meetings with both groups and he
recommends the Gold Building as the most economical in meeting the
needs of MCPDA.

Chair Sanders asked if there will be a lease broken at the 129 East Market Street location. Mr.
Cook answered in the affirmative, and stated that the lease has a one-year escape clause. He said
that with approval, the move is not expected to take effect until possibly July or August;
therefore, the buy-out on the balance of that lease will be considerably lessened.
Chair Sanders asked if the move is approved, would it result in approximately 26,000 sq. ft. of
space becoming available in the CCB. She asked if there is a commitment to Building Authority
relative to the space and how it would be charged off in relation to the budget. Mr. Clifford
answered that the space will most likely be absorbed by the courts or court functions and a space
allocation committee will be reformed to determine how the space will be distributed between

Administration and Finance Committee

agencies. He said that he has toured the building with Mr. Smith and Ron Reinking, Building
Authority General Manager, and he has noticed that some of the agencies are overcrowded and a
number of floors have people with less than 100 sq. ft. per person, including hallways and
conference rooms. Mr. Clifford said that efficiencies are also being examined as to whether
some floors can be segregated for specific departments, which may cause some people to move
office locations. He said that minimal elevator usage could result in more convenience for
clients. Mr. Clifford said that Mr. Smith will look into all aspects, as he was previously the Real
Estate and Space Manager for the entire city until that position was eliminated.
Mr. Smith said that he has taken on this position, as he does not believe that there is not enough
work to employ a full-time person or a brokerage firm for this particular project. He said that he
appreciates the confidence that Mr. Clifford has shown in him. Chair Sanders said that the
Council appreciates that Mr. Smith is able to give a holistic view of how people are housed in the
CCB and the creation of more efficiencies can be beneficial to everyone.
Councillor Nytes said that she is pleased to hear that the Space Allocation Committee will be
reconstituted, as it was a good way to ensure communication between agencies and the Council.
Councillor Nytes asked Mr. Cook if the MCPDA also employs contract employees. Mr. Cook
answered in the affirmative. Councillor Nytes asked if office or conference space is provided for
those attorneys. Mr. Cook answered that, when the space was available, a basic office including
a desk, computer, and telephone, was made available to those contract attorneys when they
needed to perform public defender business in the building. Councillor Nytes asked if the move
would allow for that type of space to be made available again. Mr. Cook answered in the
affirmative.
Councillor Nytes asked if the tenant build-out will be included in the lease for the new MCPDA
arrangement. Mr. Smith answered in the affirmative. He said that is standard. The building
owner can issue what amounts to be a “street price” for the space in its current condition,
including their profit. A lessee asks for a build-out and will be amortized over a ten-year period
of time, as it is a ten-year lease. Mr. Cook said that he got an idea from Bingham McHale about
an interesting office concept of “Universal Office Space”, which is where everyone’s office
space is exactly the same, and is expecting to employ that concept in the Gold Building. He said
by using this concept, the space has been very efficiently laid out. Mr. Smith said that with
MCPDA’s agreement to move out, it provides an opportunity to reconstitute the group.
Councillor Nytes asked if anyone involved in the project from the city side has interest in the
building or property. Mr. Smith answered in the negative.
Councillor Sanders asked if the build-out and lease include all of the office furnishings. Mr.
Cook answered in the negative and stated that, with the approval of the Controller, necessary
office furniture has been bought from auctions at very minimal prices. The furniture was
previously stored at the old Central State, but has been moved with minimal damage.

Mr. Clifford said that this has been a long process because he wanted to ensure that a good
economic deal was being obtained. He said that the Gold Building is not the least expensive per
sq. ft., but was more efficient in many respects.
Councillor Brown asked approximately how much the lease will cost the City per year, as a lot of
office space is leased as opposed to purchasing land or buying a building. He said that last year
there was a proposal to purchase the Ludlow Building, which highlighted the benefits of buying
versus leasing, and he believes that the City should look into purchasing land to house all the
courts, the Prosecutor’s Office, and the Public Defender’s Office in one building rather than
continuing to lease property throughout downtown Indianapolis. Mr. Clifford said that it would
actually cost the City more to build than what the City will pay to lease per sq. ft. Mr. Smith said
that the lease for the Gold Building will cost the MCPDA $720,000 in the first year, which
includes the build-out.
Councillor Brown asked what the Prosecutor’s Office pays for their lease. Mr. Clifford said that
he believes that the Prosecutor’s Office pays $1.2 million per year.
Councillor Brown asked if the MCPDA lease will go up every year. Mr. Smith answered in the
affirmative, and stated that it will increase approximately 2.5% increase per year and it is
standard in most leases in the downtown area. Councillor Brown asked how much it will cost to
build a new government center. Mr. Clifford answered that it will be approximately $200
million to $300 million. Councillor Brown said that he would rather the City own the property
than rent it, as it would be a long-term aid to the City and the benefit of the taxpayers. Mr. Cook
said that one of the issues is immediate need and the system’s ability to respond and provide the
necessary space to perform services. Councillor Brown asked if ten years is the standard lease.
Mr. Smith answered that commercial leasing is typically never less than five years, and ten years
can be relatively short. He said that moving the MCPDA will allow the City to address other
interim needs for space within the building. Councillor Brown said that he understands the
immediate need.
Mr. Clifford said that there is office space that is unabsorbed that is over and above what the City
pays to occupy the CCB. He said that lease, including parking, averages to be approximately
$10 per sq. ft., whereas the lease for the Gold Building will average at approximately $16 per sq.
ft. Mr. Smith said that in comparing the numbers, it also must be recognized that there are
currently three people to a room, which does not reflect good working square footage.
Councillor Nytes said that the Councillors received a copy of a letter expressing that the Public
Defenders are at risk of losing a state reimbursement, and asked if it relates to this proposal to
relocate. Mr. Cook said that the letter is relevant to a case-load issue, but more people could not
be hired to address the case-load issue because there is no space to employ them. Councillor
Nytes asked if this problem is another example of the need to relocate, as it can result in the loss
of a significant state reimbursement. Mr. Cook answered in the affirmative, and stated that he
and Mr. Clifford are addressing the case-load issue. Councillor Nytes asked if Mr. Cook expects
the state to consider the approval of this lease as an action in good faith. Mr. Cook answered that

Administration and Finance Committee
February 6, 2007
Page 8
it is possible, but the State’s concern is case-loads per lawyer and due to the inability to provide
space for approved additional lawyers, MCPDA has not been able to address that concern.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Bateman, to forward Proposal No. 59, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 90, 2007 - approves the Installment Tax Payment Plan for certain real estate
taxes
Mr. Rodman distributed a copy of letter that he sent to units of government, along with a
timeline (attached as Exhibit B) and he informed the Committee that the Treasurer’s Office will
not be able to make a May 10 deadline for property taxes because only six of nine Township
Assessors have been able to turn in their assessed values to the County Assessor. He said that
five of the six appear to be in good form, and the sixth just arrived this morning so he does not
yet have feedback on it. He said that the remaining three have missed a deadline that was set
earlier this year. He said that the Treasurer’s Office cannot print the bills until the State has
approved and returned all the information. Mr. Rodman said, according to the timeline, if
everything was completed by February 5, which it was not, the bills would have been due June
22 or June 29. This is a significant delay from May 10, and will impact cash flow resulting in
units of government borrowing money and reducing the amount of interest that the City was
hoping to earn this year.
Chair Sanders asked if the City will also have to pay more interest on the current loans. Mr.
Rodman answered in the affirmative. Mr. Rodman said that he received e-mails from two
township assessors inquiring as to whether the Tax Management Associates (TMA) auditing
service on for the May collection. He said that he is waiting for direction from the Council and
legal counsel as to how TMA will be handled. Mr. Rodman said that TMA was hired by the
township assessors to help perform audits on personal property and inventory that was supposed
to deliver 75% of the tax dollar to taxpayers and the firm would receive 25%. This has not been
the case, the taxpayers are actually receiving 40% and the firm is receiving 60%. Chair Sanders
said that the contract was instituted in 2004 by previous assessors and the Council, as the fiscal
body of the County, was not given information about the contract until it was in effect. Mr.
Rodman said that legal counsel is inquiring as to how the contract can be broken or some type of
relief can be given.
Chair Sanders said that a representative from the Department of Local Government Finance
(DLGF) was expected to attend the meeting tonight, but he unfortunately was unable to attend.
She said that the Committee will work to have someone from DLGF appear before the
Committee to discuss the City’s position with regard to the assessors submitting their assessed
values to determine the county-wide impact. Chair Sanders said that she is regretful that there is
no means of consequence for the assessors’ withholding of necessary information, but there are
penalties for taxpayers who do not pay their taxes on time.
Mr. Creasser said that state statute provides the opportunity for the County Treasurer to request
consideration for an installment tax plan to be done annually. He said that this proposal is to

Administration and Finance Committee
February 6, 2007
Page 9
satisfy the annual request for approval to provide an installment tax payment program for
specified residents in Marion County. He distributed a handout (attached as Exhibit C) that
provides information on the participants of the 2005 pay 2006 Installment Tax Payment
Program. Mr. Creasser discussed the information including the following key points:
•
•
•
•
•
•

213 total participants with property taxes totaling $308,926.55
Program benefits taxpayers by allowing them to divide their payments into equal monthly
payments as opposed to twice annual payments
Program basically addresses limited and fixed incomes
Program must be done manually versus using the property system
Exhibit C lists four prerequisites for participation and a list of additional circumstances
that a taxpayer must meet at least one of to qualify for the program
The Treasurer’s Office can be notified at 327-4040 if interested

Councillor Sanders asked if there is a deadline by which taxpayers must apply. Cindy Land,
Administrative Deputy Treasurer, stated that taxpayers are required to file before the first
payment is due. She said that taxpayers are asked to pay an estimated amount until the actual
bill is available and then adjustments will be made. Chair Sanders asked if taxpayers do not
receive a statement prior to May 10, if they still need to submit the application prior to May 10.
Ms. Land answered that late applications will be accepted if the tax payments are current and the
program will be applied to the remaining balance of the amount due. Chair Sanders asked if the
taxpayers who have previously taken advantage of the program will be notified. Ms. Land
answered in the affirmative, and stated that letters go out to those individuals as signed contracts
and have to be updated every year.
Mr. Rodman said that there will be a number of taxpayers who are accustomed to receiving a tax
bill on May 10, but will not receive a bill this year by that time. He said that the Treasurer’s
Office will have press releases explaining why the bills are delayed. However, some people will
come in to pay their bill without the notice and the Treasurer’s Office will hopefully have the
information in the system as to the amount that needs to be paid before May 10. Mr. Rodman
said that he is hopeful that this same type of dilemma will not happen again next year.
Mr. Rodman said that there is also a Form 11, which shows the new assessed value, which
should have been sent out to the taxpayers last year, but did not get sent out. He said that
taxpayers need this information, as they have 30 days to appeal and file for tax abatements.
Councillor Nytes said that she questions if it is allowable, as there are laws and state regulations
determining when the notices are to be sent out. She said that she has many homeowners in her
district that have built homes in areas that the City was striving to re-populate, so there were
some abatement programs in some of those neighborhoods. Those individuals can find their
abatement in jeopardy or be caused great confusion. She asked if anything can be done to rectify
this problem. Mr. Rodman said that the Council has a right to ask for an explanation from the
assessors.
Councillor Nytes asked which townships have not submitted their trending reports. Mr. Creasser
answered that Washington Township’s report was not in the correct format, Center Township is

Administration and Finance Committee
February 6, 2007
Page 10
still working on a part of their report, and Warren Township has not submitted their report.
Councillor Nytes asked if the Council can obtain the proper language as it relates to requirement
on the distribution of the Form 11. Ms. Land answered that the Treasurer’s Office will look into
obtaining that information for the Council.
Chair Sanders said that the Committee is appreciative that the Installment Tax Payment Program
is made available to the taxpayers and she only regrets that taxpayers cannot be provided with all
necessary information in a timely manner.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to forward Proposal No. 90, 2007 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 5-0.
Information on the distribution of raises for the civilian employees of the City of Indianapolis –
Bob Clifford, City Controller
Chair Sanders said that in the 2007 budget, an allocation of certain monies was specified for all
agencies to provide civilian employees, as well as non-bargaining unit employees with their first
increase in a few years.
Mr. Clifford distributed the guidelines that were developed between the Department of
Administration, Human Resources, and the Office of Finance and Management in conjunction
with putting together the budget (attached as Exhibit D). He said that the guidelines were given
to all the city departments and county agencies to consider. He said that 3% increases were built
into the budget of all city and county agencies. Some exceptions to the guidelines included:
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Anyone hired after the announcement date, August 7, 2006, would not necessarily be
eligible provided the employee is paid within the paygrade defined by Human Resources.
Anyone who has received a promotion or equity pay increase after August 7, with the
understanding that those circumstances essentially put the employee in a position of
receiving a raise.
Exception to non-bargaining unit guideline; money was included in the budget to issue
raises for civilian employees of a new unit of the Indianapolis Police Department (IPD)
and the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD), ASCME, as they had gone three years
without a raise.
Employees must have been performing well. Essentially all city employees received 3%
raises.
Anyone who is already over the maximum pay for their paygrade, which mostly affected
the county side.
County Elected Officials did not receive raises, as those increases would have to go
through ordinance changes and be approved by the Council.
Probation Officers, Crime Lab, and Community Corrections did not receive raises,
because those persons are paid under a state mandated pay plan.

Chair Sanders asked if the AFSCME unit was a newly formed bargaining unit who had not
previously received any raises. Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager, Controller’s Office, answered

Administration and Finance Committee
February 6, 2007
Page 11
in the affirmative and stated that those employees would have fallen into the non-bargaining unit
employees. He stated that the AFSCME unit is only a portion of the civilian employees in IPD
and IFD.
Mr. Clifford said that County Officials were given deference to the decision making process;
therefore, those employees’ raises were dependant upon the elected official. He said that some
of the officials processed raises for their employees before leaving office and some did not.
Chair Sanders asked how early before January 1 were the leaving officials allowed to make the
adjustments. Mr. Seidenstein said that the newly elected officials have already turned in the
requests for raises, but some are still working on them. He said that assessments of the staff are
still being made to decide how to distribute the raises.
Mr. Clifford thanked the people in Payroll, the people that moved over from the Washington
Township Fire Department, and the people of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department
(IMPD) for processing and submitting all the changes by the end of the year.
Councillor Brown asked Mr. Clifford about raises for Correction Officers. Mr. Clifford said that
Correction Officers are a part of a bargaining unit, and therefore, did not receive raises.
Councillor Brown asked if anyone, not represented by a bargaining unit, received less than the
3% raise. Mr. Clifford answered that he is not aware of anyone in the City receiving less than
3%; however, county employees’ raises were based upon the decision of the County elected
official.
Councillor Plowman said that he has received correspondence from Correction Officers who
were concerned about not receiving the raise, because they are a part of a bargaining unit, but
were in the process of terminating their bargaining unit. The officers were concerned that they
would not receive the raise. He asked if the Correction Officers are now negotiating their
contract. Mr. Seidenstein said that he spoke with Allison Gritton, Corporation Counsel, who
explained that the Correction Officers have made a request to the Sheriff to have the Indiana
State FOP Council represent them. The Sheriff accepted the request in late January; therefore,
negotiations will begin soon.
Mr. Clifford introduced Hope Tribble, Budget Manager, Office of Finance and Management. He
said that she is currently assuming all the agencies that were previously handled by Kim Diller.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Administration and Finance
Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:30 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Joanne Sanders, Chair

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE
The Parks and Recreation Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday,
March 6, 2008. Chair Susie Day called the meeting to order at 5:00 p.m. with the
following members present: Ginny Cain, William Oliver, Mike Speedy, and Janice
McHenry. Monroe Gray, Jr. arrived shortly thereafter, and Vernon Brown was absent.
PROPOSAL NO. 62, 2008- appoints Matthew Klein to the Indianapolis Greenways
Development Committee
Mr. Klein said that he is an attorney for Bose, McKinney and Evans where he practices
Environmental Law. He said that he lives in Pike Township, a few feet away from the
Eagle Creek Trail. Mr. Klein has a wife named Terri, and two children. He said that he
is respectfully requesting to be appointed to the Indianapolis Greenways Development
Committee for many reasons. His chief reasons are his passion for the Greenways,
Economic Development opportunities, as well as recreational and health opportunities.
He currently serves as President of the Board of Directors for the Greenways
Foundation, a not- for- profit organization. They promote development, maintenance,
and enhancement of Greenways all across Indiana. Mr. Klein said that he has done his
best to help Karina Straub, Greenways Manager and others.
Councillor Speedy said that he has known Mr. Klein for 10 years from working on a lot of
different volunteer efforts, and that he understands his commitment for the community.
Councillor Speedy said that he thinks Mr. Klein will bring a good balance of
sophistication and training with a passion for something that is so valuable to the
community, such as Greenways. Councillor Speedy thanked him for his willingness to
serve.
Councillor McHenry said she has also had the privilege of knowing Mr. Klein for eight
years, and has worked with him on a lot of different activities. She said she has known
him to be a hard worker, and knows that he is very interested in Greenways, Parks and
the environment.
Councillor Oliver said that Mr. Klein’s credentials are quite impressive, and although he
has just known Mr. Klein for a moment, he has known the ladies and gentlemen of the
council for several months, and some for a couple of years. He said the Councillors think
highly of Mr. Klein, therefore he would vote for Mr. Klein’s confirmation.
Councillor McHenry moved, seconded by Councillor Oliver to forward Proposal No. 62,
2008 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote
of 5-0.
Joseph Wynns, Director of the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), said they
have been having a series of meetings on their comprehensive plan, and they are
pleasingly surprised at the amount of people that have been attending. He said 30-50
people are coming out to the meetings to discuss concerns they have for Parks. He said
they had a meeting in Councillor Cain’s district, Lawrence North, and it was fabulous to
hear how people were supportive and really interested in Parks. Mr. Wynns said they
attended the Mayor’s lunch for Parks at the Westin Hotel, where 500 people attended.
He said the Mayor spoke very highly of Parks value toward crime reduction and
neighborhood revitalization. Mr. Wynns said the meeting at Pike was cancelled due to

Parks and Recreation Committee
March 6, 2008
Page 3
the ice storm. He also said that once they get the information from people, they go
through it all and filter it, and they have a good time listening to people and their
concerns. He said they have a meeting planned for Center Township to talk about
Parks. People on the east side were concerned about maintenance as it relates to
Pleasant Run Parkway and Ellenberger Park, and people are telling them the good and
the bad. Mr. Wynns said that the Mayor is also watching the meetings, and expressed
the need to make sure the meeting is carried out in Pike. He said people are interested
in Indy Parks, and that is a good sign. There have been two Saturday meetings, one at
Krannert at 10:00 a.m., and Decatur Township at 1:00 p.m. They want to hear what they
are saying, and they incorporate all three pieces: meetings, citizens, and surveys.
Mr. Wynns thanked the Council for their support of Parks, and acknowledged that they
have some challenges ahead with property taxes and money issues, but that will not
stop them from being successful. He said if they do the right thing for the right reasons,
resources will come to help. Mr. Wynns asked a representative from Parks to explain the
process.
{Clerk’s Note: Councillor Gray arrived at 5:07 p.m.}
Don Colvin, Administrator of Resource Development announced that Thursday’s March
6th meeting would be held at the Glendale Branch Library, located at 6101 N. Keystone,
from 7-8:30 p.m. Mr. Colvin said the Parks and Recreation’s Open Space Plan updates
a five- year plan. He said this is required for both state and federal grants. The plan
collects the community’s vision of what they would like to see included in their park
system not only over the next five years, but some of the initiatives go beyond ten and
twenty years. Mr. Colvin said it is a wonderful way to gather the neighborhood’s input of
the big picture and of their township, as well as the county. He said it also allows them
to go to other funding agencies, and show them it is a well laid out, thought out plan. He
said because they value people’s time, Parks thought it was important to update the
2002 Greenways Master Plan. Therefore, they are doing two plans at the same time.
Mr. Colvin said connectivity is important to everyone, whether it is a park trail, health and
fitness, exercise or the larger Greenways network which they are building to connect to
schools, businesses, churches, government centers, and the community. He said a lot
of conversation is about Greenways and the future parks and recreation for Marion
County.
Mr. Wynns added that he is glad to see Mr. Klein coming on to the Greenways
Development committee, and that Mr. Klein is probably familiar with the plan. Mr.
Wynns said that there are some connectivity challenges for the trails that they have
already developed. He said some of them go to a certain point and stop, such as with
Pogues Run. He said some of the challenges put forth to the Greenways Development
Committee will be how to complete the trails. Mr. Wynns said a lot of the trails outside of
the Monon have not been completed. He said some serious challenges are represented
in the report by dotted lines. He also said that he has stressed to Mr. Colvin that when
they have their first meeting with the Greenways Development Committee, that he
should take the report and see where the different connections are. Mr. Wynns said in
addition to the Pennsy and the White River Greenway trail coming on, they already have
some existing trails which have challenges, and they are working to fix those challenges.
He called it a good plan, which is very active. The plan is good through 2012. Mr.
Wynns said they want to make sure that when someone is riding their bike on the trail,
they do not just come to a stop. He said people want connectivity, such as accessing

Parks and Recreation Committee
March 6, 2008
Page 4
the cultural trail, and downtown. Mr. Wynns said although Pogues Run goes all the way
to Brookside Park, they need to determine how to connect the Pogues Run Basin on 170 to Brookside and on to Spades downtown. The plan calls for them to determine
connectivity issues such as that. He said long- time Councillor Gray inquired about the
trail’s Trio system from 71st Street to Northwestway Park. Mr. Wynns said they have
challenges and it is something that they will layout with the Greenways Development
Committee. He said they are telling people they are not ignoring them, but they have to
make sure they complete the connectivity.
Mr. Colvin said that down on the Southside, there were no real plans, because there
were no existing abandoned railroad corridors or streams that were not developed. He
said he hopes that community discussion points out opportunities to look at some high
transmission line corridors. As developers continue to build, and road improvements
continue, there will be some additional bike lanes or improved sidewalks they can
connect through areas where they do not have a lot of public right-of-ways. Mr. Colvin
said they are trying to drill down another level with the Greenways Master Plan, to find
some of those things that were not in the conversation before. He said they have the
Metropolitan Plan Organization looking at bike and pedestrian connection and new
sidewalk ordinances. He said there are real opportunities that were not on the table in
2002, which is why they have made updates to this plan, as well as the comprehensive
Open Space Plan.
Councillor Oliver said that he is glad Mr. Klein was there to hear some of the matters at
hand. He asked Mr. Wynns what the progress is on East Washington Street and the old
National Trail. Mr. Wynns said they are still involved in land acquisition. He said they
have about a$ 2,000,000 grant from the State to acquire the land and do the design. Mr.
Wynns said they are just about complete in the process of laying out the trail. Mr. Colvin
said for them to acquire additional federal dollars they must have 100% of the trail
identified and laid out. There can be no questions about the route of the trail. He said
that it does not have to be in public ownership, but it has to be clearly a bonafide trail.
Mr. Wynns said they have one or two challenges which they are working out with a
couple of property owners, but once they resolve those, they are eligible to apply for
another $ 6,000,000 for the actual development. Councillor Oliver asked where the
connection is coming back towards town. Mr. Colvin said that it starts at Ellenberger
Park, runs south on Ritter, and lines itself with the Pennsey Trail. From there, it goes to
the town of Cumberland. He said the town of Cumberland is also developing their
segment of the Greenways Trail, and Mr. Klein has previously committed help from the
Greenways Foundation to further the initiative. Mr. Colvin said they welcomed that help
because they need strong voices to help in this particular project. He said there are
some commercial developers that have not been so willing to talk to Parks yet, and that
is where they need members of the Development Committee to help open
conversations. Mr. Colvin said as a public employee, he may not be able to enter
through those doorways.
Councillor Speedy asked when will Perry Township be rescheduled, how many meetings
they have had so far, and what townships they have been to. Mr. Colvin said that the
meeting for Perry Township has not been rescheduled for March 18, 2008. He said it
will be at the Southport Branch Library from 6:30 p.m.-7:30 p.m., located at 2630 E. Stop
11 Road. Mr. Colvin said they met with Wayne, Franklin, and Decatur Townships, and
Washington Township is scheduled for that night. Pike Township had to be rescheduled

Parks and Recreation Committee
March 6, 2008
Page 5
because of the ice storm. He said they also have meetings planned with Center
Township and the Mayor’s Advisory Council on Disability. He said they have some other
techniques to present the information to the group, and they are hoping the meeting will
help Parks understand the needs of the disabled, as well as provide success stories of
how they have used the Trail and Park systems.
Councillor Speedy said he appreciates the attention they have focused on Perry
Township within the last year or two, and how they are trying to find various park
amenities and looking at different options. He said he has had extensive conversations
with Duke Energy about power lines, and he hopes they had a better experience.
Councillor Speedy said that he remains optimistic, and again he appreciates their time,
and continuous work on the project. Mr. Wynns said that they cannot give many details,
but in Perry Township, they had a pretty good lead on another large piece of property.
Councillor Speedy asked if it is the one they have talked about. Mr. Wynns replied in the
affirmative. He said they are trying to work through some things, but Perry Township is
one of the dense areas. Also, in Washington Township, they are working on Wyandot
school and some property in that area. Mr. Wynns said they are also taking on the White
River School. They are gradually expanding and entering neighborhoods that need
attention, and he wishes they could have gotten the power line piece. He said it could
have made a big difference. Councillor Speedy replied that it would have helped a great
deal, but he remains optimistic, and they are persevering, which is how things get done.
Councillor McHenry asked Mr. Colvin to restate the time of the meeting for Pike
Township. Mr. Colvin said the meeting for Pike Township will be Tuesday, March 25,
2008 from 6:30-8 p.m. The meeting will be in the Westview Healthplex Sports Club
Conference Room, second floor, and the address is 3660 Guion Road.
Councillor Cain said she mentioned this information before, but wants to do it again.
She said there are 27 acres at 82nd and Sergeant, and the selling price is $1,000,000.
She said it would be awesome if she and the board members could help get access to
some of that, even if it was just a trail along the edge. Mr. Colvin said some of the trails
turn into a dotted line, which represents private properties, and that particular area is
Mudd Creek. He said for that exact reason development has not taken place there, but
if a developer or a gift came forth to the department, that dotted line would become a
solid line. Mr. Colvin said that is what they are hoping for in their vision, the community’s
vision, and in the future. Councillor Cain said it is a beautiful piece of property.
Mr. Wynns replied that it was a really nice piece. Mr. Colvin added that there are no
parks in that area. Councillor Cain offered her services if she help in any way.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Parks and
Recreation Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 5:19 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,

METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE
The Metropolitan Development Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday,
November 1, 2007. Chair Dane Mahern called the meeting to order at 6:40 p.m. with the following
members present: Ron Gibson, Lance Langsford, Robert Lutz, Jackie Nytes, and Marilyn Pfisterer.
Absent were Rozelle Boyd and Scott Keller.
PROPOSAL NO. 454, 2007 - transfers and appropriates $141,250 in the 2007 Budget of the
Department of Metropolitan Development (Federal Grants Fund and Transportation General Fund)
to pay for professional services and communications for a comprehensive public awareness
campaign about transportation alternatives, for a park and ride opportunity study, for purchase of
traffic counters and for relocation expenses for offices of the Metropolitan Planning Organization
Mike Peoni, Administrator for Division of Planning, said this proposal is shifting money out of one
Character into another; therefore, it is not increasing the budget. He said 80% of the dollars being
transferred are federal dollars that the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) receives and are
Metropolitan Planning grant funds. Mr. Peoni said 20% of the dollars being transfer are local
dollars and 60% percent of this 20% comes from Indianapolis and 40% comes from outlying
counties. He said the two activities that are being funded for the MPO are the move of MPO’s
office from the 18th Floor to the 13th Floor of the City-County Building (CCB) and increase their
staff size from eight to 15 employees by the year 2009. He said one of the reasons they have money
to transfer is because the positions that were supposed to be filled this year to meet the goal of 15
total employees has not occurred due to the city’s hiring freeze. Mr. Peoni said the reason for the
move is they are already packed tightly in their area and there is no space for MPO to increase the
number of staff. The cost of this move will be $40,000. He said $10,000 will be transferred to
Character 04 to allow MPO to purchase traffic counting equipment to allow more research to be
done in-house. Approximately, sixteen traffic counting machines will be purchased with the
$10,000 and they will begin to do some of the traffic counting in-house, although not all.
Councillor Nytes asked why they are moving in the direction of bringing traffic counting machines
in-house. Mr. Peoni said it will allow them to do more counts for the same amount of money and
they will have more control of getting the counts when they actually need them. Councillor Nytes
asked how they are freeing up money from the hiring freeze if they are purchasing other items. Jeff
Seidenstein, Budget Manager, Office of Finance and Management, said the money is federally funded
not property tax dollars. He said it is his understanding that the money being transferred is money that
has accumulated because they were authorized to fill positions early in the year, but they did not get
all of them filled.
Councillor Gibson asked if they were trying to save in the property tax area versus funds from federal
funding. Mr. Seidenstein said they were primarily focused on property taxes, because they are not
receiving the property tax revenue they anticipated. He said this is causing a cash flow situation that
they have to deal with because all their funds are pooled together. Mr. Seidenstein said the MPO has
a need for this money and it is federal money; therefore, they agreed to support this proposal.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if MPO will be self-funded within two years. Mr. Peoni said in the last few
years they have been trying to get other outlying counties to pay their share of the local match. He
said the local match that they are currently paying is less than years past.
Councillor Langsford asked which counties are paying their share of the local match. Michael
Dearing, MPO Manager, said for the 2007 work program for the MPO the following counties have

Metropolitan Development Committee
November 1, 2007
Page 3
contributed: $6,000 from the Town of Speedyway; $4,000 from Zionsville; $17,000 from Hamilton
County; $23,500 from Carmel; $24,000 from Fishers; $18,000 from Noblesville; $4,200 from
Westfield; $8,200 from Hancock; $523 from McCorrisville; $583 from New Palestine; $2,800 from
Avon; $15,000 from Johnson; $3,000 from New Whiteland; totaling approximately, $127,000
towards the local match. Councillor Langsford asked how that money is contributed. Mr. Dearing
said they send invoices to those organizations and they respond by sending a check from various
funds.
Ehern Bingaman, Executive Director for Central Indiana Regional Transportation Authority (CIRTA),
said when the CIRTA board developed the budget with the MPO for 2007 they anticipated they would
be hiring staff at the beginning of the year. He said this is the source to transfer the funds from
Character 01 to Character 03 for the extended professional services. Mr. Bingaman said for the 2007
budget the board did anticipate spending $50,000 on public relation services. At the October board
meeting the board decided not to lose the funds that would be available in Character 01 and to move
them instead to Character 03 and actually do public information studies that they really want to do.
Mr. Bingaman said the goal of the public information campaign is to build and improve awareness of
mass transportation and transportation alternatives. He said they are pursuing a base-line by
conducting surveys to understand at the beginning of their public information campaign what the
understanding awareness is of the issue and then again at the end assessing what the understanding is
of the issue. Mr. Bingaman said they would also like to do some focus group work to evaluate
reaction to different types of alternatives, technology, and their own brand identification for the
regional transportation authority.
Councillor Lutz asked if they are coordinating with IndyGo. Mr. Bingaman replied in the affirmative
and said they are still trying to establish as they grow if IndyGo will continue to just operate the bus
system or also manage a bus rail or a park-and-ride. He said currently they are working with MPO to
get the plans in place to figure out what the system looks like. Councillor Lutz said he is interested in
pursuing some type of rail from downtown to the airport.
Councillor Gibson said it is important that if we have an effective mass transportation system in the
Central Indiana region there must be a significant bus feeder system. He said there is a need for
IndyGo to grow and it should be a major player in the mass transportation system. Mr. Bingaman
said the board entirely embraces the necessity of an improved bus system and has a good relationship
with IndyGo.
Councillor Mansfield moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, to send Proposal No. 454, 2007 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 455, 2007 - transfers and appropriates $413,600 in the 2007 Budget of the
Department of Metropolitan Development (Consolidated County and Redevelopment General
Funds) to purchase uniforms for inspectors, code books, office supplies, and computer software
upgrades
Councillor Nytes offered a technical amendment to Proposal No. 455, 2007 and said there is a
reduction in the Redevelopment General Fund in order to fund this proposal. She said the $1,000
needs to be in Character 03 rather than Character 02 (Exhibit A, attached).

Metropolitan Development Committee

Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, to “Amend” Proposal No. 455, 2007 per
exhibit A. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
Rick Powers, Administrator for Division of Compliance, said $400,000 of the proposed amount is
related to the division going digital on all there work. He said everything will be implemented in a
digital environment to include the reviews of the plans that will expedite there processes. He said
the remaining amount will be used for uniform purchases for their union to better identify them in
the public and to purchase some office supplies.
Councillor Nytes moved, seconded by Councillor Gibson, to send Proposal No. 455, 2007 to the full
Council with a “Do Pass as Amended” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
Councillor Mahern asked for an update of the division’s move. Mr. Powers said everything is on
schedule and they are looking to move some time in December 2007.
PROPOSAL NO. 456, 2007 -approves the amounts, locations and programmatic operation of each
project to be funded from Community Development Grant Funds in 2008
Margaret L. Banning, Administrator for Community Economic Development, spoke on the
presentation of the 2008 Annual Action Plan (Exhibit B, attached). Some key points are as follows:
•

The Annual Action Plan is a part of the five year Consolidated Plan and they are mid-way
through the five year period (2005-2009). The Consolidated Plan identifies the spending
goals and priorities for their federal entitlement funds and serves as the application to
Housing Urban Development (HUD).

•

The Annual Action Plan lays out the annual bench marks that they need to achieve in order
to accomplish those five year goals.

•

The four funding sources for their entitlement funds from HUD are: Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG), Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) and
American Dream Downpayment Initiative, Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), and Housing
Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). They have anticipated the amount of each
funding to be the same as last year.

•

The top related housing issues that were identified through surveys were the concerns of the
housing stock in neighborhoods and addressing homelessness; top non-housing issue was
crime awareness; and the top homelessness related issue is life skills training.

•

If all the requests were to be funded it would total $17.6 million; however, there is only
$11.2 million to be distributed.

•

They will be focusing more with affordable housing in the area of: rehabilitate substandard
units to create homeownership opportunities and constructing new homes for persons at or
below 80% of the medium-family income (MFI).

Metropolitan Development Committee
November 1, 2007
Page 5
•

Four more goals have been added to prevent homelessness for the special needs population
that is more specific to the HOPWA funds.

•

More specific goals have been created to decrease the number of homeless, which is part of
the blue print to end homelessness.

•

The new job creation is through the Keystone Enterprise Park and other economic
initiatives that are in distress areas.

•

Combining housing opportunities with social and public service - the goal is to have 50% of
fund services be tied to permanent housing and 30% of housing dollars to go towards sites
that are within 10-minute walk of a bus route. Currently all their housing complies with the
10-minute walk of a bus route.

Councillor Langsford asked what the MFI is. Jennifer Fults, Assistant Administrator for Community
Economic Development, said the MFI for a family of four is $62,500 and they are trying to assist
families that are 80% below this income. She said the income range changes with household size.
Councillor Nytes asked if they project any roll-over money from federal grants so they could
address some issues that were put on hold. Ms. Banning replied in the affirmative and said that
would be addressed through the federal grant review process during that year when funds become
available. Councillor Nytes asked what the timing of development for the next large plan would be.
Ms. Fults said they will most likely start on the new plan at the end of 2008 and have something out
to the public in mid-October 2009. Councillor Nytes asked if they can use some of these funds on
some type of neighborhood economic development. Ms. Banning said that there are grants
available to target economic development; however, using CDBG funds for private business can be
difficult, but if the community agrees this is an area they want to focus on they can try to
accommodate.
Councllor Lutz asked if some of this money can be used for convict re-entry programs. Ms.
Banning replied in the affirmative and said some money is currently being used for job training
programs.
Councillor Gibson moved, seconded by Councillor Pfisterer, to send Proposal No. 456, 2007 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
Ms. Banning went on to give an update on minority business enterprise (MBE) and women business
enterprise (WBE) participation (Exhibit C, attached). She said to date this year, of the construction
grants they have funded, 28% went to MBEs and 10% went to WBEs. She said they anticipate
these numbers increasing when they have their year-end as these are only third quarter numbers.
Update on the Comprehensive Plan and map presentation
Keith Holdsworth, Department of Metropolitan Development (DMD), Principal Planner, said the
Comprehensive Planning section has been working on updating the Comprehensive Plan since
September 2000 and the plan is now completed. He said the Comprehensive Plan is a requirement
for any jurisdiction in Indiana that would like to do zoning. The plan is available to form a stable

C

basis for plans. Mr. Holdsworth said the plan is not zone; however, it the Metropolitan
Development Commission must pay attention in their zoning decisions. Mr. Holdsworth described
what each color on the maps represent and said the brightly colored areas are the recommended land
uses, which consist of 19 categories. The light brown areas on the map have sub-area plains (i.e
neighborhood, corridor, or regional center plan) and they did not duplicate that planning effort. The
green areas on the map represent environmentally sensitive areas, which include flood plans,
wooded areas, steep slopes, wellfields, and wet lands. He said development can still happen in
these areas; however, these environmental factors need to be taken into account. Mr. Holdsworth
said they also identified critical areas where they stated why they are critical and what the
recommendations are for these particular sites.
Councillor Lansford asked what process they use to educate the Metropolitan Development
Commission on the Comprehensive Plan. Mr. Holdsworth said they have retreats twice a year and
the Comprehensive Plan makes up a significant portion of their retreat. He said he also keeps them
up to date with the plan outside the retreat.
Councillor Nytes asked if the wellfield education is done by special funding. Mr. Holdsworth said
the Marion County Wellfield Education Corporation was set up by the City-Council in the late
1980s, and they receive funding from the three water companies in Marion County every year to
conduct wellfield education programs. He said the education programs are mostly geared towards
businesses. Councillor Nytes expressed her concern of additional education for the public on
wellfields.
Councillor Pfisterer asked if maps are available to the public. Mr. Holdsworth replied in the
affirmative and said they are available via their website or the Division of Planning’s office.
Councillor Mansfield asked if they are aware of groups actively out getting property for parks. Mr.
Holdsworth said the Park’s Department could better answer that question.
Councillor Nytes asked if they plan to update some of the sub-area plans. Mr. Holdsworth said
staff will be working on three corridor plans; South Keystone Ave, Shelby Street, and they are
currently working on Kentucky Avenue. Mr. Peoni said they do two neighborhood plans a year
depending on resources. He said although the plans seem like they are old the recommendations
still remain the same. Councillor Nytes asked how many neighborhood plans the department should
be doing. Mr. Peoni said it would be great if they could do four a year.
Councillor Mansfield asked if something is being done to address commercial encroachment. Mr.
Holdsworth said commercial encroachment is an issue they heard a lot about while developing the
plan, and many of the critical areas address this concern. He said they tried to be very sensitive
towards commercial encroachment.

Patrick Carroll, Deputy Director of MaintenanceServices,Departmentof Public Works (DPW), said that the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department(IMPD) fleet presentlyhas a little over 2,000 vehicles, which
includes approximately 500 Crown Victorias that have over 100,000miles. The criteria for replacementis
either eight years of service, 50% of the purchasecost is devotedto maintenance,or the vehicle mileage is
between80,000 to 100,000miles or more. Mr. Carrroll said that the purchaseof 66 police cars will replace
approximately10%to 15%of the currentvehiclesthat haveover 100,000miles.
Councillor Cain asked if the money that is being requestedto make the purchasescomesfrom TIF Revenue
Bond proceedsthat are extra or if it is being takenfrom funds that needto go back into the TIF fund to be used
for anotherpurpose. BarbaraLawrence,IndianapolisBond Bank, saidthat this requestis from a combinationof
two separatefunds. One fund is money that has accumulatedthrough interestearningsand excessrevenues.
She said that the other fund is revenuesthat are available. She said that the funds are able to be usedfor any
purposethat benefitsthe TIF district. Councillor Cain askedif there is a rule that prohibits extra TIF funds of
one district from being usedto help payoff a TIF in anotherdistrict. Ms. Lawrenceansweredthat it has been
typical practiceto userevenuesthat are availablein excessof debt servicefor capital projectsin, adjacentto, or
benefitingthat TIF district. Shesaid that if there is a processwhereTIF revenuesare rolled over, it would be a
separateprocessthat hasto go throughthe Council for additionalconsideration.
Councillor Keller askedif the approvalof the proposalwill increaseproperty taxesor ratesfor property taxe~.
Ms. Lawrenceansweredin the negative. Councillor Keller askedif this would be the first time that money'-i:s
usedfor capital improvementsto help the TIF district. Ms. Lawrenceansweredthat TIF revenueshave been
used for items such as sanitary sewer projects and stormwaterprojects through the annual budget process.
Councillor Keller statedthat he wantsto be addedasa sponsorfor the proposal.
Councillor Speedyaskedwhere the TIF district is located. Ms. Lawrencesaid that the proposalis for two TIF
districts: one is the 86thStreetTIF that is generallyin Pike Townshipand the other is the ConsolidatedTIF that
is in the downtown area. Councillor Speedyaskedwhat the expectedlife is of a police car. JamesReno,
Deputy Chief of Administration Division, IMPD, answeredthat the police cars are being kept longer than
desiredand being driven longer due to bettermanufacturing,but the criteria suggeststhat carsbe replacedafter
eight years. Chief Reno said that the 500 vehiclesthat havebeenreferencedare 1996s,1997s,and 1998s. He
said that the departmentwould ideally like to replacethe vehiclesbetweenfive and eight years,dependingon
the mileage,becauseof the intenseusageby police officers.
Councillor Speedyaskedif this is the first time that llF revenueshave beenusedfor goodssuchas purchasing
police vehicles. BarbaraLawrenceansweredthat the City has utilized llF revenuesthrough the annualbudget
processto purchaseapparatus,generally for fIre stationsand fire apparatus. Councillor Speedyasked if th~
Council receiveda memoaboutthe request. Ms. Lawrenceansweredin the negative.

Councillor Abduallah statedthat 51 of the vehiclesare to be usedin Pike Township and askedif that is due to
the TIF being developedin that area. Bob Clifford, City Controller, answeredthat the vehicleswere identified
when it was determinedthat the funds could be used to replace automobiles. The greatestneed was for
replacementof police vehicles. Mr. Clifford saidthat Chief Renowas askedto identify the patrol vehicleswith
more than 100,000miles that were assignedto officers in the northwestdistrict and in the downtown district
with regardto the amountof moneythat was availablefor usein eachdistrict.
Councillor Abduallah asked what other neighborhoodsand communities would have to do to obtain
improvementsto patrol vehicles in their neighborhoodpolice stations to ensure safer neighborhoods. Mf.
Clifford answeredthat the City is working on updatingall police vehiclesas part of the 2008 budget;howeve~,
due to property reassessments,
the City is short approximately$40 million to $50 million of working capital for
the 2007 budget. He saidthat this proposalinvolvesmoneythat can only be usedto benefitthe TIF district, and
therefore,the goal is to resolve as many of the issuesin thesedistricts as possible. Mr. Clifford said that the
Controller's Office plansto add a significant numberof vehiclesin the 2008 budgetand is working on trying to
catchIMPD up for 2007. Councillor Abduallahaskedif other vehicleswill be purchasedin the future through
Fleet Management.Mr. Clifford answeredthat it is the intent for Fleet Managementto be the owner of all the
vehicles,including Public Works, County agencies,and Metropolitan Development,in the future. He said that
this would make it easierfor control of the vehicles,replacementof the vehicles,and assignmentof the vehicles
underCity-County policies.
Councillor Moriarty Adams askedif it is legal to usethe money from the TIF district for the patrol vehiclclS.
Ms. Lawrenceansweredin the affirmative and statedthat Bond Counselhas beenconsultedon the issue. She
said that it is a practicethat hasoccurredin other cities. Councillor Moriarty Adams askedin what other ways
the money could be used. Ms. Lawrenceansweredthat the moneycould also be usedfor bricks and mortar or
anythingthat would fall under large capital expenditures,suchas sanitarysewers,stormwater,sidewalks,street
repairs,or streetlights.

PROPOSALNO. 313. 2007 - amendsthe Code for the purposeof adding unlawful storageor parking of
inoperable vehicles to the provisions relating to environmental public nuisances and administrative

adjudication
of environmental
violations

'i:

Kevin Sifferlen, Mayor's Office, Neighborhood Services,said that Section 575 of the Code is the public
ordinancethat allows for notice of violation and prosecutionof peoplethat are in violation of high weeds,grass,
trash,and debris on properties. Mr. Sifferlen saidthat in the pastyear, the law hasbeeninternally utilized with
the weed program,which is through a coordinationof NeighborhoodServicesworking with DPW, and haslead
to the abatementof high weeds and grass. He said that approximately 1,000 calls per week are nomtally
receivedduring this time of year, but this year the calls are down to lessthan 200 calls per week. Mr. Sifferlen
said that considerationis being taken on administrativelyadjudicatingthe casesto go after bad actors and
landlordsthat do not keep their propertiesclean. He said that a holistic approachwas examinedto determine
how quality of life issueswere being administeredthroughoutthe Inspection/Compliance
processand the City
Legal prosecutionprocess. Mr. Sifferlen said that inoperablevehiclestake a great deal of the caseload in the
City Attorney's Office and it is believedthat addingthe words "inoperablevehicles"to Section575 will allow
the City to administrativelyadjudicatethosecases.He saidthat there is an AdministrativeAttorney on contract
with the City that is willing to help with this process,which will take away the backlogof inoperablevehicles.
Mr. Sifferlen said that inoperablevehicle casestypically addressinstancesin which a person has vehicles,
usually more than one, with expired license plates locatedon their property. He said that if this languageis
addedto the Code, it will allow the StateProsecutorsto work on other seriousissues,suchas zoning violatio~
and animalbites.
.,:
..

Rick Powers,Administrator, Division of Compliance,Departmentof Metropolitan Development(DMD), said
that this ordinance will not changehow the Division of Compliance addressesabandonedvehicles, as the
current system of removing them is effective. Mr. Powers reiteratedthat an abandonedvehicle is not an
inoperablevehicle, as an inoperablevehicle would most likely be subjectto a traffic violation. He said that
becauseof the differentiation, the only way to adjudicateis through the courts,and DMD is not allowed to go
onto private propertyto removean inoperablevehicle. They are, however,allowed to go onto private property
to removean abandonedvehicle. Mr. Powerssaidthat inoperablevehiclesrepresentapproximately50% of the
Division of Compliance'scaseload,and to movethosecasesinto the AdministrativeLaw Judge(AU) scenario
will allow for a quicker processof hearingthe caseand administeringthe necessaryfmes and penalties. It will"
also help alleviatesomeof the burdenon the courts.
'
Councillor Speedyaskedif peoplewho receivean inoperablevehicle violation will still havethe right to appeal
an AU decision. Mr. Powersansweredin the afftrrnative. Councillor Speedyaskedif the decisionof the AU
will be prejudicial againsta personthat appealsto a superioror circuit courtjudge. Mr. Powerssaid that he is
not qualified to answer that question, but he believes that everyone is allowed to speak in court without
prejudice.
.:
Councillor Abduallah askedif thereis any recoursefor peoplewithin neighborhoodsthat havevehiclesthat they
plan to restorebut do not have the resourcesto do so at the time, but have a desireto keep the vehicle. Mr.
Powers answeredthat one option is to remove the vehicle from public view becausemost of the nuisance
complaints are from people who view the item as unpleasantor unappealing. He said that most often the
complaints are regarding vehicles that have other nuisanceissuesthat add to the problem, such as housing
vennin, high weeds and grassgrowing around them. Mr. Powerssaid that if the vehicle is a newer vehicle,
Compliancewould suggestthat the personplatethe vehicle.
Chair Conley askedif the nuisanceis on public streetsor on private property. Mr. Powersansweredthat it can
be enforcedin either case,but the violation would be on private property in the caseof a public nuisance. Hf
said that most casesare due to expired licenseplates,and if peoplewould plate the vehicles,there would be no
problem from neighbors or compliance. Chair Conley stated that plating a vehicle also requires having

Membersof the Public Works Committee

insuranceon the vehicle. Mr. Powerssaid that Chair Conley is correct and statedthat the fmancial hardshipof
insuring and plating the vehicle may be part of the issue,but the other issue is that the public has a right to
expectthat the nuisancenot exist. He said that Compliancereceivescalls to alleviate theseproblems,and they
are simply trying to addressthe problemsin a way to put fewer burdenson the courts.
Councillor Keller commentedthat the calls that he receivesfrom the constituentsin his area are regarding
vehiclesthat have other nuisanceissues,as Mr. Powerssuggested.He doesnot receivecomplaintson people
who havemany vehiclesthat are parked,but plated. He saidthat he sharesCouncillor Abduallah's concern,but
he believesthat this streamliningwill not have much of a negativeeffect on thosepeople looking to restorea
vehicle,as opposedto thosewhojust havevehiclessitting with no purpose.
;.:
Councillor Vaughn askedif the wording of the ordinanceoutlinesan exceptionfor someonewho is restoringan
automobile. Mr. Powersansweredin the negative,and statedthat if the restorationis taking placein a garageor
enclosedarea,that is fme. However,if the restorationis taking place in someone'syard, it is in violation of the
zoning issueof auto repair and becomesan issueof restoringa vehicle in a residentialarea. Councillor Vaughn
statedthat this is a distinct ordinancefrom a zoning issue,as a personcould not commit a zoning violation but
still be in violation of a public nuisance. Mr. Powersstatedthat Councillor Vaughn is correct. Councillor
Vaughn said that he believesthat the intentionsare good and would have a significant impact if the ordinance
was carefully drafted, but his caution is that the ordinanceis not measuredby what it is intendedto do, but &y
what the law statesthat it has the power to do. He said that if there is nothing in the ordinancethat exempts
someonewho is restoring a vehicle, regardlessof where the vehicle is kept, that personcan still be found in
violation of the ordinance. Councillor Vaughnstatedthat Councillorshavea duty to protecteveryone'sinterest
and askedMr. Powersif he feels that a personrestoringa vehicle would be exemptedunderthe ordinance. Mr.
Powersansweredin the negative,and statedthat the exemptionwould dependon wherethe restorationis taking
place, becauseit is not the intent of Complianceto go into a person'sgarageto removea vehicle. Councillor
Vaughncommentedthat though it is not the intent, it would be consideredpossibleunderthe law. Mr. Powers
statedthat Zoning Inspectorsdetermineif a violation is in view of the public as a part of enforcingthe violatio~.
Councillor Vaughn said that his concernis that if a vehicle is taken from a person'sgarage,that personwould
not have an argumentin court, becausethe ordinancedoesnot statethat the vehicle cannotbe taken from their
garage.
Councillor Speedyasked if the ordinanceis being heardby the Public Works Committeebecauseit involves
environmentalservices. Mr. Powersansweredin the affirmative. Councillor Speedyaskedif this streamlining
will savethe taxpayersmoney,haveno financial effect, or cost more money. Mr. Powersansweredthat there i's
no cost to the taxpayer,becauseInspectors,AUs, and prosecutorsare all paid by fees, so the cost is paid f>y
violators. Mr. Sifferlen addedthat an analysiswas doneover the winter that examinedweeds,as administered
through Section575, and the potential of adding inoperablevehiclesto the section. The examinationincluded
looking at how much it cost the City when calls were receivedabout weeds,and it was determinedthat the
administrativefee neededto be increasedfrom $124 to $226. This fee doesnot include any other fees incurred
by DPW or vendorfees,so it would potentially cost $300or moreeachtime the City hasto cut someone'sgrass
or weeds.Mr. Sifferlen said that the money is receivedwith a great deal of compliance,becauseeven if the
persondoes not pay the fine, it goes onto the property tax liens, which in turn goes back into the fund and
regeneratesitself. Mr. Powersaddedthat currently there is a voluntary compliancerate of over 80%, and this
changewill only affect the lessthan 20% that representthe exceptionand do not want to cooperate.He saidthat
mostof the time a notification is given, the constituentcomplies,requiring no further action.
Councillor Mahem askedwhy so much of the languageis removedin Section575-7. Mr. Sifferlen answered
that the original fees were determinedat the time that the law was originally passedin 1995. In addition to
updatingthe administrativefees,the associatedfeeshave beenremovedbecausemany of them were outdated.
Subsection(I)c of section575-7 addresses
thosefeeswith the wording "any other reasonablefee." Mr. Powers
addedthat the changesalso reflect that contractorsnow perform the tasks. When the law was made,the fee;s

Membersof the Public Works Committee
July 31, 2007
Page6
were for equipmentchargesthat DPW employed. Councillor Mahem askedif researchand analysishas been
doneto supportthe changesin fees. Mr. Sifferelenansweredin the affmnative. Councillor Mahem commented
that it is importantthat feesare sufficient enoughto cover the actual costsso that the programis self-sufficient
and effective.
Councillor Keller said that since inoperableand abandonedvehicles joined the big high grass and wee<:is
problem in his district, his constituentsconstantlyask that it be streamlinedand correctedmore quickly and
efficiently. He said that he is pleasedthat the City hasbeenlisteningto the neighborhoodsand the peoplewho
havethe problemwith othersbeingnon-compliant.
Councillor Abduallah askedhow the penaltiesare set. Mr. Powersansweredthat penaltiesare establishedby
Indiana Code and the Legislaturedetenninesthe maximumpenalty for violations. Councillor Abduallah asked
if the $2,500penalty is believedto be a reasonablechargein this particularviolation. Mr. Powerssaid that it is
the amountthat was setby Legislatureasthe maximumfor thesetypesof violations.
Councillor Cain askedMr. Sifferlen for a numberto call with complaints. Mr. Sifferlen answeredthat the best
person to call is the neighborhoodliaison for the district in which the constituent lives, but everyone is
encouragedto call the Mayor's Action Centerto makea complaint.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, secondedby Councillor Keller, to forward ProposalNo. 313, 2007 to the
full Council with a "Do Pass"recommendation.The motion carriedby a vote of7-1, with Councillor Abduallah
castingthe negativevote.
PROPOSALNO. 314. 2007 - establishesa 20-mile-per-hourspeedlimit in the HartmanVillage (District 18)
Councillor Brown said that he would like to requestthat the speedlimit in Section of ProposalNo. 314, 2007
be changedfrom 20 miles per hour (mph) to 2S mph to comply with statelaw.
Councillor Cain moved, seconded by Councillor Moriarty Adams, to amend Proposal No. 314,2007 to change
the speed limit from 20 mph to 25 mph. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Councillor Brown said that this proposal deals with a residential neighborhood with approximately 160 houses
in a four-block area. He said that the change will primarily impact the people that live in the area and their
guests. Changing the speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph may help slow cars down and protect the children in
the neighborhood. Councillor Brown said that an engineering study would have to be done to go from 30 mph
to 20 mph to comply with State Statute, which would cost a lot of money, and he believes that his constituents
will be happy with even the small change.
Councillor Vaughn asked what the procedure is to change speed limit signs. Nathan Sheets, Senior Project
Manager, DPW, said that residential areas do not typically have 30 mph speed limit signs, so the change would
just require DPW to go in and put up 25 mph signs.
Councillor Speedy asked what the staff's opinion is on the speed limit change. Mr. Sheets answered that it is
DPW Engineering's opinion that reducing the speed limit to 25 mph will not slow people down and that it will
cause a burden toward enforcement, but he understands Councillor Brown's concerns with speeding vehicles.
He said that, however, there is not a problem in reducing the speed limit in a neighborhood such as this one
because it is not a major traffic issue. Councillor Speedy said that he often supports the staff because of their
objective viewpoint and their underlying policies for safety, but be believes that there is a big distinctio~
between 20 mph, 25 mph and 30 mph. He said that he feels that 25 mph streets can be managed, and is a good
limit for children to grow up in. He understands that 20 mph speed limits require a Study because it 1$
considered an extraordinary circumstance and has been found to be unsafe.

Councillor Mahem asked if there has been a study on the impact that vehicles have on a street basedupon
whether those vehicles travel at 25 mph or 30 mph. Mr. Sheetsansweredin the negativeand statedthat he
would not anticipateany maintenance-type
issueswith the changein speedlimits.
Councillor Moriarty Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Mahern, to forward Proposal No. 314, 2007 to the
full Council with a "Do Passas Amended" recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.

Councillor Conley said that Ms. Carr has served long and well and he would support accepting the
reappointment. Councillor Abduallah said that he would also support the acceptance. Councillor
Randolph said that he is not familiar with Ms. Carr and his only reluctance is to set precedence that
by proxy the only thing that is required to be reappointed is that one is a good person; no one would
come to the meetings to be reappointed. Chair Nytes said that the good thing about waiting to
reappoint until the person can attend the meeting is that they are able to give an update on the
activities of the organization and it also offers a forum for the appointees in which to speak.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to “Postpone” Proposal No. 166, 2006
until May 3, 2006. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 167, 2006 - reappoints William C. Oliver to the Urban Enterprise Association
Board of Directors
Chair Nytes said that there is already precedent among Council committees to reappoint sitting
Council member in their absence. She said that Councillor Oliver has been involved in several
meetings with the City and Economic Development staff about the challenges that the Urban
Enterprise Association (UEA) is facing.
Councillor Abduallah moved, seconded by Councillor Sanders, to forward Proposal No. 167, 2006
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
Councillor Cain asked Chair Nytes to explain what the UEA is. Chair Nytes said that the UEA is
responsible for the management of the Urban Enterprise Zone, which is an area that had
significantly challenged conditions in which the average income was extremely low, the
unemployment rate was extremely high, and the amount of vacant commercial space was high.
This area surrounds Keystone Avenue, slightly to the south and north of I-70 and to the east and
west toward Martindale/Brightwood and the Monon.
PROPOSAL NO. 100, 2006 – imposes a county economic development income tax on the
adjusted gross income of county taxpayers

Economic Development Committee
April 12, 2006
Page 5

Chair Nytes said that the Legislature extended the use of the County Economic Development
Income Tax (CEDIT) to allow county governments to provide a Homestead Credit to compensate
for any possible increases in property tax because of the Inventory Tax rolling off. She said that
testimony has been taken from a variety of people, research has been conducted by Council
financial staff, and information has been gathered from the Treasurer’s Office and County
Assessor’s Office, and it has been concluded that this is not a fair, proper solution to offsetting the
end of the Inventory Tax. Chair Nytes recommended that the Committee “strike” this proposal.
Councillor Sanders said that she agrees with Chair Nytes’ assessment and believes that this would
have been a very short-term solution and, unfortunately, would have only made a dent in some of
the challenges that the City is facing.
Councillor Conley asked if there is a chance for the issue to be revisited if the proposal is stricken.
Chair Nytes said that the Committee would not have the opportunity to revisit the issue this year
because the deadline for acting on it will expire June 1st. She said that the Legislature will be
revisiting the property tax package next session and may offer another tool to be examined next
year.
Councillor Pfisterer said that she is concerned for Wayne Township with the rolling off of the
Inventory Tax as there is a lot of industry in the area that will be significantly hit; therefore, she
agrees that trying to find another avenue for the income or revenue would be appropriate.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Conley, to “Strike” Proposal No. 100, 2006.
The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 165, 2006 - an inducement resolution for Camby Woods, L.P. in an amount not
to exceed $14,000,000 which consists of the construction of a 220-unit apartment complex to be
known as Camby Woods Apartments located at 7700 Camby Road (District 22)
Chair Nytes said that this proposal was passed at the last Committee meeting, but after additional
questioning raised by community members and the district Councillor, she agreed to revisit the
issue in Committee. She said that she believes that the biggest concern was that the developers did
not spend enough time answering questions with the neighborhood group.
Rod Morgan, Attorney representing the Economic Development Commission, said that a request
was made at the Council meeting for the developer to meet with the neighborhood association.
Dan Hubbard, Developer with Woodson, Davis, & Hubbard Development, said that they met with
the neighborhood group on Tuesday, April 12th and went over the timeline and how the bond
financing would work on the proposed project.
Councillor Abduallah asked if this was the first time that the information was presented to the
neighborhood group. Mr. Hubbard answered in the negative and stated that it was the second time
and he felt that the meeting went well as he answered all of the association’s questions. Councillor
Abduallah asked if there was any new information that has not been before the Committee. Mr.
Hubbard answered in the negative.
Jason Holliday, Decatur Township Assessor, said that they agree that affordable housing is needed
throughout the City; however, he believes that Decatur has its adequate share of those homes. He

Economic Development Committee
April 12, 2006
Page 6

said that Decatur Township cannot, at this time, afford anymore of this type of housing. Currently,
the township has 2,411 apartment units, of which 987 or 41% are government subsidized. Of the
987 units, 328 or 33% are 100% tax exempt and equals to approximately $6.5 million of assessed
valuation. The township lost approximately $3 million of assessed value with recent cases of
appeals on Section 42 housing. He said that there is a potential of losing another $1.8 million of
assessed value due to a new state statute. They are also finding that the government subsidized
apartments compete with the market-based apartments, resulting in increased vacancy rates in
market-based communities. He asked that the Committee vote against the proposal.
Chair Nytes said that she was under the impression that this property would pay property taxes and
would not be exempt. Mr. Holliday said that is true, but on a comparable Section 42 development,
$3 million of assessed value has been lost due to appeal.
Pat Andrews, Chair of Land Use Committee of Decatur Township Civic Council, distributed a
handout (attached as Exhibit A). She said that Decatur Township is the smallest township and is
very isolated. She said that most of Decatur Township’s growing industrial base is in a Tax
Increment Financing (TIF) area that will pay off bonds for the Ameriplex infrastructure and United.
Tax base is a critical issue in Decatur because there is not yet a full spectrum of business and
residence. Ms. Andrews said that Decatur is a very affordable and great place to live. She said that
page one of Exhibit A shows results from the 2000 Census Data that indicates that Decatur had the
second lowest median monthly rent of all townships. It shows that approximately half of the
housing stock is assessed at $100,000 or less and nearly all of it is assessed at less than $150,000.
She said that they are trying to find ways to attract the full spectrum of housing options for Decatur
and its residence. The second page on Exhibit A shows that there is almost the same amount of
apartment units being built as single/double family housing and building apartment housing has
doubled in the last five or six years. The last page of Exhibit A shows all apartment developments
in Decatur Township, their total units and the different governmental programs that are available
and being utilized. She said that if this Section 42 development is allowed to move forward,
Decatur will be very close to half of the units being below market. She said that Decatur needs
balance and it is imperative for the township to attract the move-up house market and is in desperate
need of basic retail for everyday buying.
Terry Sylvester, resident of Decatur Township Civic Council, said that a wider spectrum of housing
is needed in Decatur. In the last few years, the bulk of the subdivisions have been “starter” type
homes and asked that the Committee deny the request.
Jeff Bennett, Assistant Administrator, Economic Development Division of the Department of
Metropolitan Development (DMD), said that the difference between “affordable” rent and “marketrate” rate in Marion County for this development is $25 a month, which does not reflect a vastly
different amount. He said, according to the 2000 Census, these types of apartments represent just
over 6% of the housing units in Decatur Township. He said that he is not aware of any housing that
is operated by the Indianapolis Housing Agency in Decatur Township, but the Section 42 housing is
not considered a government subsidy. He said that this developer has not asked for anything from
the City of Indianapolis other than the Council’s approval to proceed. An approval, at this point,
does not guarantee funding. The developer still has to apply for bond volume and tax credits from
the State. The developer then has to return to the Council once the application process is
completed. Mr. Bennett said that this would serve a need and provide affordable housing to
families. He said that DMD staff recommended approval at the Economic Development
Commission level.

Chair Nytes said that, according to the 2000 Census, close to 30% of the people in Decatur
Township were paying 35% or more of their gross income for rent. She asked Mr. Bennett if that is
correct. Mr. Bennett answered in the affirmative and stated that it is a concern because DMD tries
to qualify someone if they are paying more than 30% of their gross monthly income on housing
related expenses.
Councillor Randolph asked why there is a competition against the market. He said that he has
always had an issue with the concept of affordable housing because one could struggle with
affordable housing depending on where one decided to locate or relocate. He said that he sees this
as more of an issue of income than housing. As a person’s income rises, they can then have the
house they want. He said that there are abandoned homes in other townships that could be occupied
and considered “affordable housing”. Mr. Bennett said that there needs to be a balance between
rental and homeownership at all levels of affordability in all townships across the City. He said that
the abandoned housing and foreclosure issue is also being dealt with, but they do not apply to the
issue of this rental development, on this property, in this township. Councillor Randolph said that
he would like to know the average vacancy rate of apartments in Decatur, which would indicate if
there is a need for more housing or if people are simply being shifted from one complex to a newer
complex.
Councillor Cockrum said that the leadership of Decatur Township recognized 15 years ago that
Decatur would be growing very fast and thought that a plan was needed for housing and
commercial development. He said that the Holiday Corporation, which is developing the
Ameriplex Development, came in and has been providing some help in that area. He said that a TIF
area was agreed upon to put in an infrastructure to support that development. The maintenance
facility at the airport got the TIF area expanded and now the township is paying for the United
facility. A lot of the area that the Ameriplex has developed is also being occupied by governmental
agencies that do not pay taxes, so neither of these developments is helping the area. It was first
proposed that the area would be a high income technology park, but has turned out to be more of an
office area or warehousing area that does not bring in high income. The area is currently in need of
promoting a commercial area and will hopefully be coming with a proposal to do so. He said that
the township needs more than simply residential growth as there is nothing in Decatur that is a
destination point. He said that data shows that 5% of all the homes in Decatur are either empty or
owned by absentee owners; there is a high rate of vacant and foreclosed homes. Councillor
Cockrum said that the area that the developer is proposing has no public transportation. There is
only one apartment complex in Decatur that is on the IndyGo route and those people complain that
there is no transportation on the weekends. He said that he would recommend that the proposal not
be approved at this time.
Councillor Conley asked if there is a need for more commercial space to provide for the residential
areas of either apartments or homes. Councillor Cockrum answered in the affirmative and stated
that each home that comes into the township brings in an average of 1.7 children to educate and the
taxes on homes do not pay for those children.
Chair Nytes asked if anyone knows the vacancy rate in rental units in Decatur Township. Mr.
Hubbard said that he is unsure of the exact amount for Decatur, but the market study included a
larger area of the City and was above 90% occupied. Denise Barkdul, Attorney with Ice Miller,
said that she does not recall any Section 42 housing projects that have come before the City since
2000 for Decatur Township. Mr. Hubbard said that there were two in Decatur Township in the last
three years and a total of 19 throughout the remainder of the county. He said that he obtained an

Economic Development Committee
April 12, 2006
Page 8

analysis from the City’s website that illustrates that one of the City’s goals is to encourage
affordable housing developments in outer townships especially in Franklin and Decatur townships.
The analysis stated that the goal is that all townships should have at least 15% of the total renter and
owner on housing stock affordable to households earning 50% of the area median or less. He said,
according to the City’s study and the study done by the developer, this is not the case in Decatur
Township.
Councillor Sanders asked if the developer is aware of how many other applications may be going in
for the state credits. Mr. Hubbard answered in the negative. Councillor Sanders asked what the
impact of the project would be if the developer did not receive the credits. Mr. Hubbard answered
that the developer would not proceed and the land owner would sell to someone else. He said that
the land is currently zoned for multifamily, and the owner wants apartments to be in that area. He
said that the land owner’s plans are for a multifamily unit to be built where the developer is
proposing and single family homes to be built around that unit.
Chair Nytes asked if there is any intention on the part of the community to have the land rezoned.
Councillor Cockrum answered in the negative. Chair Nytes asked what the status is for the single
family development. Mr. Hubbard said that he has heard that construction will begin in May, 2006.
Mr. Hubbard reiterated that the developer is not looking for tax abatement and stated that for
Decatur to encourage commercial and retail to come into an area, there must be adequate housing
because commercial developers look for the number of households that will buy their products.
Ms. Burkdul said that this program is set up with tax credits from the Federal government and the
developers are responsible for repaying all of the bonds. She said that there is no City money
needed to build the facility. She said that the developer is increasing the value of the property, as it
is currently a corn field.
Mr. Morgan said that the Committee will see this again before any final activity is taken, before tax
credits get allocated, and before volume cap gets allocated. He said that the inducement simply
allows the developer to continue dialogue with the community, to study the project to develop it to
its full extent, and to go forward with obtaining the volume cap from the State. He said that it is
also required that the public again be heard on the matter.
Chair Nytes asked when the deadline is for the State to receive the application. Mr. Morgan
answered that the deadline is June 9th.
Councillor Abduallah asked if the Committee could take a short recess for a Caucus. Chair Nytes
said that she would grant a five minute recess.
[Clerk’s note: Committee took a five minute recess from 6:28 p.m. to 6:33 p.m.]
Councillor Conley said that he is thinking about what the neighborhood says they need and this
project would bring about $14 million in tax revenue.
Councillor Conley moved, seconded by Councillor Abduallah, to forward Proposal No. 165, 2006
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 4-3, with
Councillors Cain, Pfisterer, and Randolph casting the negative votes.

[Clerk’s note: Councillor Randolph left at this time 6:34 p.m.]
PROPOSAL NO. 238, 2006 - a special resolution for Lockefield Associates L.P. authorizing the
City of Indianapolis to amend certain provisions of the City of Indianapolis, Indiana Economic
Development Revenue Refunding Bonds (Lockefield Associates L.P. Project), Series 1996A (the
“Bonds”), approving amendments to the financing agreement and indenture and approving and
authorizing other actions in request thereto
Mr. Morgan said that this transaction was originally financed in 1985 of bonds issued to provide
permanent financing for multifamily residential projects of which a portion was to provide rental
units to low to moderate income level persons. He said that it was refinanced in 1996 and required
that any modifications be approved by the Mayor; therefore, it needs to go through the Economic
Development Commission, the Economic Development Committee, and the full Council. The
desire is to amend the documents to allow for modifications of the interest rate and remarketing of
bonds. He said that there is no liability of the City and there are no tax revenues that will be used to
repay the bonds.
Chair Nytes asked if the nature of the complex has changed from what it was originally intended.
Ms. Barkdul answered in the negative. Councillor Abduallah asked if the nature of the complex
could later change. Mr. Morgan said that there are restrictions that would prevent that. Ms.
Barkdul said that when bonds are issued for this type of housing, there are long-term restrictions put
on the use of the facility.
Councillor Conley asked if the agreement is a 12-year or 20-year cycle. Mr. Morgan said that the
changes to the remarketing agreement allow for the changes to be made in three years rather than
originally in 12 years. He said that it will not have to come before the Committee again.
Councillor Sanders moved, seconded by Councillor Conley, to forward Proposal No. 238, 2006 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 6-0.
CONCLUSION
With no further business, and upon motion duly made, the Economic Development Committee of
the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:25 p.m.
Respectfully Submitted,

PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE
The Public Works Committee of the City-County Council met on Thursday, February 21, 2008.
Chair Benjamin Hunter called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m. with the following members
present: Ginny Cain, Dane Mahern, Janice McHenry, Mary Moriarty Adams, Cherrish Pryor,
Christine Scales, and Mike Speedy. Angela Mansfield arrived shortly thereafter.
PROPOSAL NO. 36, 2008 – appoints Harrison R. Smith to the Board of Public Works
Councillor Scales addressed Chairman Hunter with an amendment to strike the name “Harrison
Smith” everywhere it appears (including the digest) and replace it with the name “Robert
Parrin.”
Councillor Scales moved, seconded by Councillor Speedy, to amend Proposal No. 36, 2008, as
shown on Exhibit A. The motion carried by a vote of 8-0.
Chair Hunter asked if Mr. Parrin was in attendance. Mr. Parrin was not present. Chair Hunter
said they would move the proposal to the end of the agenda to allow Mr. Parrin time to arrive.
PROPOSAL NO. 69, 2008 - approves an appropriation of $3,380,000 in the 2008 Budget of the
Department of Public Works (Transportation General Fund) to fund the resurfacing design,
inspection and construction of the streets used in 2007 as local detour routes for the Super 70
project, financed by reimbursements from the Indiana Department of Transportation
Mr. Dave Cleaver, Assistant Administrator of Capital Improvement Financing for Department of
Public Works (DPW), said that this proposal requests that $3,380,000 from the Transportation
General Fund balance be reimbursed by monies from the Indiana Department of Transportation
(INDOT). He said that last year during the Super 70 project, the State agreed to enter into an
agreement with the city for damages to local streets as a result of detour routes created by the
work performed on the interstate. This year they are actually doing the work, and they need the
money appropriated in their budget. Money was not appropriated in their 2008 budget. He said
at the time, they were requested to come back before the council committee and seek to put that
money back into their budget. This action has no impact on the Transportation General Fund
balance, since it will be reimbursed with dollar amounts that will be spent from this
appropriation. Mr. Cleaver introduced Larry Jones, who is over the Transportation section in the
Engineering division, and asked if there any questions about the streets that were on the list.
Councillor Moriarty-Adams asked what streets were going to be covered. Mr. Jones distributed a
handout (attached as Exhibit B), and said that part of the agreement with INDOT, DPW, and the
City of Indianapolis includes a specific set of street segments and estimated costs to do repairs on
those segments. He said this negotiated agreement with INDOT was based on anticipated
damage of the streets which would receive the most traffic and could incur the most damage. Mr.
Jones said these street segments were agreed upon in March 2007, and it was agreed they would
reimburse DPW for expenses due to resurfacing, all except Post Road, because it is a concrete
street which will receive a concrete joint.

Councillor Speedy asked when they anticipate the state reimbursing the city for this money.
Mr. Cleaver said they will be reimbursed after the work has been performed. He said they have
to do the work up front, and the first project is in design right now. The first project is pending,
going out to bid, and waiting on Council action to approve or deny. He said they invoice one at a
time and the project is completed based on the agreement.
Councillor Speedy asked if the State had the money already budgeted, or if they have to seek
certain appropriations as well. Mr. Cleaver said that in the past they have issued purchase orders
for a dollar amount to reimburse DPW. He can find out for sure, but that is the typical way. He
said just like the city, they would have issued a purchase order to a particular vendor if they had
awarded a contract.
Councillor Speedy asked if the state paid pretty promptly. Mr. Cleaver said they are still in
negotiations from the first round of reimbursements on this particular project. He said as part of
this agreement, last year they purchased speed indicator signs for school zones, used a police
helicopter for traffic observation, DPW operations group patched potholes, and extra safety
personnel were put on the streets for handling traffic. He said there have been three invoices
submitted, and the state is still reviewing those invoices. Two invoices were submitted in 2007,
and a revised one was submitted in 2008. Currently the reimbursement amount is approximately
$142,000.
Councillor Pryor asked if this was going to be one bid or separate bids for each street. Mr. Jones
said that currently, design and inspection is under contract. He said they may not be blended
with one program; they are bid out in two packages and maybe three. Councillor Pryor
confirmed again that there could be more than one company to do all of these projects. Mr.
Jones replied in the affirmative.
Councillor Pryor asked about the other streets that may be impacted in that area that are not
listed on Attachment A, and if these streets will be worked on. She asked if there is any type of
consideration for the streets that have not been listed. Mr. Jones said they have their 2008 reservicing program, which is county wide, and there are some streets in that general area that are
selected to be a part of the repairs. He said they are still reviewing that program as far as the
total amount from a funding standpoint. He said the potential may be there to consider other
streets, but they may have to take something off the table. He also said they had planned on
doing a street in that area if it had gotten real bad. But, he said they had already negotiated these
repairs a year ago as to what they thought the condition would be this time this year. He does not
think they have the ability to change these segments or limits, and the only other way they could
do it is with their own funding. Councillor Pryor commented that later on they may have to
approve other streets with the funding they get. Mr. Jones replied this would have to be done
with normal funding.
Councillor Pryor asked when they might be finished with the repairs. She said she realizes they
did not have a start date, but asked when they hope to be finished. Mr. Jones said they hope to
have everything done by Halloween at the latest, but he thinks it may be sooner. He said if they
could get Council approval on these bids and get them under contract, they could start work
immediately, because asphalt plans start up in April.

Councillor Moriarty Adams said East 16th Street is in pretty bad shape from Ritter Avenue east,
and she was not sure how much of that traffic was re-directed off of Shadeland Avenue or
Emerson Avenue onto 16th Street. She asked if there are any plans for 16th Street in that area.
Mr. Jones said he knows they have it on their list to look at, but he does not know that it is an
issue right now. He said that he will look into it and get back with her.
Councillor Mahern asked since these prjects are separate from the normal list the Councillors
have, and since they have already been discussed with the people on the committee, are they
going to be easier to bid than going through the normal process for 2008, or will there be a
different process for all the different districts. Mr. Cleaver said the only thing different is that
they will bid it in packages for only these streets. He said that there might be five street
segments in one, and four in another. Normally, they have bigger projects, sometimes
$1,000,000 projects all over two or three townships. Mr. Cleaver said they are keeping them
separate to make it easy to reconcile financially.
Councillor McHenry said she noticed that in their bid, these costs were figured a year ago. She
wanted to know since these costs were done a year ago, is it a possibility the cost will be higher
now, and if so, who would pick up the difference. Mr. Jones said they are estimates, and if it
goes higher than the dollar amount, the city would have to cover anything over that. He said that
is the way the agreement reads. They are estimates, and they are fairly comfortable with the
costs, but the market will tell them for sure.
{Clerks Note: Councillor Mansfield arrived at 5:43 p.m.}
Councillor McHenry asked at the time of the estimates, if they knew that it was not going to be
done for another year. Mr. Jones said that was correct. They knew at that time it would be bid
this year.
Chair Hunter asked if East Washington Street from I-70 to Post Road is in included in the first
phase. With this being under INDOT control, does DPW have to do anything with that. Mr.
Jones said outside of I-465 is an INDOT project, and it is not the City’s.
Councillor Moriarty-Adams moved, seconded by Councillor Cain, to send Proposal No. 69, 2008
to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 9-0.
Chair Hunter asked the clerk to add his name to Proposal No. 69, 2008, as well.
PROPOSAL NO. 70, 2008- approves an appropriation of $9,000,000 in the 2008 Budget of the
Department of Public Work (Transportation General Fund) to fund the construction of Phases 2
and 3 and the related project design costs for future phases of the downtown Cultural Trail,
funded by a grant from the Central Indiana Community Foundation
Mr. Cleaver said that Lori Miser, Administrator in the Engineering Department of DPW, is the
designee in the department overseeing this project. He said this proposal is a request to
appropriate $9,000,000 of funds donated to the Central Indiana Community Foundation, and

Members of the Public Works Committee
February 21, 2008
Page 4

provided to the City of Indianapolis through a grant, to provide for ongoing design and
inspection of the cultural trail project. He said the first phase is right outside the window on
Alabama, and is nearing completion. The landscaping should be done by early spring. That
project is winding down, and the next two phases will be going to construction later this spring
or mid summer. He said the funds they are appropriating today will probably be spent over the
next twelve to 24 months, and will be used to match some federal funds that have been
earmarked for downtown projects. He said he could answer any questions on the funding aspect,
and Lori could answer specific questions about the trail project and its impact.
Councillor Scales asked if there is something written into this agreement that if the expenses
exceed what has been granted, would the city be responsible to complete the project. Mr. Cleaver
responded that it has been their consistent commitment since this project started that there would
be minimal contribution by the city. He said that so far, the only city funds that have been
applied to this project were for the resurfacing of Alabama Street last year, in conjunction with
the trail project construction. The city agreed that they should probably resurface the street as a
part of the project and replace parking meters for projects, since the city administers the parking
meter program. Other than that, it is a case by case basis. He said if they find an unknown that
they feel is their problem and creation, then the city may be involved financially. From the
standpoint of paying for any overruns on the construction or any aspect of the project, their
limitation is very clear and it has been from the beginning. He said this project is to use only the
donated funds from the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) donated to the city. It is
appropriated in their budget, and should be spent as matching and direct funds to contractors and
design and inspection firms for the completion of this project. He said they are trying to limit any
funds of any capital improvement that would be dedicated toward this project. He also said to
date they have reserved about $200,000 of actual city funds for this project, which was for the
resurfacing of Alabama Street. Mr. Cleaver said there was some minor cleanup at one location
and a purchase of replacement parking meters, but other than that, they have spent $6.7 million
dollars to date, and of that, $200,000 are city funds.
Councillor Mansfield said that she just wanted to stress for the public that these are private funds
that are going for the cultural trail. She said as someone who travels on Alabama Street, it
desperately needed to be repaved. Councillor Mansfield said that sometimes when the public
sees these appropriations, it is really a formality or technicality that they have to go through
when they really private funds. She wants the public to understand that these are not city funds
going to this type of project, when other streets desperately need repair.
Councillor Mahern asked if they know how many people are going to be involved in the next
two phases. He said Alabama is a straight shot and probably the smallest phase so far, but it took
every bit to get it done in time, and now there is going to be significantly more work being done
in these next two phases next year. Ms. Miser explained that there are two phases. The first
phase will be the northeast corridor that will start at North and Alabama and extend to the
Monon, and that will be bid as one contract. She said the second or third phase is the north
corridor from North and Alabama all the way to Blackford and Indiana at the IUPUI campus (a
map of the boundaries is attached as Exhibit C). She said there will be two separate contracts,
and two contracting firms will be working on that.

Councillor Scales said that she had the opportunity to attend the storm water drainage
symposium the other night, and they were talking about using some innovating new techniques
for stormwater overflow to provide for bike paths. She asked if the department is familiar with
that, and if they had given that consideration in this project. Ms. Miser said they are doing that
on Alabama Street. She said they are called stormwater planters and they trap extra stormwater.
They provide filtration so that less of the discharge goes into the combined sewer overflows.
They are being used throughout the trail. Councillor Scales asked if they would continue to be
used. Ms. Miser responded in the affirmative.
Chair Hunter said he would just like to echo what Councillor Mansfield stated, that it is
important for the public to understand that these are private funds. This project is great for a city
of this size, and it is great that then are able to raise the funding to do this.
Councillor Speedy moved, seconded by Councillor Mansfield, to send Proposal No. 70, 2008 to
the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 9-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 36, 2008 – appoints Harrison R. Smith to the Board of Public Works
Chair Hunter said the committee members have a brief resume from Mr. Parrin, whose name was
substituted for the original appointee, Harrison Smith. Mr. Parrin is now present and ready for
questioning
Councillor Mansfield said she looked over the resume that was provided, and obviously Mr.
Parrin adds a great deal of benefit to this board. She asked if he or his company provide services
to the City of Indianapolis. Mr. Parrin answered in the negative, and said that they do no
engineering consulting through companies with the city. Councillor Mansfield asked if he
perceived that there would be a conflict of interest. Mr. Parrin replied that he did not.
Councillor Mansfield asked if he could describe a little more about what his company does.
Mr. Parrin said his company provides Engineering and Management services. He said for
example, he does engineering for a company that is in the wastewater treatment business. They
produce oxygenation systems for wastewater. He is the pump consultant for them, and has spent
30 years of his career in the pump business. That is what he is focused on now. He is also
working for the employer from which he retired as an engineering consultant, and that is also
pump business. Councillor Mansfield asked if it is related to the city. Mr. Parrin said that it is
located in Indianapolis, but they do not do business with the City. He said he has no way to do
business with the city through that company.
Councillor Pryor asked if there is anything that he would like to tell the Committee about
himself, other than what is on his resume. Mr. Parrin said when an acquaintance of his, Allen
Kimbel called and mentioned the possibility of serving on the board, because of his engineering
experience, he did not have to think about it very long. He has lived in Indianapolis with his wife
and kids for a total of 20 years. They have raised their family here. He started his engineering
company upon retirement from the pump company. Although he has lived all over the country,
he made the decision to stay in Indianapolis because he loves the city. He said that he could not
think of a finer place to live. Having said that, he now has some time available, he thinks that his

Members of the Public Works Committee

engineering and management experience will benefit the city. If DPW can benefit from that, that
is what he would like to do.
Councillor Mahern thanked Mr. Parrin for the dedication that it is going to take to be a part of the
board. He said the board takes a lot of work and time. He said that it is one of the most
important committees to the city, because it has a daily affect on people’s lives. Councillor
Mahern also said it is great to see that he is ready, and has the experience to help on the board.
Councillor Mahern moved, seconded by Councillor Speedy, to send Proposal No. 36, 2008 to the
full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote of 9-0.
James Johnson, Budget Analyst for the City Controller’s Office, said that he has been with the
Office of Finance of Management since May of 2007. He introduced their new employee Jason
Dudich, Deputy Controller for the Budget. Councillor Mansfield said that she worked with Mr.
Dudich at the State Budget Agency a few years ago, and she thinks he is a great addition.
Glen Pratt, citizen, stated that he spent most of his life working with the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency. He said that he was also an Assistant Commissioner at the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management (IDEM). After retirement, he decided to work with
government on environmental concerns. One of the major problems in this community is raw
sewage flowing through the neighborhoods because of failing septic tanks. He said there is a
septic tank elimination program in place that is moving ahead, and he strongly urged the council
to keep this as a high priority. He said that drainage is also an issue. He said he hopes that with
the new council and the new committee, that they can continue to focus on not only making the
cultural trails nice, but they need to eliminate the sewage trail and bring safe water to the people.
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Works Committee of
the City-County Council was adjourned at 6:03 p.m.

PUBLIC SAFETY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE
The Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council met on
Wednesday, August 9, 2006. Chair Mary Moriarty Adams called the meeting to order at
5:40 p.m., with the following members present: Greg Bowes, Vernon Brown, Sherron
Franklin, Lynn McWhirter, Lincoln Plowman, and Scott Schneider. Absent was William
Oliver.
Address from Judge Cale Bradford
Judge Bradford distributed a series of orders that the court has ordered to help alleviate jail
overcrowding (Exhibit A, attached). Some of the orders are as follows:
•

Effective August 21, 2006 a night court will be established in an existing court to
handle new and targeted D-felony cases.

•

A Warrant Strike Team will be developed to target defendants who do not appear
for court and arrest them the same day.

•

Add a half time commissioner to create a third daily docket in drug court to
expedite major felony drug cases.

•

Add more prosecutors and public defenders that will man the courts, including
night court.

•

Effective immediately defendants held at Marion County jail on behalf of another
county will be moved to that county within 48 hours.

•

The Marion County Crime Lab is directed to eliminate its current backlog by hiring
two additional certified examiners and latent fingerprint examiners.

•

Community Corrections has seven days to return to court with recommendations
on defendant placements (i.e. appropriate for work releases, home detention, etc.).

•

The executive committee requires all departments or agency to maximize the use of
their existing resources.

Judge Bradford said the projected cost of these orders for the remainder of the year is $2.2
million. He said these changes need to be permanent; therefore, for the entire year of 2007
the projected cost is $5.1 million.
Councillor Franklin asked if these orders were put into effect without knowing how the
orders are going to be funded. Judge Bradford replied in the affirmative and said some of
these orders are budget neutral and are most likely included in the budget request for next
year.

Councillor Plowman asked if the warrant strike team is going to require additional staff.
Sue Patterson, Court Services Agency, said five additional staff is in the request of the
newly formed warrant strike team. Councillor Plowman asked if there is a time frame for
the firearm examiners to eliminate their backlog. Judge Bradford said a time frame is not
set; however, examiners are to be hired immediately. Councillor Plowman asked if these
orders are enough to help with jail overcrowding. Judge Bradford said he cannot guarantee
there will be no more inmate managed releases. He said this problem took a long time to
develop and these orders will help improve the problem.
PROPOSAL NO. 422, 2006 - approves an increase of $1,100,000 in the 2006 Budget of
the Marion County Sheriff (County General Fund) to contract for additional jail beds
beginning in 2006
Major Ronald Chappell, Marion County Sheriff Department (MCSD), said this proposal
will provide the County Sheriff with $1,100,000 in addition to a commissary amount of
$500,000, in order to house 200 more prisoners at Jail II. He directed the committee to
(Exhibit B, attached), which illustrates the cost and the increase in jail beds at Jail II. He
said over a six month projection the cost of a jail bed would be $43.75; however,
currently they pay Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) $42.75. Therefore, more
research needs to be done in order to find out which figure will be used. Major Chappell
said if $42.75 is the figure that will be used they can move 259 prisoners into Jail II. He
said if they wait until September 1, 2006 to move prisoners they could move 307
prisoners into Jail II.
Councillor Bowes asked if it is necessary to have over 400 new jail beds because of a
huge release in one month. Major Chappell said they may not have to use the additional
jail beds. He said they pay as beds are needed.
Councillor Franklin asked if the requested money is already in the budget. Robert
Clifford, City Controller, said the $1,100,000 will be a loan from the Sanitary Fund to the
County General Fund. He said they anticipated this loan in the budget projections, and it
is expected to be paid back in 2007.
Councillor Plowman asked how long the requested beds are available. Major Chappell
said this proposal is asking for jail beds until December 31, 2006.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if CCA’s contract expires the end of this year. Major
Chappell replied in the affirmative. Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the county is bidding
out a contract. Mr. Clifford said they are trying to use competition to keep the price on
the bid down.
Councillor Bowes moved, seconded by Councillor Brown, to send Proposal No. 422,
2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote
of 7-0.

PROPOSAL NO. 423, 2006 - approves an appropriation of $3,114,000 in the 2006
Budget of the Marion County Sheriff (Consolidated County Fund) to fund rental of
additional jail beds under contracts with the Department of Corrections and Corrections
Corporation of America
Councillor Schneider said Prosecutor Carl Brizzi would like to present this proposal to
the Criminal Justice Planning Council (CJPC) before the Council takes a vote on this
proposal. He said he would like to postpone this proposal until the next committee
meeting after the CJPC.
Councillor McWhirter asked if postponing this proposal will affect the vote taken on
Proposal 422, 2006. Major Chappell said this is a different issue than the Proposal 422,
2006 and the vote taken on this proposal will not affect the vote taken on Proposal 422,
2006.
Councillor Bowes asked if this proposal is an overlap of what was passed in Proposal
422, 2006. Councillor Schnedier replied in the affirmative and said the purpose of this
proposal is if the Sheriff still feels there is a need to utilize the New Castle facility.
Councillor Schneider moved, seconded by Councillor McWhirter, to “Postpone”
Proposal No. 423, 2006 until August 30, 2006. The motion carried by a vote of 7-0.
PROPOSAL NO. 424, 2006 - amends the Code to authorize a new general fee to be
known as the "police department vehicle inspection fee"
Earl Morgan, Director of the Department of Public Safety, said this proposal requests
authorization for a vehicle inspection fee. He said an application for certificate of title for
a motor vehicle or a recreational vehicle may not be accepted by the Bureau of Motor
Vehicles unless the vehicle has been inspected by a police officer. He said many of the
surrounding counties have already instituted a $5.00 vehicle inspection fee. Mr. Morgan
said the revenues have to be used for the Local Law Enforcement continuing Education
Fund if collected by a police officer. If collected by a Sheriff, the revenue must go to a
vehicle inspection fund.
Councillor McWhirter asked if $5.00 is the maximum fee that can be charged. Mr.
Morgan said that Indiana statute states that this be the maximum fee. Councillor
McWhirter asked how much revenue the new fee will generate. Mr. Morgan said he does
not have that information at this time. Councillor McWhirter asked how the fee would be
collected. Mr. Morgan said they are working on the details on how to collect the fee. He
said he believes it may be collected through an application process.
Councillor Bowes asked what is being inspected and how often. Mr. Morgan said all
vehicles except new cars will be inspected because it is necessary to make sure the
vehicle is not stolen and there is no connection to criminal activity. Councillor Bowes
asked if an inspection is needed on used cars sold through a dealer. Mr. Morgan replied

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 9, 2006
Page 5
in the affirmative. Councillor Bowes asked how many used cars are sold in a year. Mr.
Morgan said that information is not available at this time; however, it is definitely
something that can be researched.
Councillor Plowman asked if the inspection also includes water craft. Mr. Morgan
replied in the affirmative.
Councillor Franklin moved, seconded by Councillor Plowman, to send Proposal No. 424,
2006 to the full Council with a “Do Pass” recommendation. The motion carried by a vote
of 7-0.
BUDGET HEARIING
Overview – City Controller
Mr. Clifford gave the 2007 Budget Overview for Public Safety and Criminal Justice
(Exhibit C, on file in the Council office). Some highlights of the presentation are as
follows:
•

The mayor has asked the Council to revise the introduced budget to allow the
highest priority to be given to Public Safety and Criminal Justice.

•

The goal is to budget for expenses approved by the CJPC and allocate sources
efficiently for the two mergers.

•

Some budget challenges are: the rise in criminal justice expenses, the rise in
pension obligations, funding employee raises, and bringing county employees to
minimum salaries, etc.

•

The 2007 introduced budget still needs three million dollars to be identified in
savings to be funded and additional money will likely be needed for Criminal
Justice this year.

•

Public Safety budget has increased by $54 million of which $17 million is the
transfer of funding for the Washington Township Fire Department budget due to
the merger.

•

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) has moved to the city
side of the budget and the Sheriff will be over both city and county funds.

Chair Moriarty Adams asked if savings can be acquired due to health insurance increases
being lower over past years. Mr. Clifford replied in the negative and said they do not put
the budget together until they receive a final read on the cost of health insurance.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee

Councillor Bowes asked what the minimum salary is that a county employee will receive
under the new proposal. Jeff Seidenstein, Budget Manager, said the minimum for county
employees working 37.5 hours per week is $18,163 and those working 40 hours per week
is $19,375.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked if the increase in police officers will increase the number of
sworn and authorized officers. Mr. Clifford replied in the negative and said recruit
classes have began, but they cannot get enough recruits to bring them back up to sworn
and authorized numbers due to the retirement of police officers.
Councillor Franklin asked if a breakdown of the savings is available. Mr. Clifford said
savings are being identified by reductions of duplicate offices and positions. He said they
are also comparing this year’s budget to the 2007 budget. Councillor Franklin stated that
she does not understand why the pay period of police officers is being compared to 2007.
Mr. Clifford said they budgeted in 2007 that all the sworn officers will make the same
pay based on the same levels of experiences. Councillor Franklin asked if they were
going to review those businesses that received tax abatement. Mr. Clifford replied in the
affirmative and said the Department of Metropolitan Development looks into tax
abatements.
Councillor Plowman asked if the budget has changed due to the executive court order.
Mr. Clifford said the changes are not included in the introduced budget and the funding
for this order will likely come from the city’s reserve funds.
Chair Moriarty Adams asked how the spending of the city’s reserve funds will affect
bond rating. Mr. Clifford said it will have an effect on the bond rating, but we are still
declared a healthy and growing city.
Councillor Schneider asked if public safety is funded in the budget. Mr. Clifford said the
$54 million is funded in the budget, but more money is needed to put towards the justice
system in Marion County. He said the city’s budget is fully funded; however, the county
budget is short three million dollars.
Forensic Services Agency
Mike Medler, Director of the Forensic Services Agency, gave the agency’s budget
presentation (Exhibit D, on file in the Council office). Some highlights are as follows:
•

The agency has been able to hire new examiners due to County Option Income
Tax (COIT) money to address their backlogged cases.

•

The agency’s overall goal is to reduce turnaround time to six weeks in all forensic
disciplines to expedite court cases.

•

Crime lab funding is not only a local problem, but a nationwide problem.

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 9, 2006
Page 7
•

There are 544 firearm cases through August 1, 2006 and the current backlog is
501 cases.

•

The agency has experienced difficulty in attracting experienced forensic scientists
due to the current salary structure.

•

Increase in Character 2 (Supplies) due to additional fuel cost; Character 3
(Services) increase is due to the Information Service Agency (ISA) restructuring
of how the charges are being provided; and Character 4 (Assets) there is a
reduction of $58,000 for the 2007 budget only.

•

Due to the executive court order Character 1 (Personnel) has been increased to
$3,906,806.

Councillor Plowman asked how long it will take to handle the backlog cases with
additional staff. Mr. Medler said if the person is trained and qualified they can do the
work in a month or less. He said if the person is directly out of college, it takes about a
year to train them. Mr. Medler said a good firearms examiner will do eight to ten cases a
month.
Mr. Clifford asked if the increase in Character 1 includes paying more for firearm
examiners. Mr. Medler said it includes current staff and new employees.
Bart Brown, Chief Financial Officer, asked if they are only anticipating an increase in
Character 1 due to the court order. Mr. Medler said the increase in 2006 is only for
Character 1, but in 2007 there will be additional increases due to equipment, fuel, etc.
Marion County Public Defender’s Agency
David Cook, Public Defender, gave the agency’s budget presentation (Exhibit E, on file in
the Council office). Some highlights are as follows:
•

The agency has experienced a problem with attorneys refusing to take additional
Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) cases due to huge caseloads.

•

A solution to this growing problem is to transfer $450,000 from Character 3 to
Character 1 to provide for nine full time attorneys and request funding for five
additional attorneys.

•

The agency will need 17 full time staff for four new courts and eight contract
attorneys.

•

The Public Defender Commission projects that four million dollars in revenue
will be realized for 2007, if the agency is in full compliance of the commission’s

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 9, 2006
Page 8
new standards. To be in compliance the agency will need 14 D felony full time
attorneys.
•

Attorneys are currently sharing offices due to the increase in staff. The agency is
currently looking into consolidating staff to one central location and is also
working on a proposal to obtain new space.

Councillor Plowman asked what the process is for hiring new attorneys. Mr. Cook said
they go through the bar association, by word of mouth, etc.
Debra Green, Public Defender Agency, said the executive court order has made an
impact on the agency’s budget of approximately $1,166,204, which is not included in the
introduced budget. She said this increase represents an additional 17 employees both
contract and full time. Ms. Green said nine of the TPR attorneys are being funded out of
contracts in Character 3 of their existing budget. She said Character 1 reflects a huge
increase due to health insurance, pension, and social security being under funded in the
2006 budget. She said there is an increase in Line Item 359 (Building Rent), 366, (Office
Remodeling), and 371 (Rent) in anticipation of moving out of the City-County Building.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the $16 million funds all their increases in staff. Ms.
Green said they are asking for an additional $1,166,204 to accommodate the executive
court order. She said in addition they are requesting $1,008,000, which represents the
$450,000 that is being transferred from Character 3 to Character 1 for the TPR positions.
Metropolitan Emergency Communications Agency (MECA)
Ray Raney, Director of MECA, said MECA provides infrastructure for public safety in
Marion County. He said their staff consists of 22 full-time employees, who support public
safety and the public service radio system, as well as computer dispatch to 911 telephone
systems. Mr. Raney said the agency also provides a help desk seven days week, 24 hours a
day. He said the agency maintains a tremendous amount of electronic equipment. He said
the biggest challenge facing the agency is maintaining their 16 year old radio system. Mr.
Raney said they are in the process of replacing the radio system and anticipated the new
radio system to be operational in the next 24 months.
Leslie Wilson, Administrative Manager, said the agency has two separate funds; the
MECA fund and the Emergency Telephone Communications Fund. She said there are no
increases in Character 1 (Salaries) and the decrease is due to the changes in fringes; in
Character 2 (Supplies) there is an increase of $6,500 due to the increases in fuel; in
Character 3 (Other Services and Charges) there is a decrease of $324,555, the bulk of the
deduction is in COIT.
Councillor McWhirter asked if the three percent raise is going to be figured in their budget.
Mr. Clifford replied in the affirmative and said the raise is not in their budget at this time.
Councillor McWhirter asked what the decrease in COIT was. Mr. Seidenstein said the

Public Safety and Criminal Justice Committee
August 9, 2006
Page 9
decrease is reimbursing the Sheriff’s department and the Indianapolis Fire Department for
their cost of the dispatching operations.
CONCLUSION
With no further business pending, and upon motion duly made, the Public Safety and
Criminal Justice Committee of the City-County Council was adjourned at 9:08 p.m.
