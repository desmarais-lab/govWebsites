**** UNFINISHED BUSINESS ****
Insurance reportâ€”Mrs. Stoll informed the Council that out of the four
agencies that submitted proposals for our property and workmanâ€™s comp
insurance for the City and the Attica Fire Department, two agencies were
overall the most competitive. The proposals were presented to the Board of
Works on December 6, 2016. Upon evaluation by the board, the firm of Witkemper
Insurance Group was awarded the business. In 2016, the City paid $80,626 for
our city package, city workmanâ€™s comp and the fire department package. In
2017, we will pay $63,961 with the Witkemper Insurance Group. This amounts to a
$16,665 reduction in costs.

no parking from a stop sign. Police Officer Snoeberger remarked that vehicles
should not be parked within 20 ft. (1car length) of a stop sign. The topic of
angled parking near this intersection has been discussed in the past as being a
nuisance. More vehicles can park diagonally and have been parked that way for
many years. A motion was made by Mr. Madden to read Ordinance # 15, 2016 for
the third time and adopt, Mrs. Maus seconded the motion. Mrs. Stoll performed a
roll call for votes, the vote was 4-0, and the motion passed.
