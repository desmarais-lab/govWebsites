Upon Motion duly made by Mr. Smart, seconded by Mr. Gayler and adopted, Minutes
from the previous Board of Works Meeting for December 20, 2016 were approved as
written.

There were no citizen’s petitions to be heard.
**** Department Head Reports ****
Ron Jean, Street and Water Supervisor was present with nothing to report.
Police Chief Bob Cole was not present.
Fire Chief, Ed O’Farrell was present and reported they have had 39 runs in
December and 268 runs for the year (2016).
Jeff Pyke, the Building Commissioner was present. He has not contacted Mr.

the Board of Works meeting.
**** Unfinished Business ****
There was none.
**** New Business ****
Utility Credits; Mr. Smart made a motion to approve, Mr. Gayler seconded, the
motion was passed.
Claims; Mr. Gayler made a motion to approve, Mr. Smart seconded, the motion was
passed.
Mr. Smart called to inquire about the properties owned by Jarvis, Bieneman,
Attica Hotel LLC, Darling LLC to confirm that they are all scheduled to be sold
at the Fountain County Commissioners Sale on Feb. 9 at 10 am. It is confirmed
that they are scheduled to go up for sale during that meeting.
Mr. Smart also spoke to a gentleman named John Toomy on the subject of giving
tax abatements for new businesses as an incentive.
Mr. Smart will be meeting with Tommy Klekner from Indiana Landmarks on Thursday
at 10 AM to talk about the condition of our downtown buildings and to discuss
if Mr. Klekner has any ideas about potential buyers/investors for any of the
properties which are currently neglected and/or up for sale in the FC
Commissioners sale.
Mr. Smart also began to look into blight grants but did not have many details
to share at this point in time.
In general, Mr. Smart is wondering what the City might be able to do to give
incentives for rehabbing downtown buildings into viable businesses. It is
thought that the Council would have to make those types of decisions.

seconded and the meeting was adjourned at 4:52 pm. The next Board of Works
meeting will be held on Tuesday, January 17, 2017 at 4:30 pm.
