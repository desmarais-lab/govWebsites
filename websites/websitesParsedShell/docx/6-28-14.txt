* Approval of Board Minutes: 
Andy Fogle asked for a motion to approve the Board minutes from June 19, 2014. The motion was made and seconded; Marion County Community Corrections Advisory Board meeting minutes were approved for June 19, 2014. 
* Current Jail Numbers: Colonel Dezelan: Colonel Dezelan reported the current Marion County Jail numbers to the board. Colonel Dezelan spoke briefly regarding the rise in Marion County Jail numbers due to a new offender maintenance system.  Col. Dezelan reiterated the impact that Community Corrections has made reducing Marion County Jail population in the past and hopes MCCC will continue to do so. John Deiter presented current numbers for MCCC on how Community Corrections is pleased to work with Marion County Jail on continuing to help reduce the jail population. 

* Discuss Probationary Period for DOC  -  discussion was held regarding MCCC being placed on probation by DOC and the possible effects this could have with regards to funding. The problem identified as being the reason for the probationary period is that MCCC is not in compliance with the Field Contact Standards established by the Indiana Risk Assessment System, the root cause for MCCC not meeting these standards is due to a lack in funding for adequate number of case managers, lack of funding for a Field Team, lack of funding to adequately staff the intake department and the instability of maintaining MCCC vendors. 


With no further business before the Board, the meeting was adjourned at 1:33pm. 

**The next MCCC advisory board meeting will be on August 21, 2014 in room 260 (CCB) starting at 12:00pm
