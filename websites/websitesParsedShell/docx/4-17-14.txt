* Discussion RFI: Chairman Fogle gave a brief explanation regarding the need for an RFI (Request for Information) between probation and Community Corrections, in order to share resources and information that would be helpful to all clients' whether ordered to probation or Community Corrections. 

  * Discussion Request for Letter of Support: Justice Center: Discussion was held between board members regarding providing a letter of support to the mayor's office in support of the GM location for the future Justice Center. Several members requested the letter of support exclude the Airport location as an option. Several board members made it clear their vote was on behalf of themselves and not on behalf of the agencies they represent. One board member abstained from a vote all other members approved with the exclusion of the Airport as a possible location due to the hardship this would place on clients as most clients would find it difficult securing transportation. 

  * Update Security at Duvall Residential Center: Chris Morrison gave a brief explanation as to the progress of the new security staff at Duvall Residential Center. Chris explained his gratitude for the training the staff has received that was provided by the Marion County Sheriff's office as well as the Department of Corrections.  Chris also stated the staff is adjusting very well and has great confidence the switch from outside security to all County staff  will be a success.
