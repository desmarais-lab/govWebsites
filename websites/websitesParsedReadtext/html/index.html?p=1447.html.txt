Cindy Mason presented information regarding a desire to have the Council support the implementation of a 1% Food & Beverage Tax. She gave a handout to the Council. The revenue raised from the tax will be used for Attica. It is not certain how much the tax would raise but Rockville had revenues of $90,000.00 in 2016 from the same tax. The Council would have to pass a resolution supporting a Food & Beverage Tax to signal to the State Legislature that we have local support to pursue this tax.       Mrs. Mason passed out a list of Indiana counties, towns and cities that have a 1% Food & Beverage Tax. Mr. Hall motioned to read Resolution # 5, 2017, A Resolution Supporting A Food and Beverage Tax. Mrs. Maus seconded. All were in favor and the motion passed. Mr. Hall motioned to adopt Resolution # 5, 2017 and Mr. Askren seconded, all were in favor and the motion passed. Mr. Madden suggested that a Lodging Tax for the City might be a good idea in the future.
Officer Pearman has left the Attica Police Department. A Council Member has expressed interest in not replacing the officer due to the financial impact that it has on the budget. Mr. Askren asked attorney Tom O’Connor if the Council sets policy for the City.       He also asked if the current Chief of Police is working Monday-Friday day shifts with other officers working the around the clock shifts. He asked Assistant Chief Snoeberger if he used to work the day shift when he was Chief. Mr. O’Connor stated that this issue might be a policy issue but it also might be an administrative issue.Mayor Roderick stated that he thinks that the amount of calls the Attica police get are too high for a reduction in the current number of police. He also stated that when sick and vacation time is taken, we would not be able to staff an officer for each shift. Mayor Roderick asserted that the Chief runs the department as he sees fit.

Matthew Madden asked Chief if a study has been conducted to determine staffing needs? Chief Cole said that a study has not been done. Mr. Madden said the current 12 hour shifts are beneficial to the police but this scheduling choice creates 4 hours of OT per period. He asked if OT is being paid. It is not. Mr. Madden asked Chief Cole if he feels we are operating with the minimum staff? Chief Cole stated that 7 officers and 1 SRO (8 total) would be ideal. The City had 6 officers and 1 SRO (7 total), before Officer Pearman quit. Chief Cole stated Fountain County officers are not actively covering Attica and that is one of our problems. Another is the higher violent crime in Attica versus in Fountain County.
Mayor Roderick complimented Officer Askren on his job as the SRO. Mr. Madden said he was in support of the SRO as well. He said his kids have a relationship with Officer Kyle Askren and he is a good role model for them and all students at the school. Chris Gayler, an Attica School Board Member, spoke on the school’s behalf and stated that they are appreciative of the cities’ contribution to part of the SRO’s pay. The SRO has been a huge benefit to the school. Officer Askren also expressed his desire to continue as the SRO.
Mrs. Maus supports replacing the departing officer. Mr. Hall does not wish to replace unless it means we lose the SRO, and Mr. Askren does not wish to replace the Officer we lost. Mr. Madden asked Assistant Chief Snoeberger for his opinion, he stated that there are more manpower issues in the summer and it would be difficult to operate with one less officer at those times. The day shift receives more calls than night. Officer Durnil gave an example that recently he had to go to Lafayette to pick up a prisoner and stay with them in Court. In an instance such as this, he needed a backup. Mr. Larson stated they cannot rely on the Fountain County Sheriff’s Office to provide back-up due to their number of calls and the miles they cover.
Mrs. Maus made a motion to hire a replacement for the departing officer. Mr. Madden seconded. The motion passed.
Darin Odle applied for a building permit to build an auto body repair business on a 10-acre tract of land south of the City and east of US 41. This property is not in City limits but is within a 2-mile radius of City limits which subjects it to City zoning laws.       The property is currently zoned Conservation. Since the proposed use doesn’t conform with the current zoning designation, Mr. Pycke denied the building permit. Mr. Hall made a motion and Mr. Askren seconded to refer the matter to the Area Panning Commission for a request to rezone the property.
MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS
Susan Stoll presented a recap of the Sycamore Street reconstruction project. The project was put out for construction bids by INDOT. The lowest bid came in at $2,147,429.17 from White Construction Inc/Clinton, IN. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) will pay $1,717, 943.34 and the City is required to pay the 20% match of $429,485.83. This match must be paid immediately in a lump sum. Mrs. Stoll proposed that the following funds be used to pay the match: $38,653.72 from the Water Operating Fund, $94,486.88 be paid from the Storm Water Operating Fund, $100,000 be paid from the MVH Rainy Day Fund and $196,345.23 be paid from the General Rainy Day Fund. A handout was passed out giving the details of the reasoning behind using these funds.

At 7:20 the meeting was adjourned. Next Council meeting will be held Monday February 13, 2017.
