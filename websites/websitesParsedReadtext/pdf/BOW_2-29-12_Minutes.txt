                 FROM: SAM SHAPIRA, CIVIL/ TRAFFIC ENGINEER
                 RE:     ROAD CLOSURE ON 7TH AVENUE FROM JEFFERSON STREET TO
                         MADISON ST. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BACKWASH FACILITY.
                          IN‐AWC. BORMAN PARK WATER TREATMENT PLANT
                 DATE: FEBRUARY 24, 2012
Attached hereto is an email from Art Knapp, Project Superintendent of River City Construction,
requesting to close 7th Avenue from Jefferson Street to Madison Street. The duration of the closure is
approximately 3 months‐ March 1st to June 1st.
During the closure, Traffic Control will monitor the activities and will inform the emergency agencies of
impending closure. Traffic will be detoured to the adjacent street. Signage and barricades will be posted.
I respectfully request the Board of Public Works and Safety to approve this request.
Attachments:
1. Email from Art Knapp

                 TO:     SAM SHAPIRA, CIVIL/ TRAFFIC ENGINEER
                 FROM: ART KNAPP, PROJECT MANAGER
                 DATE: FEBRUARY 22, 2012
We at River City Construction are requesting an emergency street shutdown. The location of this
request is 7th Avenue between Jefferson Street and Madison Street. We think only the east half of this
city block would need to be barricaded off, which would leave alley access to the south (there is no alley
to the north).
Construction excavation has potentially weakened the soil around three separate power poles. NIPSCO
engineering finds it necessary to brace those poles back to the street.
The street shutdown would be incorporated with our previous submitted plan at a later date.
Mr. President, I move that we approve the road closure on 7th Avenue from Jefferson to Madison Street.
                                                                                                          7

Thank you for your consideration.
                  TO:       BEN CLEMENT
                  FROM: DAVID MUNCHAK, PRODUCER O’BROTHER LO
                  DATE: FEBRUARY 21, 2012
This is a letter of intent to inform you of the details of the music video for the band O’Brother and their
song entitled “LO”.
We intend to film on the grounds of the Methodist Church property located at 577 Washington Street
in Gary, IN. Filming will take place on Sunday, March 4, 2012. Our time on the premises would begin at
5am and will continue to no later than 8pm. We will have a crew consisting of approximately 15
individuals but could reach up to 20 people.
Here is the synopsis of the video. The video will follow a trio of neighborhood youths as they spend a
lazy afternoon exploring their town. It is a town with rundown properties, trash on the streets, and
graffiti on the wall. The youths are troublemakers and they spend their day drinking openly from liquor
bottles and later breaking bottles on the street. They smoke cigarettes. They steal an old bike chained
                                                                                                               8

up on a bike rack. They mug a man on the street for his wallet and rough him up a bit. The youths have
no respect for the world they live in, but they do take some time to play with the neighborhood dog.
They eventually come across an old church and are fascinated by it. Even though they know their
neighborhood well, it’s as though they discover the church for the first time. They decide to creep in and
explore. They eventually come across an odd‐ looking creature amongst the rubble and debris inside the
church. They are scared and fascinated, but when they approach, the creature spits out a smaller but
horrific‐ looking creature. It is an otherworldly beast but it has odd human features, like human teeth
and a small human arm. The video concludes with the youths reacting to the site of the thing. They are
at once fascinated, confused, scared. Nothing happens to the youths except for them running out of the
church.
We will spend our single day in Gary filming the youths entering and exiting the church and finding the
creature in the rubble and then reacting to it. None of the story elements or destructive actions of the
youths will be filmed on that day. Everything else will already have been filmed in Chicago.
Mr. President, I move that we approve the request to film in Gary, March 4, 2012.
