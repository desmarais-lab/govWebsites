Preventing Mercury Pollution

If you a re a baby-boomer, you may remember playing with liquid mercury in
the chemistry lab.

Today we know that mercury is highly toxic to humans and can damage the
liver, kidneys and brain.  If swallowed, it can affect the central nervous
system.  Unborn babies and children are the especially sensitive to mercury
toxicity.  Mercury does not break down to less toxic forms in the
environment and accumulates in the bodies of humans, fish and other
animals.

Because mercury is a liquid at room temperature and because it easily
evaporates into the air, it can enter the environment very easily.  A very
small amount of mercury can cause a big problem.  Just 3 grams of mercury
can contaminate a 60 acre lake.  A typical mercury thermometer alone
contains ½ to 2 grams of mercury.
Once mercury is in the environment, it can be very difficult to clean up.
It spreads easily and stays around for a long time.  About two-thirds of
the mercury found in the environment today is there because of human
activity.  Mercury is released as pollution when coal is burned in electric
generating plants.  It also comes form industrial processes and from
improper disposal of household products that contain mercury.  It is
believed that much of the mercury in rivers and streams is actually
deposited there from this airborne pollution.

Mercury may be found in many common household and industrial items
including:
    • Thermometers with silver-colored liquid inside
    • Thermostats – non-electric
    • Clothes irons with an automatic shut-off function
    • Fluorescent light bulbs and mercury-vapor lamps
    • Some latex paint manufactured before 1990 – mercury was used to
      inhibit the growth of mold
    • Batteries (Mercuric oxide and some alkaline batteries)
    • Gauges such as barometers and older blood pressure meters
    • Scientific apparatus
    • Electrical switches on appliances such as space heaters, freezers and
      sump pumps
    • Laboratory chemicals
    • Antibacterial products containing thimerosal or merbromin

Want to help prevent mercury pollution?  Here are some simple steps:
    • Learn about common products that contain mercury
    • Make a list of the products in your home that contain mercury using
      the Household Mercury Source Identification checklist available on the
      City’s website at www.cityoffortwayne.org
    • Avoid buying products that contain mercury except for fluorescent
      light bulbs.  Fluorescent bulbs use less electricity than incandescent
      bulbs.
    • Keep mercury containing items out of the trash.  Use appropriate
      disposal methods or recycle mercury containing products
    • Make an effort to reduce reliance on coal burning by conserving
      electricity whenever possible
